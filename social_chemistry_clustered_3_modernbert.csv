3,akkcpn,t2_61b3s,sadsquash,"You're clearly NTA. Sorry about your homophobic family. I'm assuming you're an adult, and if you're not financially dependent on them at all then who says you have to spend time with them at all? Why would you want to be around hateful and ignorant people who make you sad. I hope you have a good support system elsewhere in your life with people who treat you the way a family should. "
3,alro7y,t2_cxmhejk,SpaceAgeHamburger,"YTA for violating the privacy of your friend's phone. You should have asked first and made it clear why and how much it meant to you. If they still wouldn't delete them, that would make them a dick. It's understandable that you wanted the pictures deleted, but think of it this way: if someone got hold of your phone and deleted something, or downloaded something, or messed with it, wouldn't you consider that a jerk move regardless of their motivation?"
3,alro7y,t2_1n7ia2ai,UnknownNaiad,ESH - yeah you accidentally sent the photos but that’s the risk with social media of any kind. Digging in someone else’s stuff makes you super intrusive. She sucks for teasing you if you asked her to stop and she didn’t. You need to learn physical boundaries and she needs to learn emotional ones. 
3,adwxny,t2_2m8od169,stevencri,"YTA. Live Dave said, you waited until pretty last minute to change things after he already bought a place. You didn’t give him too much of a heads up in finding a new place/new roommate either. It probably would’ve been cheaper for Dave to live in a split house, and he probably still wants to live with you, but now it’s too late. You should’ve considered your options earlier instead of 2 weeks before Dave moves into his new house. "
3,aka65b,t2_vkzyd20,Min_sora,"YTA - Your dad is working to give you a life he couldn't have, and you care more about what some random girls who aren't even your friends think. In a decade you won't even know where these girls are and you'll feel like a spoilt brat for treating your dad this way. "
3,aka65b,t2_1o426oy,margaretyewong,"YTA. But I’ve been in your shoes. Immigrant parents and I went to a rich all-girl Catholic school. You don’t get it now, but you will when you’re older. Your dad is doing all of this for you. So that you have every opportunity that he didn’t. Private school, extracurriculars, nice things, college. Go give your dad a hug and apologize. If these girls were really your friends, they would understand. If they aren’t, then they really won’t matter in the long run."
3,aka65b,t2_jr5of,lavasca,YTA You’ll see it in a few years. Better to deal with embarrassment now than in college. Toughen up. That sale paid for your tuition. Critique your dad’s smoking because it jeopardizes his health not because it embarrasses you.
3,aka65b,t2_deuyp12,thesugarslug,YTA. He’s trying to provide for you. I get that girls can be mean. I was a teenage girl once. But damn give the man a break
3,a4hfkv,t2_jeme7,OffnOnWriter,"Your question is off based. It's not about whether you're an asshole for not liking Christmas (you're not), it's whether you're an asshole for what you said to your mother (you are). \- I doubt she cared whether you hung one ornament or not, it was about having that time together. \- you say no and then tell her you don't care, and then tell her you thought she did all the decorating and Christmas celebration for herself, which makes it sound like you think she's incredibly self-absorbed. &#x200B; I'm not sure about all the rest you say she talks about; sounds like this opened the floodgates to a couple of topics. YTA for how you handled that though."
3,9w539i,t2_17gma2,BelligerentBenny,Is the driver retarded? I thought this was gonna be about him having an earbud in What the fuck? NTA because no ear bud. And in my state you wouldn't be able to drive with an earbud in. 
3,b3hvgo,t2_1lvya3g0,crinklebosslava,"I’m going to say YTA. It’s hard to say whether the employee was really condescending based on your saying it was condescending. By facts, the employee is right. You broke a rule. He chose to enforce it. You also seem to agree the facts were on his side. Your main contention is his condescending tone. I think you could have handled it another way. You handled the situation by saying in beginning it wasn’t a problem the past four years and you spend a lot of money there. True. But said like that, it just smells entitled. You didn’t really acknowledge you broke a rule. What you could have said was - I know we went over the time. Can you do us a favor. I didn’t know it was a big problem. THEN state what you had stated about past four years and 25000. Admit fault which you did do. Then ask for the favor and why you deserve it. And if you have a problem with the tone, say it to his face directly! "
3,b3hvgo,t2_97s9i,faisent,"NTA - you've given good business for years, and one punk employee wants to mess that up. He's either an idiot causing an issue because he doesn't know any better, or he's a petty tyrant (and from your description the latter). Some people literally can't have any measure of power at all. He feels like our Orange in Charge."
3,aw1a97,t2_35t18h93,uselessthrowacc,"Well I understand, I have a friend the same. So I’d say NTA, but you could’ve handled it better, is all. He still needs to grow up and handle criticism. I also applaud you for being able to look back and say you were slightly in the wrong, takes a sound mind :) (Edit: This was supposed to be in reply to your reply about info, sorry OP.)"
3,aiv7nb,t2_mk8p3,iamasecretthrowaway,"I'm really torn. I think either youre NTA or maybe you were an asshole-but-justifiable? If you feel bad for how you reacted, it never hurts to apologize and discuss the situation with the teacher. Maybe say something like ""i wanted to apologize for raising my voice the other day. I was worried, but that doesn't excuse shouting at you; it won't happen again"". But I absolutely wouldn't apologize for keeping your health private (she doesn't need to know your medical problem in front of the entire class. If she *does* need a reason, she could speak with you privately. And even then she doesn't need to know the details) or for leaving to go to the doctor. Hopefully she's a big enough person to accept your apology and apologize for her actions, too. "
3,aiv7nb,t2_1x2q50ve,JuicyPluot,NTA. the “valid reason” was that you weren’t feeling well & didn’t feel comfortable going into detail. She doesn’t have a right to know intimate medical details about you if you don’t want to share them. 
3,a9wlbm,t2_13jrqx,PeachyPesco,"NTA, you don't have to be anyone's friend you didn't want to and you didn't really blow up at anyone about it."
3,avxz68,t2_th0iuna,Lobstery_boi,"YTA, ESH, except the girlfriend. She needs to know ASAP. What if she gets pregnant with him? What if she gets stuck with this cheating piece of trash? Your friends are all shitty people for their complicity in keeping this douchebag's dirty secret. You have the opportunity to do the right thing and tell her what's been going on. Could you inform her either anonymously or as a secret between the two of you? It is *IMPERATIVE* that she finds out the truth as soon as possible."
3,avxz68,t2_2em5b6id,Vigilant1e,"Jesus Christ you are all cold, unforgiving bastards to be saying ESH. Ofc you're NTA. You haven't done anything wrong, you were *told not to say anything* and it's not particularly any of your business. You aren't obliged to say anything. Then again you have the power to save this girl a lot of heartache. After 4 years she must be considering spending her life with this guy and doubtless she would want to know about this before she commits to him."
3,avxz68,t2_10rc63x7,reddit2procrastin8,"YTA, it's is absolutely not your place to say anything. What he did was really shitty, but you going around telling people makes you just as shitty. What is the real reason to tell anyone, who has what to gain? No one, you just hurt more people. It seems like you're jealous of him (saying how your friends like him more) and want to destroy the persona he built of himself that obviously you know isn't true. How you interact with him is fine, but understand that he confided in you because he probably felt awful. People cheat for reasons and you may not really know thier relationship. I'm not giving the guy a pass, but what im saying people make mistakes and it harder to forgive than to hate. If he wants people to know, then he can tell them. Don't get involved because that makes you a truly awful person seeking to destroy someone else's life because you don't agree with it"
3,admbml,t2_15c00l,penelope_pig,"YTA. It sounds an awful lot like your wife may be depressed. And if this is how she's always been, you really don't get to complain because you knew what you were getting into. If you don't love your wife anymore and/or don't want to stay married, then get a divorce, but don't go after her sister. You will destroy their relationship, wreck your chances at having a decent co-parenting relationship with your wife, and basically it would make you a huge scumbag. Find someone else after you are no longer married."
3,admbml,t2_2atwddgm,hunnybunchesoflove,YTA. Maybe instead of shitting on your wife and wanting to go after her sister maybe help your life partner out. A drastic change in weight like that could mean she has hormonal issues or has depression. She seems to be suffering alone while you want to go fuck her sister.
3,admbml,t2_5u6of4d,Camiljr,"NTA for now since you haven't really done anything wrong, but you have 2 options here, either leave your wife and stay away from the sister, or talk to your wife and help her get her shit together because she is clearly disturbed. Nothing good will come out of this no matter what way it goes if you decide to pursue the sister."
3,b1i0tc,t2_2b56o8g8,_fuck_this_shit__,"NTA. Maybe NAH but I’ll get to that later. It sounds like you didn’t mean anything bad by what you said. You sound like you were just trying your best to be a loving and supportive spouse. He shouldn’t have reacted the way he did. It was excessive and rude. However, depression can make people say some things they don’t mean. That’s not an excuse to be a jerk or to treat people poorly, but it is an effect of depression. If he recognizes that he sometimes acts out because of his depression and is actively working to fix it, NAH. But if he doesn’t recognize that his reaction was not good and isn’t working on it, there’s a problem. Maybe try going to therapy with him sometime so that you can discuss these issues and why certain things upset him. Then you can both understand the issue better and address it together. "
3,b1i0tc,t2_2svyz9wg,ldaniellel,"NTA- if you “always” do that and he doesn’t like it, he should’ve said something sooner. It’s clear you were just trying to be supportive and sympathetic despite the fact that he wasn’t giving you a whole lot to work with. If the way you’re communicating with him isn’t working for him, he needs to speak up and communicate that to you. Depression sucks, but he needs to advocate for himself, not blame you when you’re not caring for him in the exact right way"
3,9z43x5,t2_15vx9y,impressivepineapple,"Honestly, YTA. It’s a shared car, which you now have access to almost 100% of the time. Your sister is back for what, 4-5 days? You can’t let her use it during that time? If you’re more comfortable in the car, maybe she is too. Even if she CAN drive the other cars, running errands would be more comfortable in her car. Because it is her car. It’s yours too, but you share it. So it’s partially hers. If you wanted to stay after and talk to friends, you could’ve just told her to pick you up a half hour later so you had more time. YTA for coming up with very shaky reasons not to share when you get the car for most of the time anyway. Edit: I completely missed the fact that you just got your license a week ago. I’m not going to edit my original response, but now I’d say NTA. You’re excited! I remember when I first got my license I wanted to drive everywhere. If you did this next thanksgiving/at Christmas then you’d be the asshole, but the excitement of it being new makes you definitely NTA here. "
3,9z43x5,t2_wq5w9,DMVbandz,Even though it’s a shared car I don’t see any reason for her not to be able to take the other 2 without stressing. Depending on how long you’ve had your license it would be good to learn to drive the others too though NTA 
3,ap4zff,t2_17fp6e,whatwhatwutyut,"NTA. He was ranting, you tried to calm him down. He didn't want to so you ended the conversation. I think you handled it maturely by ending the conversation instead of arguing over something that he obviously wasn't going to change his mind on."
3,as96jr,t2_15z6yu,KAbNeaco,"NTA. Oooooh, tell him your generation is the way they are cause they were all left to 'cry it out' as kids. /s But in all honesty, your dad needs to recognize that you and your wife have decided how to raise your daughter, and that advice counter to that style isn't helpful."
3,as96jr,t2_irh3f72,AimMick, NTA. I mean maybe a little harsh with the fuck off. But It seems like you’ve asked him numerous times. Maybe now he will get the hint. Also no baby on earth has been hurt by being held and cuddled too much. Keep doing you. Your baby will be fine. 
3,as96jr,t2_s3vvgeq,lurkylurkeroo,"NTA ""Dad, enough. No - stop. This is the last time I am saying this. Do not comment on our parenting again. You had your children, your time is over. This is not your child. If you criticise us again, you'll be treated like the stubborn toddler you're behaving like, and will be put in Time Out. That means you won't see B for 6 weeks. You do it again after that, I'll make it 3 months, you do it a third time, it'll be a year. Do you get the message? I've had enough. Knock it off. This conversation is over, I will not discuss it again, and I'm not interested in hearing your opinion on my ""generation"", either. We're the parents, you have no place here."" No more JADE. I'm presuming you've Justified, Argued, Defended and Explained until you're blue in the face, and it's done absolutely nothing to change his behavior. So stop doing it, and put your foot down. It stops, now, and that's the end of it, and too bad of he doesn't like it. >My mum says that he's just stubborn and set in his ways And bully for him but this is how you are and wouldn't it be fun if your mother put as much effort into changing his behavior as she does trying to change yours. Just because she enables his nonsense doesn't mean you have to."
3,a4qvsm,t2_a37qc,Outlashed,"NTA Because he had a bad past, and it sounds like he's turning around - He still needs to chip in, you're not his Charity Foundation. The guy got arrested 10 times in 2 years, it's not unfair for you, to doubt him regarding his future - Reformed or not."
3,a4qvsm,t2_lw9tl3o,Kingwryn,NTA - you can only do so much for someone. This dude needs to take a bus and get in a routine for himself then stop moochin off people. He put himself in it and he’s got to do it for himself. You have ton a ton and i think that makes you a great person but definitely NTA. 
3,ay3qov,t2_2u3wuf9y,tairo-,"NTA - I totally understand this and you have every right to get mad at her for it. It sucks to have something you work on - no matter what it is - get nearly messed up. While there are better ways to go about it, you aren’t the asshole"
3,9vrn0i,t2_zgedy7o,kalelovescats,"It's not really something that effects you since she's not your property and can make choices about her own body. You said she talked about getting tattoos, so it doesn't seem like she was hiding anything. Sorry but YTA on this one, sounds like you reacted from either your own insecurities or the need to control her."
3,9vrn0i,t2_7lkvc1g,a-little-sleepy,"YTA. You knew, she sent you a message but then you had to go and call her and convince her not to. Not for her sake but for some wanted sense of yours. She wanted one she told you that, she was about to get one and she told you that. You said no. Uhh.... What? That is exactly what you said you wouldn't do. Your own actions proved your real intentions. "
3,9vrn0i,t2_7lkvc1g,a-little-sleepy,"I'm confused the title says "",AITA for telling my girlfriend she can't get a tattoo?"" But you go on to say "" I don't want to control her, she can do what she wants with her body, I just want to know...."" YTA you said it yourself and then have tried back tracking so you don't seem like the asshole. You told your girlfriend she can't get a tattoo. You were controlling, you don't think what she wants to do with her body is as important as yours, you want to know so you can stop it. "
3,ava5fh,t2_qsbzn,tilman2015,"NTA Sister knows your views and if she wants you to raise her kids then should be making things as easy as possible for you to do so. Just the burden of raising 3 extra kids is more than I could ever expect someone to do for me. I would also only ask someone that I felt would raise them how I would like them to be raised. Either your sister thinks you will raise her children well or she doesn't. If she does, then she should respect the way you feel is best to do so and if she doesn't then she should find someone that she feels comfortable with. Although, this could be an ESH as you could just let a dying woman feel like she gets what she wants and then raise the kids however you want anyway..."
3,ava5fh,t2_16cvlk,LowRentMegazord,NTA. I'm sure all the Everyone Sucks Here people would happily volunteer to raise three children *in their own home* into an ideology that they vehemently disagreed with. Like if their sister wanted them to raise her kids as Trump supporters they would totally agree to do it. Because you're not all a bunch of hypocrites. 
3,ava5fh,t2_xljtu,Daedalus871,"NTA. You're pretty borderline with your atheistic zealotry, but I'm going to say you're not an asshole for wanting to raise children you would be responsible for how you want."
3,ava5fh,t2_25ddy3zw,IIDoggs,"NTA, I'm Christian, i believe in God but i don't think its fair for her yo judge your choice. She chose you for a reason, but holding a gun to uour head is not fair, 5 kids is not cheap. Also, How the hell do you clear 270 G combined in engineering? I need to make a move towards that. "
3,ava5fh,t2_1kfdjj5y,avocado__dip,"NTA. You shouldn't be expected to change your whole lifestyle while also doing a favor to your sister. However, I doubt her wishes are enforceable. Her kids likely won't go to the state if living relatives are alive. Also, it likely can't be monitored if you raise the kids with religion or not. I think the best move is to lie to her, let her die in peace, and raise her kids as you wish."
3,ava5fh,t2_1rlqmeir,a1337sti,"NTA - its only 10 weeks. I'd try to remain as kind as possible, bite your lip when needed. No don't budge on your offer, but only show her love and kindness during the last little bit of time she has left. &#x200B; Kill her with kindness , she'll come around. &#x200B; Also the flying spaghetti monster will probably devour your soul when you die if you don't help her.. :) "
3,ava5fh,t2_64okfqd,CNNWillBlackmailYou,"NTA The children are not your responsibility unless you agree to it. YOUR children ARE your responsibility, and you're right to want to do whatever is necessary to raise them well. If this woman flat out has said that she'd rather her kids die than live with you, then sounds like you're free and clear. She's an asshole on SO many levels. And yes, the bleeding hearts are going to cry, ""do what's right for the children!"" No. Not his job. Not his kids. His only obligation is to do what's right by HIS children, not some self-righteous asshole's children. If that's your stance, then every single one of you who have not yet fostered or adopted is an asshole. Not your circus, not your monkeys."
3,ava5fh,t2_283cy8u8,Cyberwulf81,"YTA. Why the fuck would you say this to your dying sister. Sounds like you were gonna treat your nieces like shit anyway, giving them whatever scraps were left over after you take care of your real children. Good for you for showing everyone that atheists are superior."
3,ava5fh,t2_14dfxj,should_be_writing1,"YTA. Your sister is *dying.* She’s freaked out and just wants to know that her children are going to be raised as she would raise them, which she can’t, because she is *dying.* are you seriously gonna consider letting these kids go into the foster system just because you can’t handle them going to mass or Sunday school? "
3,ava5fh,t2_23szwbd5,DeftIndifference,"YTA. Being unreligious doesn’t mean not respecting another’s right to believe whatever they want. That’s what gives Atheists (here!) a bad name. You don’t have to attack or ridicule their religion, to their face, to prove you’re “right”. Take the girls and raise them as well as you can, honoring their mother’s memory. Make the last few weeks of your sister’s life as comfortable as possible and once she passes, move forward with your family as you see fit. "
3,aun6qc,t2_mfzwh8,bobd785,"NTA. A pay it forward chain isn't meant to put a burden on anyone. It's supposed to be a nice thing to do, and it actually fulfilled its purpose in this case when it got to poor college kids who could use some extra help. You aren't obligated to pay if forward if you can't, but it would be nice if you do something like that in the future when you can afford it."
3,aun6qc,t2_1wgoxii5,DisneyBride28,"NTA I hate these chains. They totally defeat the whole purpose. People aren't paying it forward like ""someone did a good deed for me, now I'll do a random one for someone else"" but are now like social constructs and it boils down to just paying for food you didn't order. If you feel any karmic awkwardness do a random good deed for someone somewhere. It doesn't have to involve money...otherwise, no worries. "
3,a8xtll,t2_ulnz4,shhh_its_me,"YTA I'm not sure what you were thinking. was it something like ""Eh the baby doesn't care and won't remember""? The problem with that is the parents still love the baby and it's still their child it's not a sub-person because it doesn't know what's going on. You excluded one of their children intentionally. Excluding one person often feels like ""I don't like that person"" Brother is not the asshole because he didn't demand a gift your mother texted to tell you. "
3,a8xtll,t2_2j07y9lc,zemblan_king,"YTA. I feel like asshole is a strong word for this situation, because it’s not really a huge deal, but I do think it would have made sense just to buy something small for the baby. It creates an awkward situation otherwise. All in all, not an asshole necessarily, but probably a bit in the wrong in this situation. "
3,b6i6nc,t2_28qy0gmb,concealed_brainfart,"NTA. Just like you don't need to call yourself a cis-girl all the time, she doesn't need to call herself a trans-girl all the time. Sounds like she's not as happy/confident with her decision yet as she would like or pretend to be, which is only confirmed by her going off on you. In that light, it's understandable though that a nerve was struck when you brought it up but that's no reason to go off on you therefore she's a bit of an asshole. "
3,b6i6nc,t2_lrrje72,thefirstdetective,"YTA - but not on intention. You tried to help her, but she probably took it as ""your problems as a transgender don't matter"". People are sensitive about their gender and sexual identity (yeah straight people too). Just say you're sorry and that you honestly did not mean to upset her, but help her and fucked it up. Just tell her you can not really understand what she's going thru, you tried to convince her, that you see her as a woman and that you wanted her to see herself that way, since you thought it would make her more happy, so basically you made a mistake out of good intentions."
3,b6i6nc,t2_hsmto,avast2006,"Mildly YTA. I can understand why you would think what you thought. If she is constantly saying she isn't ""_enough_ like a girl,"" then sure, from your perspective it looks like adding the trans label would be distancing herself from what she says she wants to be. When she's identifying who she is, the trans label is present, front and center; when she is discussing what she feels she isn't enough like, the trans label is conspicuously absent. You're not crazy for noticing that disconnect, in the context that she is constantly talking about it from that angle. That said, however, I would suggest you don't try to counsel her on what to label herself. That's her job, not yours. She has to figure it out her labels for herself; you don't have to advise her. I don't think you would be an asshole if you told her, ""okay, I don't understand, because I'm not going through what you are. But it's not okay to swear at me over not understanding. You expect me to be civil to you, I expect the same. If you keep blasting me with profanity I'm not going to be willing to discuss it with you. If you keep accusing me of not actually being your friend, eventually I will agree with you. """
3,b41w0n,t2_m2yg6,cruisetheblues,"YTA but only because you want her to stop talking with the family. You're not wrong to feel upset about her brushing you and your family off. The conclusion you should have come to is that she's not ready for a new relationship, not that she should stop talking with them. The fact that you're now ignoring each other says that neither of you two is very invested in your relationship. But, see if counseling and/or an open and honest adult conversation about the issue would help. Maybe you two should be together and you both need some perspective."
3,b41w0n,t2_u6iy3,MayAnneEgg,"YTA. I think you need to recognize the grief she might not even herself realize she’s still processing. That said, it sounds like she has no business being in a relationship right now. Shaming her about it isn’t going to help anything either... break it off and let her process her grief."
3,arg441,t2_qim1c00,bskw_99,You’re NTA but if you’re confident then there’s no harm in taking one to ease his mind as well. Just do him the solid every now and then. It’s really not a big deal if you’re not pregnant. Sometimes people just have anxiety about these things. I certainly do. 
3,arg441,t2_zvu9plo,straight_to_10_jfc,NTA Your bf doesnt know how good he has it. Dumbass is gonna ruin a good thing. In fact... You should make him start wearing condoms to preveny any of his concerns from coming true.
3,azbqau,t2_clhlhec,WeirdImprovement,"NTA, you’re not obliged to cook for anyone else outside your family. It’s very nice of you to cook for your sons friend, but you don’t need to cook for his family. You’re not a chef or maid. You said it politely, too"

3,azbqau,t2_1g0w7dn1,mdpqu,"YTA for how you responded. You could have just said 'I dont have enough for everyone'. The father might have looked away bc he's embarrassed at not being able to give them as nice a meal but you said he was probably planning one. And what's up with the 'take out it is' comment? Just weird man. It's not wrong to just say 'I didnt make enough for unexpected guests'. Why you gotta be so weird about it? Edit: I agree that not saying anything, or just saying thank you for the compliment would have been better. Nobody asked for food, it's just assumptions by @OP."
3,azbqau,t2_2onl5t0j,run_fast-eat_ass,"Because of how you responded, YTA. You didn't need to be so judgemental about it. I get that you don't want to be consistently feeding them all but your reaction was rash and probably a little embarrassing. You didn't have to usher them out so fast."
3,azbqau,t2_266g0q78,TheAngelicKitten,"NTA. The kid said he was hungry and you responded on the fly. Idk exactly how it was said, I just know you felt like you couldn’t ignore the comment. The dad pushing it further and saying, “Not really” or whatever was kind of awkward. I get why your response was a bit awkward. What the heck were you supposed to say? Some people are telling you what you said was wrong, but not giving an alternate answer because they don’t have one. Others are telling you what you should’ve said when they have had time to think about it and don’t feel pressured. You aren’t a jerk for not feeding them. You aren’t a jerk for what you said. Even if people want to deny it, they have had many time when they didn’t know what to say! Now, I get that it made you feel awkward, but saying Chris should come over less because of that is silly. I 100% understand wanting to avoid feeling awkward. However, I’d only worry about it if it happens again. The way I was raised, what they did was really rude. Pulling the parents aside and discussing it might offend them. That could hurt their friendship. I’ve learned people aren’t very receptive to directness. Having Chris come over less doesn’t mean this will never happen again. I will say I don’t think it will though. Don’t change how much Chris comes over. Now that you have some ideas of how to respond use them next time, IF it happens. I did see some good responses. Offering a snack is a good move if you’re specific about what you have to offer. I want to add, you could just let the parents respond to the child. If I said, “I’m hungry.” My mom would probably tell me we’ll eat when we get home, and tell me to be patient. You’re not a jerk, it was just a weird situation. "
3,azbqau,t2_feoob,Phil0s0raptor,"NAH but possibly YTA. Sounds like they were being polite in complimenting you. It may have already been awkward since they are on your turf. Nobody asked to stay for dinner. You made assumptions and possibly embarrassed the family. However, it is hard to tell what really happened from your description because it is all based on what you perceived rather than any obvious bad behaviour."
3,azbqau,t2_361tvl34,BebenNicole,YTA. The family didn’t even explicitly ask for food? And now you’re punishing your sons friend for something that didn’t even happen. Your whole post smells of elitism and disdain for people poorer than you TBH. 
3,azbqau,t2_1wb4j340,8bitProtagonist,"YTA or twist my cold heart NAH. You're jumping to a LOT of conclusions, and they all have a sad ending. Maybe they wanted to see the home/family where their son is spending his time. They complimented you and your home. You make it sound like they showed up like a bunch of beggars from Oliver Twist. This happened once. You can handle it if it happens again, and I encourage you to pepper your future responses with more compassion. And don't be punitive about Chris by restricting access. You're a grown ass woman. Nobody has offended you. "
3,azbqau,t2_12ds7s,ThriftyLizzie27,YTA- For the way you responded. That was not nice at all. EDIT: Ok and now that I reread. You seriously told him his friend can't come over anymore? Seriously? Wow so you punish your son and his friend because you don't want his family coming around. Yeah you are the asshole. 
3,azbqau,t2_kyx6cnt,msbasicbitch,"NTA. I think it’s fair to feed Chris whenever he comes over to visit your son, his friend. I don’t think you should put a limit on how often Chris comes over for the sole reason you don’t want to feed him. What if they go to the park to play or elsewhere but then come home hungry? You only going to feed your kid. That said, I think it’s ridiculous the whole family expected to be fed when they showed up. I think it’s fair you turned them away. Could you say to Chris that you’re happy to feed him but that you can’t feed his whole family? Not enough food, already cooking a lot, can’t/unwilling to plan for his family etc. "
3,azbqau,t2_31vhn01b,dmbeeez,"YTA, you don't have to feed the family, but jeez, one hungry kid? If the parents show up again, I would just usher Chris right out. ""Great to see you all, bye now"". If I've got enough to feed my family healthy meals and they're not hungry, and I'm begruding a child? Yikes. "
3,azbqau,t2_362cbgi2,ebenfalz,"NTA. Still I find it a little odd that a singular event rearranges the whole situation for poor Chris. I think OP shouldn't act as if this was the new normal and now they're always in front of her house begging for food. This might have been a one time thing and Chris gets all the blame. Also, while simply ambushing OP is an asshole move, we all can see where they are coming from. How is your community dealing with poorer people? Can something be organized to help this family? "
3,azbqau,t2_1q8kike,AfternoonEnd,"I'm leaning more towards NTA, but if you really answered the way you did, then YTA. I don't really blame you, but I was once like that poor family, and you are a great person for even caring enough to feed Chris in the first place and while you had no obligation to feed the unexpected family, you could have said it in a ncier way. The ' well I'm sure your parents have a nice dinner planned' comment is kind of weird. I mean, what if the kids didn't get anything to eat that day, but you said that and they naturally hoped that it would be something nice. And the 'take-out' comment also kind of strange. I mean if the that turned his head, he could've been ashamed since he couldn't provide for his family. Either way, you did what you did. But do try not to push Chris away, he might be feeling ashamed of what happened, especially if you suddenly don't let him come over. Good luck, OP "
3,azbqau,t2_uu8a7iv,Jb2head,"NTA. My guess is that Chris probably talks about how the food you make is awesome or at least implies that he’s already eaten. And like leaving a bowl out for the neighborhood cat, the rest of his family are trying to get a piece of the action. That is VERY trashy, and rude of them. I don’t agree with the tell your son to stop having Chris over part, your home sounds like a safe place for him. But, I understand wanting to not have his family pull a guilt trip on you. "
3,azbqau,t2_2n79ojvl,rescuesquad704,YTA. His parents were out of line but don’t take that out on the kid after just one incident. Your spine is shiny enough and you got them out of there with no problem even though they were basically begging.

And he did ask you to check, meaning he was concerned of this. I think he was aware this was probably going to be an issue, and that the decision of what to do is on him now. If you want to help him out, go over and clean for him. You have the pictures, no use in letting shit get worse anyways."

3,b67ghb,t2_3e9jq95q,BB_butterfingers,YTA. Prioritize your family and if you’re so annoyed with her not inviting enough of your family then YOU should have invited them. I’m going to say 9/10 chance your wife did all the planning for this party. All the power means the ability to do and invite whoever she wants. You could have inserted yourself at any point (something she likely would have loved) and invited your side of the family. Don’t act like you couldn’t have. It would have taken five seconds on Facebook likely. 
3,b67ghb,t2_6r130ag,fwooby_pwow,"ESH. Your wife should compromise and move the time of the party if she can.

Some fat people don't mind being called fat; others do. It's a personal preference thing. The issue isn't that your wife isn't fat but you called her fat, or that she is and you offended her. The problem here is that your buddies framed the notion of fatness as an insult, i.e. chubby chaser, and you agreed with them. The problem here is that you prioritized your reputation with your friends over defending your wife, someone you presumably plan on spending your life with. "

3,ba3zvb,t2_2y17vd38,mvggiegrhee,"YTA. Holy shit. Firstly, for her weight and height, your wife is not fat. Her BMI would be on the heavier end of healthy. Plus, she’s going to the gym I’m assuming for self-improvement? I can’t help but wonder if she’s as comfortable with her weight as you think, and if maybe the fact that her husband goes around calling her fat has anything to do with it. Your friends shouldn’t be talking about her body, period, but especially not in a disparaging way. They were making fun of you for being with her.

If the customer is kind about it then whatever, just fix it. If the customers being a dick, then just wait and talk shit later. If you were a dick about it, then I'd understand why she would be mad, but she shouldn't have talked shit in front of you nonetheless. Considering how you seem to empathize with people in the job though, I highly doubt you were being rude about it. She shouldn't have said anything infront of you, so you are well in your right to complain. If she gets fired it is her fault for talking bad about a customer infront of them.

It puts me in a really uncomfortable position and I'm just an apprentice- we cool?"
3,b94tbi,t2_11igcq,apathyontheeast,"NTA. Put yourself in his shoes - would you want someone to let you know? Do try to be courteous about it, though. ""Hey, X, you're a great guy and I like having you here. It's awkward, but I wanted to let you know that your personal hygiene thing might not be working out for you. I wouldn't say anything if I didn't think you were a great guy."" Alternatively, ask the supervisor to do it. "
3,b94tbi,t2_awff2,CatherineConstance,"NTA if you say it nicely. I had a coworker once who always smelled like BO. He was kind of douchey, but not a bad guy (just sort of a white knight type but he was mostly okay) so I felt bad saying anything, but same as you, other people were talking about it behind his back. So one day he came in, and since he was the type who wanted to impress woman and liked to make sure he was being ""masculine"", I said: ""Hey X, did you just come from the gym? You smell a little sweaty! Maybe I'm just noticing it because of the close quarters in here, but if you have any deodorant you might want to throw some on!"" He did have some and put it on and that was the end of it, it wasn't a big deal at all."
3,b0kall,t2_23wzglbf,doggoshennanigans,"NTA - It seems to me that he’s trying to shame you into keeping quiet about your own opinions and wishes. This is not healthy. I’m not sure how well you two normally communicate, but this is not working. Perhaps when neither of you are eating you could sit down with him and discuss how this makes you feel. If he continues to do this, reevaluate your relationship and decide for yourself if this is a good, healthy, loving relationship/environment and if you wish to continue. Good luck, OP. I hope things work out for you."
3,b0kall,t2_1n2iefrx,bighero6shaped,"NTA you have every right to feel this way. He needs to step up and take care of a few things to keep the house a little more clean. I get it, I'm not the cleanest person but at the same time he needs to understand that a few little things would make you happy and also help around the house. To me it sounds like you guys need to sit down and have a conversation about it before it gets to both of you. Let him have some small victories such as maybe paper plates at the computer. But also give some responsibility to pick up his towel and maybe sweep the house. If he has to sweep then he might understand that things not picked up he has to pick them up to sweep."
3,b0kall,t2_u9rrbnb,Smallerbuttercup,"Lol god I hate this my fiance is the same way I give him cutlery he eats with his hands NTA, update if you find a solution"
3,b0kall,t2_482ldmk,need2know25,"YTA - who cares if he ate a pancake with his hands? If there was nothing on it it's not going to crumble or cause fingerprints. And if you are actually getting upset about a wet towel being left on the floor, you really need to lighten up a bit."
3,b5lqc1,t2_25m5e68c,bullili,"NTA She can't tell you who to be friends with. I think it would be good to distance yourself from him for a bit, especially if May will be around more"
3,b5lqc1,t2_2kqzj3jn,feedbacksandwich,"NTA. Unfortunately when couples break up for whatever reason the friends have to choose sides. It's awkward, but it's life. You didn't condone Jon's behaviour. You are supporting May and your wife at least indirectly. I don't like your comments about the gun though that is a lot A. "
3,axf0ef,t2_io85id2,whippetshuffle,"NTA - it’s shitty to bust a move and try to effectively cut the line (I’m assuming that people are paying attention and would want to take the next spot). It’s also not your job to police it, though, so you’re going to come across as an ass to a decent number of people. "
3,abyygl,t2_2d2o8f5r,AmITasshole_opinion,Wow YTA. You can sleep with whoever you want but to do that is just petty and is only going to fuel her paranoia. Gross all around. 
3,af02nn,t2_1fcjdbhq,AnarchoNAP,"YTA Trying to break people up outside of abuse is always asshole. You claim to love him, but you want to mess up his relationship. I don’t think you know what you want because if you did you wouldn’t have broken up with him. I kinda think you want what you can’t have. How can you guarantee that you’ll want to stay with him this time if he leaves his gf? "
3,af02nn,t2_1lvc81je,P_Flange,"YTA. So trashy. You had your chance and you fucked it up. Now that he's moved on and is happy, you realise you've made a mistake and want to disrupt that. Don't you deserve to be happy? Not if your happiness means disrupting the happiness of two other people like that. You're also pretty arrogant thinking he's just going to drop this girl that he's happy with for the bitch who broke his heart. You've made your bed, now you get to lie in it."
3,af02nn,t2_13imw9,Brandelyn1135,"YTA. If you have any humanity in your heart, you will leave him alone. Holy shit. PS I don’t know what kind of person, when hearing that a former boyfriend attempted suicide because of their break up thinks “I don’t know how serious his attempt was”. That is cold blooded. Edit: Typo"
3,af02nn,t2_zr7v6,RedFloodles,"YTA - you break up with him, which is no great crime. You're allowed to date/not date whoever you want. But you're an asshole if you now start playing stupid games. Actions have consequences, and the consequence of you leaving him is that he's now moved on and is happy with someone else. Also, I wouldn't be so sure he'd take you back..."
3,ay3hi1,t2_1mmrlkec,smakchat,NTA. You were polite and let him down gently a bunch of times before you yelled to leave you alone because nothing else was working. He sounds pushy and he wouldn't be so aggressive if he cared about getting yelled at. 
3,am8v5w,t2_337ka3v4,skyiaso,"NTA. Depressed or not, she explicitly stated that she makes an effort to see other friends, so there is little to no interest in hanging out. So I suggest cutting ties so it doesn't keep hurting you."
3,am8v5w,t2_xqxzr,catcog,"NTA Sara seems to have made it pretty clear that your group isn't as important as her other friends. That, reasonably so, has put you off her. It doesn't sound like this has much to do with her being depressed. You've made considerable efforts to keep the group going, but friends tend to drift apart as their lives change. This can be sad. Soon you'll have a new group of friends. Enjoy your next adventure!"
3,aputk9,t2_d3lfwgq,Jkg115,"NTA My first reaction to the title was your the a hole but context matters. You are being honest and caring. She needs to give you time to let this grow organically. Make sure she knows you care for her and that if she does, she can give you time to get there. "
3,b20eo5,t2_vrant1v,princesspeachbottom,"YTA: for describing it as “letting her buy expensive clothing” it sounds like you are holding the fact you earn the money above her head, like she is not an equal person in deciding what to do with the money you both have earned. As far as I am concerned a SAHM is just as entitled to the household money as you are. YTA for making her feel like you get to make the choice what happens to the money. You knew how she was. Although, I do agree that you two should come to a compromise, she does not need to spend that much, but if she wants to, then you need to validate her feeling on that and tell her your side also, communicate and come up with a compromise. She could feel trapped and grow resentment if you stay on this track. "
3,9v2shd,t2_vbln5,lucillebluth1213,"NTA. It's great that she's excited but it's not her shit to share. If she can't be trusted with pics/info, then don't give them to her. Also you saying that she's been depressed for awhile and this has made her really happy is a giant red flag to me that she'll say things like she *needs* the baby because the baby will make her happy/cure her depression. "
3,asy9pq,t2_8jtdwrt,yellowromancandle,"NTA, and yikes. If your friend can afford a shopping spree, she can afford to pay for her own food. Maybe have a sit down with her and ask her if there’s some financial constraints you aren’t aware of? And if she truly cannot afford to pay for food to go out, maybe start having more nights in together if the friendship is important for you to maintain. "
3,asy9pq,t2_6rj74,enna12,"NTA If she can't afford to eat out, she shouldn't be eating out OR she could tell you up front that she can't afford it. Then you all can make the decision to pay for her or not before you go out. If she's causing this much of an issue, maybe everyone should just start paying for their own stuff."
3,aj3app,t2_2fzqlw9r,MoonUnit98,"NTA. Cutting out toxic people never makes you an asshole. She sounds like she's making excuses for her kid too, and in no way was that a real apology. Sorry you're going through that. Take any distance you deem necessary. "
3,aj3app,t2_1pclp81m,bagelwithclocks,"NTA, Go for it, you don't have to have a relationship with someone if you don't want to for any reason. If you think they are toxic, go with your gut. Just because they are your sibling doesn't mean you have to have a relationship with them."
3,aej8eu,t2_2lpnthfj,theuserie,"You’re NTA, but I can understand why she thinks you are. If you knew your toddler wanted to say good night, and you kept talking to your friend on the phone instead, that would be heartbreaking. She probably thinks that you should have called back to ask her what was up/if it was something important, because your son is in her care, so any communication could potentially be about him and thus, more important than any other phone conversation. Based on the text screenshot you posted, it also sounds like she suspects you were talking with a potential romantic partner, not a friend, and that’s why it was so important that you couldn’t even call your baby. (Her possible words, not mine. LOL.) So no, you’re NTA. But she’s probably (over-)analyzing every single thing you do and say right now, and sees this situation as the first step in you moving on and away from her and the kid - whether that’s true or not. "
3,aej8eu,t2_2or3lauo,thisisatestabc123,"NTA. I doubt she even cares about the goodnight thing. She’s just weirded out that you talk to this guy so much and is using your kid to guilt you. But if you all are actually separated, it’s really none of her concern who you talk to on the phone. "
3,aej8eu,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,"NTA. I think she’s given you her reason. She thinks something is going on. Dude, I don’t think this is going to end well. I’ve been in a similar situation. Separations rarely help relationships. As you can see, in addition to whatever problems caused you to separate, you now have new problems that will further complicate matters. She’s paranoid that you’ve found someone new. Maybe she’s found someone new and is projecting. Maybe she hasn’t, but she may convince herself that you have and then find someone new herself. "
3,ao0dam,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"NTA for your feelings about his daughter, YTA for marrying him and into his family though. > I texted him when I got back saying I was so fucking exhausted I could barely stand up, could I please have one night to sleep. He texted me back saying I had to clean and pack and if I wasn’t on the 9am flight to Panama City the next morning, I will be responsible for his death. So I stayed up and did what I had to do and was on the 9am flight. Like, seriously? You married a dude who fought you about going to the hospital then guilted you like that? Dude sounds like a piece of work"
3,ao0dam,t2_32i08ho5,Zetyra,NTA BUT and this is a huge BUT... This is the person he raised her to be. If he doesn't have an issue with how she treats him then that's his prerogative. You don't have to like her or let her treat you poorly but that is his relationship with his daughter. Trying to change it will likely cause more harm than good.
3,arytq5,t2_3013caup,SillyMidOff49,"YTA Yeah...I’m not buying the: “Oh I was just on his phone for a joke” line... we all know why you were. Hence the anonymity or you’d just be posting this completely honesty on your normal account. Sounds like he was dealing with it perfectly well on his own, it’s normal for you to be taken aback by it, BUT you have no right to decide who he does and doesn’t speak to, OR to speak for him. That kind of controlling behaviour is the death of good relationships. "
3,arytq5,t2_bnwhlq5,jenvrooyen,"YTA - he was already telling her that he wasn’t interested, and wasn’t leading her on in any way. If you had an issue with him being in contact with her, you should have talked to him before taking the steps that you did."
3,arytq5,t2_qho5ono,LittleBookOfRage,YTA it's up to him who he wants to remove from his life not you. He was upfront about his situation with her and you did not need to message her at all. I would be furious if my partner did this to me.
3,arytq5,t2_94diq,AuditorTux,"**YTA** Look back at what you wrote. Some girl he knew was trying to land him (""can I be your Valentine?"" ""I'll be whatever you want me to be"" ""you seem so sad all the time"") and he kept turning her down (""""I'd rather just be friends."" ""thanks"" ""I already have someone""). And you decided yourself to block her. >He said some girl he tried being friends with but it's not working out. So I was like why? You have (Kaitlyn) and (Jessica) and all your guy friends? Why do you care if he's making new friends? He's already proven (in this case) that he has limits and he's not going to break them. He's been loyal to you when given *multiple* chances. One thing I've learned over the years - the more you make something taboo, the more people start to want that."
3,arytq5,t2_2xij40bi,tinsilprincess,"YTA. Why would you feel the need to message her and block her from your BOYFRIEND's phone when you saw that he was clearly not interested in her and was handling it very well? I never understand how you can just go through your other half's phone, especially with someone like your boyfriend (he sounds sincere, atleast in this situation). Do you not feel uncomfortable or embarrased doing so? "
3,arytq5,t2_1ufgz7nx,kapbear,"YTA I don't even understand why you're posting this. He responded great and handled it all very well. So many people wish their boyfriends would talk like this to other women. I don't even see a problem. You accidentally saw something, he explained. Just move on Jesus "
3,axyz94,t2_o8r43,mcbeenis,"NTA. Just block/ghost him if you’re really not confrontational. You don’t owe him anything. If it were me, I would tell him that I wasn’t interested pretty bluntly, but we all have our own styles. If you’re not comfortable with that, then just cease contact. "
3,9ypl3q,t2_d34kngn,ginger2020,"NTA. It sounds like your son is getting sucked into the Incel mindset. You want to stop him from going down this path by any means necessary. Don’t give him his computer back, or if you do, make sure that you block any websites that are amenable to Incel stuff (i.e, 4Chan). Get him some counseling and maybe a part time job if that starts to work. "
3,9ypl3q,t2_2h5zj2cu,PennroyalTea,"NTA. Your actions were a little harsh, and might have demonstrated dealing with anger poorly to your son....but I feel like they’re justified in a way. You don’t want him spewing hatred against women when you have a young daughter growing up beside him. You don’t want him hurting her or other women. You’re a good man and I hope you can pull him out of this stupid bullshit."
3,b6ab91,t2_axtmaip,Rainnv7,NTA - you guys are long distance and don’t really see each other. You’re not selfish for wanting to spend time with just your bf on your bday weekend. You already asked him if he could go and he said yes. Just be honest with him. Tell him you’ve had a really hard week and just want to spend time away with just him on your birthday weekend. Also say that the place you booked isn’t refundable. I’m sure he’ll understand. You planned this first before his friend came out. He can see his friend another time. 
3,auj823,t2_ktsj4,maskaddict,"YTA. You are *so* TA. First of all, you don't get to dictate how your girlfriend dresses. That's not how this works. You're not entitled to tell her what to wear or how she's allowed to style her hair or who she's allowed to be friends with, and you're not entitled to forbid her to wear certain things. You're not her fuckin' boss, dude, and you need to deal with this impulse to control her. You said you were afraid it was an ex's hoodie: What if it was? Is she not allowed to keep anything that came from any previous relationships? What about photos of her from when she was seeing someone else? Or clothes she wore while she was dated someone else? Does she have to get rid of those too? Everyone has a past, and hers isn't your property. This kind of insecurity can lead to seriously toxic relationship behaviour if you don't get it in check. Case in point: You stole something that belonged to her, something that she cares a lot about, and then lied and are continuing to lie to her about it. There's something about her that you don't like, and rather than accepting it as part of the cost of being with her or just ending it and moving on with your life, you took it upon yourself to *steal from her*, from this person you claim you care about, and then *lie to her face* about it. Yeah, you're the asshole."
3,auj823,t2_36ii445z,trullaDE,"YTA, holy shit, really and seriously and 100%. You not only stole it from her lied in her face about it, it's also something you KNOW she loves. That is one hell of a shitty thing to do. If you can't accept she and the hoody are a package deal for now, break up with her, fine, but I just can't get over the fact that you stole from and lied to your girlfriend, and are still not sure that you are an asshole for that. &#x200B;"
3,auj823,t2_17dls4,WorstCaseAquarium,YTA. If this was such a big issue for you then you could have broken up with her instead of taking something that gives her a sense of security. Leave her alone so she can be with someone who appreciates her and her blue hoodie. 
3,auj823,t2_y14h6,oohrosie,"YTA. 1000%, you took someone's comfort object away from them because you made it about you and your opinions. Give it back to her and you probably need to find a new girlfriend, considering you can't handle her not fitting your mold."
3,auj823,t2_bo6bn,darkrenown,"YTA. If you wanted her to be less dependant on a physical emotional crutch, I could maybe understand your reasoning, even if you went about it in an arse about face way, but your one reasoning is just controlling and a shitty thing to do. she was obviously attractive enough for you to be interested in her with the hoodie before you got together, so why is it an issue now? Or did you come into the relationship with a laundry list of things she should change for you?"
3,auj823,t2_j017v,G_Art33,YTA man give it back and apologize for not finding it at your house sooner. You may really like the girl but her and the blue hoodie aren’t sold separately apparently. I can relate to feeling much better about the way I’m looked at when wearing baggy clothes and if that’s her deal why would you take away her comfort? If this is a dealbreaker for you so be it but you can’t force her to not wear it.
3,am5vvx,t2_32o4hedc,ytayta,NTA Man I hate going to first birthday parties. There's no chance they'll remember it. Get a good picture of the kid covered in cake in a high chair and that's all they'll want to see in the future anyway.
3,am5vvx,t2_2n5h67l1,TritononGaming,"NTA You are throwing a party for you kid which is good. Don't let judgey pricks from the peanut gallery tell you what to do. She isn't going to remember her first birthday any way, it is not for her it is for you."
3,am5vvx,t2_iit2wre,aKamikazePilot,"NTA. The whole purpose of birthdays are to have loved ones around and celebrate the life of someone, in this case your daughter. She’s only 1 and doesn’t need a fancy venue, she doesn’t even really understand what’s going on! The family member that made that comment is an asshole though.."
3,am5vvx,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,"NTA. She's turning one and won't even remember this party. If your family wants to have a big party, they're more than welcome to foot the bill for it."
3,andd11,t2_z2ewe,mrmimster26,"Might be unpopular but I’m gonna say NTA. I fully support your boyfriend in wanting to go on a holiday; I don’t think couples need to be together 24/7. But a month is a much longer time than a guy’s weekend. I think he should’ve atleast spoken to you before saying yes, even if he would’ve said yes no matter what you thought. A month is a pretty long time to go away from your partner. Edited: With the info that it’s a trip with his father, I still think NTA. He should’ve told you beforehand but IMO you shouldn’t have a problem with him going for the holiday with his dad especially if he doesn’t do it often."
3,andd11,t2_d7k1m0q,SeaKingDragon,"NTA. He should’ve told you before committing to it. Doubtful that there was no time to discuss it with you before he had to decide, which means he doesn’t think or doesn’t care. Even if he had insisted on going he still should’ve told you before committing."
3,b5als3,t2_mqtgk,mayfleur,"YTA. Don't even joke about that stuff. This isn't a matter of being ""over sensitive"". Whether you think it's a big deal or not, even joking about shooting up your school is a dick move and of fucking course your school reacted the way they did. Considering how many school shootings occur every year, all threats need to be taken 100% seriously. "
3,a0ik2l,t2_q1b7igf,MrsMinnesota,"YTA. You never know what is going on inside someone's brain, body or home. And it's never okay to call someone names. And it can be a disease. Overeating is just as toxic and addictive as bulimia and anorexia. Your brain doesn't have the function to tell you that you're full. She could also be comfort eating or have depression or anxiety. That doesn't excuse her behaviour in teasing someone else either. "
3,axgfkm,t2_io85id2,whippetshuffle,"NTA. He was a prick and escalated it. Respect your elders- sure, but that doesn’t mean blindly respect and defer to someone who is being an absolute dickbag to a kid in a wheelchair just trying to get to school. Your neighbor sounds immature. "
3,axgfkm,t2_eqw0p,Thelonius16,"NTA. Ten minutes is a ridiculously long time to block the street. I would be secretly angry if that happened to me, but would just adjust my schedule. He is a Fucking piece of shit. Does he realize that if you move down the street a bit he’d still have to stop for the bus? It happens at the same time every day so it’s easy enough to adapt."
3,ajth1w,t2_2qb7se86,Patasmalaps,"YTA - What do you even have to gain from doing something like this? Even if you have a strong opinion about how things should be in your world, it doesn't mean that there aren't any consequences. You caused a lot of pain and drama between two people. Now they both know they can't trust you because you'll do whatever you want because of your opinions and inability to put them aside. "
3,ajth1w,t2_15x32c,Zombombaby,"YTA- it's not your business. And being pregnant sucks and it's hard af and you can die from childbirth or complications from it. Yes, they should have discussed this but ultimately, he doesn't have to go through the physical difficulties of pregnancy and birth. I think she should have told him, personally, but it's ultimately not his decision to make."
3,ajth1w,t2_9jady,LittleBigHorn22,NTA. You are friends to both people so you have equal interest in both of their lives. Her telling you this secret is a huge burden she placed on you. 
3,ajth1w,t2_1rnny1gu,Kghp11,"I’m torn between ESH and NTA. Barring fear of violence, I’m of the opinion that a man has a right to know when he’s impregnated a woman, regardless of what she plans to do.

3,aml0zy,t2_2bn9nezk,hazelchicken,"**YTA, deffinately.** You don't care enough about your friend to even give a shit that he is upset and uncomfortable. He was right to deny that you were sorry - you're NOT sorry. You didn't give a SHIT that he was upset. If you ***cared*** about your friends you wouldn't think they were stupid for being upset, even if you thought the *cause* was silly and insignificant - because their sadness is ***NOT*** ***insignificant.*** You act like laughing at people isn't as much of a big act as calling them a name. Laughing at someone says you don't care about what they think, feel or say. It's all a joke to you. I'm glad your classmates have a bit more fucking empathy... you're acting like a cartoon bully... "
3,aml0zy,t2_ibmc0,HereticalMessiah,NTA - it doesn’t seem like you did anything to upset your friend. It sounds like he had a stick up his ass and you took collateral damage from his teenage angst flaring up. If it all happened this way then absolutely NTA. Talk to your buddy though. Sounds like he may be going through some shit. 
3,adbjpu,t2_1mcui3x6,GoingOnABender,"Nta, she just cant take a joke and doesnt seem properly educated on it herself so she's being very general. Her attitude makes me think of people -20y/o. She has the 'I dont really know specifics but I feel like I get points if I defend this'"
3,av4bff,t2_7lkvc1g,a-little-sleepy,YTA your question is reversed. You were the one wanting someone else to give up their chair for your group that came in later wanting to sit together. He is not the asshole for not wanting to move and had no reason to accommodate you. Especially since you didn't even ask and just assumed he should move. 
3,b267q0,t2_2f4pqjm,Mommy5-0,"NTA I've said it before and I will say it again BIRTH IS NOT A FUCKING SPECTATOR SPORT. They can all fuck right off and get bent. When you and your wife go in to have the baby, Register as PRIVATE and make sure NOBODY is allowed to know you are there, it doesn't matter if it's the fucking Pope. Turn off all cellphones except for your picture/memory taking phone. Congratulations and I hope your wife has a safe delivery! "
3,b267q0,t2_336c54o3,TheCatWranglerX,"NTA- it’s already a stressful situation and this is what your wife wants. It’s understandable that they want to know and be there.

As someone who is pregnant myself, I have made it clear to everyone that unless you are my husband or a medical professional, you don't need to be in the room when the baby is born.

3,azvhsx,t2_7i0mw,EGOtyst,"YTA. Holding the door is a common courtesy. It's a small asshole thing, but you're kinda the asshole. I can see your point. Really I can... but it just is how it is. If it really bothers you, then take it to the extreme. Start holding the door for people that are too far behind you, and make them run a little bit so *they* don't inconvenience *you*! Get a little private chuckle and revenge on the system. "
3,azvhsx,t2_ynabolz,PickleweaselNaeNae,NTA. It's nice when someone holds the door for a person but that's more voluntary. You may be an asshole if the other person's hands are full though. That would be bad manners.

Stop being a child and just ask them to please ensure they pick it up. You're solving nothing by putting it on their doorstep. Edit: I reread it and it's not so bad that you left it in a bag.

But other than that EG is allowed to decide not to hang out with SE. SE asked why, and she got a reason: a personality clash. Just because EG didn't give her an answer she found satisfactory doesn't necessarily make EG the asshole. SE is being an asshole for not taking the hint. From the sound of it, Friends are just telling her to let the EG thing go.. and if they don't want to hang out with her, it probably has more to do with her constantly asking about EG."

My son is mildly allergic to eggs.. he'll get a rash, but it won't affect his breathing. He eats things with eggs, but refuses plain cooked eggs. He's 3, and we still respect what he wants to eat.

Without considering that an allergic shock always can occur, no matter what the reaction usually is like. She can't force your son to eat something he's allergic to.

We still avoid cooking with walnuts and hazelnuts, because he is allergic to them! People can still get messed up from eating something they're allergic to, even if it won't kill them. To make something for your son that she knew he was allergic to, and then to get pissed off when he refused to essentially poison himself, makes me absolutely livid. &#x200B;"

Because if he simply refused, I'd have him apologize but explain he didn't want to eat it because of his allergy. If he did explain that and she still tried to make him eat it, then he doesn't owe an apology. He's looking out for his health and following your instructions."

This is not to criticize your parenting or say you are being neglectful in ANY way, because you really sound like a great mom, but I can't help but feel that it would be tough for me personally to leave someone in charge of my kid after they'd tried to force them to eat something they're allergic to, even if the allergy is mild."
3,atvjvo,t2_660hh,differentimage,"NTA. Be proud of your kid for standing up to his grandmother who tried to force him to eat something he’s allergic to. That’s the best situation you can hope for, it shows he understands and is able to advocate for himself. Your mom seriously needs to check herself. What kind of abusive power struggle garbage is this?!"
3,atvjvo,t2_z3pn6,zombie_goast,NTA your mom's a bitch. Who the fuck forces a kid to eat something knowing that it will cause them great distress and then has the nerve to get pissy when he doesn't want to. Bitch.

3,atvjvo,t2_at8yi,ender_wiggin1988,"NTA, your kid was cool at first and made his case and she tried to steamroll him because her ego was hurt in front of the other kids because she went to hard assed away the outset."

I know you’re probably getting free baby sitting, but can you imagine literally any other baby sitter telling you they won’t watch your kid again until the child apologizes for refusing to eat something that the babysitter knows they’re allergic to? You would probably call the police, “my babysitter tried to poison my son!”. If it were me my mom would never see my son again, much less babysit him. "
3,atvjvo,t2_v6jbil,SeaBeeDecodesLife,"Nta, but your mother is. She’d prefer for a child to be uncomfortable for *her* mistake? That’s screwed up. Tell her that she isn’t allowed to see your son until *she* apologises to *him*—he was in the right! And he deserves to know that, and that adults can be wrong too, so he needs to stick to what Mommy tells him to do. Tell him that you’re very proud of him. Your mother needs to learn that being an adult doesn’t mean that she can push children around and do whatever she wants. "
3,atvjvo,t2_h6340,NotAnyOrdinaryPsycho,"Clearly NTA. You should prepare a meal that you know she hates and invite her over for dinner without telling her what it is. When she looks sour about your culinary choices or otherwise responds negatively to the food, tell her that she should eat in anyway since she isn’t allergic.

Edit: Skimming the comments, there's some people saying ""BuT hE wAS DISRespecTFul."" He's fucking 5. He can't properly articulate himself beyond ""I won't eat that because it'll make me sick. You can't make me."" OP's mother is a grown ass adult who should know better than to power trip on a child and then expect to be apologized to because she wasn't successful. "
3,atvjvo,t2_1rmvt5nu,Skeletoes8607,NTA. You taught your son to have his own voice when it comes to his health and body. Your mom should recognize that.

Youve literally criticized the colours of half the rooms in the house, you want to replace furniture, you hate this and that. This screams an attack on his lifestyle. You could have started with suggesting A room to repaint. Baby steps. Instead you are literally attacking the whole house at once and probably making him feel like he lives in an ugly house.

Being alone and chilling with your brother is a perfectly normal and healthy thing to do, and it seems like your husband is being really possessive over the movie thing for some reason. I'd talk to him and see if he thinks it's something that he thought you both thought was ""your special thing""."
3,b3xpkj,t2_3elqnuh7,stellalunawitchbaby,"NTA, you resolved the (minor) problem. He needs to get over it. I’m going to see that movie tonight I hope this gets resolved for you guys and you have fun on Tues! Edit: a typo"
3,b73t6k,t2_591w6,Woden888,"NTA- If it had stopped at him showing up in tears and going to you for support, that would be a different story. But the fact that he’s being and has been such a twat, I wouldn’t let him stay with my family either. That being said, I’d recommend talking with him about his attitude and all the rest. If he’s not willing to admit he’s being ridiculous, I’d say no-go on staying. Just my take though."
3,b73t6k,t2_1wnmiqic,Gabbaliciouz,NTA. You say yourself that you would lose your mind if he lived there. His actions led to this outcome he is an adult he should be able to handle it and figure out a solution. It sounds like he didn't want to listen to your advice as it wasn't what he wanted but he doesn't mind using you for somewhere to stay.
3,b73t6k,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,"NTA. It sucks that he's getting divorced, but your family comes first. He and his girlfriend are grown ups, so he can find a room somewhere else while he gets back on his feet."
3,b73t6k,t2_12cehh,ladykyleth,"NTA He could turn into the friend who will never leave. He could turn into the friend who is always in your business. He could turn into the friend who doesn’t ever leave you alone because they want to hang out and talk all the time. He could be the friend who stressed the fuck out of your already busy wife. The question is is you can have another grown ass adult show up and hang with you in your living room every night? Can you have a needy grown ass person hanging in your living room every night. Is he a talker? Guaranteed if he is, you will get tired of having him talk to fill the silence because he can’t take silence with what he’s feeling right now. Not that I’ve experienced any of this at all...."
3,b73t6k,t2_1iiytsw4,Nexus_3_,"Definitely NTA. Your friend is also being a 'askhole' and those are one of the most annoying types of people. Judging from how he suddenly found a new girlfriend after a relationship of 7 years, I'd say its possible he cheated in the first place. He has his new girlfriend and his new friends. He can stay with them. You don't owe him anything for mistakes he has made in his life. Edit: just read she lives with her parents. He can definitely ask to stay with them. "
3,b8dw7z,t2_3elqnuh7,stellalunawitchbaby,"YTA it doesn’t matter how much money someone has it’s still theirs, they’re not obligated to give you any. It sounds like your grandma just wanted to hear a solid repayment plan from you. "
3,b8dw7z,t2_a4sue,SoMuchMoreEagle,"YTA. It even sounds like she was considering helping you, but you didn't have a thought-out plan to pay them back. Maybe offer to set up a weekly payment plan and pay them back with reasonable interest. Show them you are taking it seriously and are trying to be responsible. If not, could you find a place with a roommate? "
3,afvqlc,t2_10ry1o,cbankert5,Idec if I get downvoted. NTA I hope every single person here saying YTA has this happen to them so they have to reflect on this actually having been in your shoes. Jesus.
3,afvqlc,t2_z7pk8,insideoutcollar,"NTA. It's smart of you to distance yourself from him. I feel that keeping the friendship would reopen an old chapter that you've put behind you. Yes, I know everyone here is all ""you can't control who he dates"" or ""you don't own a person"". Doesn't change the fact that it hurts and you have some feeling of betrayal. The only way I can see myself dealing with this is to cut them both out of my life."
3,afvqlc,t2_ke872zy,EarlMarshal,"NTA Yeah, I know he is also just a person and he also deserves happiness, but I would still say your friend is an asshole. I probably would be really mad at him and would struggle with my feelings. So kudos for acting like an adult. You seem to be a good person."
3,afvqlc,t2_5xaao,RiflemanLax,You're not an asshole for being a little upset- we all have feelings- but YTA if you get really pissy about it. People aren't property and can't be controlled as such. He was straight up with you about pursuing her and apparently she has some sort of feelings for him. Time to move on.
3,afvqlc,t2_23jalm8m,Duouwa,"YTA. You don’t own your ex, you can’t decide who can date her. Your mate did everything right by telling you before hand. You two broke up a year ago, so you can’t claim that it’s too soon or some shit. Why can’t your mate date her? Other than some dumb bro code, which is already stupid, what has he done wrong? Is it cause your jealous? If it is, then that’s fine, you can be as jealous as you want, but it’s pretty dumb to throw away a friendship over it. Take a step back and look at what you’re really saying. You’re basically saying, “You can’t date her cause I did it first!” Sounds pretty stupid right? That’s cause it is."
3,afvqlc,t2_5k43d,Debasers_Comics,">Am I the ass hole for being upset with my friend and wanting to distance myself from him? YTA. Who are you to tell anyone what they can and can't do?

3,b54zgt,t2_3492pg3h,53withtrollhair,"Sorry but YTA. If you show your son that you are there for him, he will realize this when he is an adult and you will be his dad. Do not let him down. I travel many hours for my daughter, sometimes up to 7 round trip. I never miss a chance to be with her."
3,a29xtv,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,NTA. Why the heck would she assume you're buying her kids gifts.. Theyre not your kids. You have no relation or obligation to them.. Maybe let your roommate know that she and her kids don't need to get YOU anything as you won't be getting them anything because you're low on cash.
3,a29xtv,t2_p6l9nk2,Herutastic,"NTA, gifts are given when you can and want, not as an obligation. Much less if you are don't have any real ties with the kids. Sounds like you are a background person in their lives. Maybe get them some candy if your roommate is being too pushy? "
3,aq2320,t2_b9ndflx,Pigeoncoup234,"EHS - sounds like this person is having some serious mental health issues. It makes sense to want to lash out, but its not the right thing to do. Try not to take all of this personally, it honestly sounds like this person is really going through something."

3,b8eufp,t2_2q288snz,MarieGotLost,"YTA - Though asshole is a strong word for this situation. Sorry you had to go through all that, but wanting your boyfriend to put his emotions aside so he can be there for you - read: have sex - sucks. Of course that’s unfortunate for you, but if one person of the two doesn’t want it, that’s it. Done. He shouldn’t apologize for it, especially since he’s in a bad place right now. That you want him to do it, even though he’s in a bad place and isn’t up for it (so force himself to do it), is astounding to me. Hope you both get through this, best of luck. "
3,b8eufp,t2_j9afo,Salt-Pile,"YTA but I feel bad saying this as I think this is actually a WIBTA question insofar as you haven't actually done the asshole thing (getting angry at him) yet. There's nothing wrong with how you feel, but it's not okay to pressure your partner into sex. There is nothing wrong with how he feels either. It will probably help for you to try and find other ways to comfort yourself so that your intimacy with your partner can be left as something for mutual pleasure/enjoyment when you are both up for it, not as a comfort blanket for you."
3,ajpvtp,t2_yj4o8,PM_TITS_OR_DONT,"NTA. Two things here: 1. Putting them IN the dryer is fine, but don't run the dryer, that can ruin some clothes. And 2.

I always ask my daughter if the TV is too loud because I don’t want to disturb the neighbors. It’s not hard to be courteous; she’s either selfish or oblivious. Our landlords have a clause in the agreement that if the neighbors can hear your TV/music it’s too loud. After three reports of loud TV/music, they’ll evict you. Maybe check with your company?"
3,ba5yf8,t2_ohv69,Dr_thri11,"NTA, he obviously placed a low value on the items and priced them accordingly. As a fan of guns myself I'm just thinking wtf on that M1 garand. You can't usually buy a beat-up hunting rifle for that. I get he might not have realized just how valuable it was, but you'd think he would knows guns are typically more expensive than that."
3,ba5yf8,t2_1gnlaf4,Repulsive_Icon,"NTA Regardless for how the neighbor acts towards you, he was selling that stuff at a yard sale. You paid the price that he asked, which was more than he thought they were worth. Due diligence is important, and if you fail to do it, then it's on you. Your neighbor likely won't be able to convince an attorney to take this case. As a friendly gesture I'd let the Uncle and Neighbor know you're willing to sell the M1 at a discount, say...75% of fair market?"
3,ba5yf8,t2_13dm9r,D20Lo,"NTA, but it's conditional. You're only not an asshole here because he's a piece of shit. If you did this to a sweet old person who didn't know how to google their antiques before selling them, you would definitely be TA. That said, I hope you have a dog. This guy seems like the type to try to get his shit back. What a piece of work."
3,ba5yf8,t2_hsmto,avast2006,"NTA - he set the prices himself, and he was openly snickering about how he was taking total advantage of the rube he was selling them to. He can hardly complain that you paid what he asked."
3,ba5yf8,t2_t0gra,Rivka333,"NTA. If he failed to check the value of antique items that he was selling, that's on him, not you. Heck, he got the money for them that he wanted-at the time he was happy about that, nothing's changed for him."
3,ba5yf8,t2_zj4m3,A_Redheads_Ramblings,NTA If he was too lazy to do his research then it's on him. You paid him the price he asked fair and above board. He can go piss in the wind if he's got seller's remorse now.
3,ba5yf8,t2_2r3dd52y,dogpilemusic,"NTA. Sounds like he was a prick beforehand anyway. Then during you purchasing the items, was still being a prick and making offhand comments of how he was ripping you off. Now it sounds like he decided to do the research himself, or his Uncle maybe realized the worth of the things he sold and suddenly they're both upset? Fuck em both. Enjoy your new items, and hopefully you can turn a profit on what you don't keep! Cheers."
3,ba5yf8,t2_bypah,ClothDiaperAddicts,"NTA. It’s on the seller to know what they’re selling. I’ve undersold before and it sucks, but it was my own fault. And that guy is a dick, so I feel even less sorry for him. "
3,ba5yf8,t2_9omsv,TheSilverNoble,"NTA It was fun and games when he thought he was ripping you off. But he's going to whine when it turns out he wasn't as smart as he thought. The worst kind of person. Maybe if he'd have been nicer, someone would have helped him out. "
3,ba5yf8,t2_jnhli,thelastestgunslinger,"NTA. You have no obligation to give him anything back. He chose the price, and sold it to you. The sign of a good deal is when both buyer and seller walk away happy. That happened. Later, he learned that he made a mistake. That isn't on you. He can take that as a lesson learned and do better pricing next time. Nothing to see here."
3,ba5yf8,t2_lj5y5,DankVapor,"YTA, very YTA. Eevryon else is like cool, you got one over on him because they are selfish, self centered vindictive fucking assholes.

3,ag4wuj,t2_1f9ckm55,emkautlh,"YTA Sounds like she just isn't interested in being close friends with you anymore. She probably doesn't realize that you ghosted her. She was just confused by not seeing you on league because deleting her is an overreaction. She didnt actually do anything to start a fight, she just doesnt want to talk. Youre just hurting yourself with a vengeful attitude. It sucks if that friendship wasnt where you wanted it to be, but now you killed it. That bridge is burnt "
3,a822ym,t2_t0gra,Rivka333,"YTA: while nobody should force you to eat food that you don't want to eat, the way that you went about avoiding it was kind of rude. You should have found some polite excuse that made it clear that you weren't saying her food was unappetizing."

You should have told him he was being a bad friend not just been mad at him for being unhappy and laying it on you too hard (he needs to back off but you should have told him you needed support vs telling him to ""man up."" Damn i hate that phrase it's so toxic) Edited for clarity "
3,aongpg,t2_6rj74,enna12,"NTA You didn't double book. Double booking is when the plans overlap. In this case, they didn't. You were going out with your friends after dinner. That's not a big deal. Sounds like the mom overreacted."
3,aolx0v,t2_2ukrm01a,bowerisme,"NTA. I want to give you a perspective that you may not have thought about. Probably the reason you see so many of these qualities from him is that he is comfortable around you. His habits are stress and anxiety releases from being over-stimulated. The fact that he does them around you shows how comfortable he is around you. You are a special friend and person to him. Congratulations on being a safe person for him. I know this doesn’t help answer your direct question, but I wanted you to know he is showing you how comfortable he is with you and that’s special. "

He could just have told you ""I'll stay up late with my friends"" and that would be ok by my standards, but it wasn't the case. Also him inviting to stay someone (I assume he knows) you are not comfortable with, without telling you or anything is something I really don't like. > he has a history of hitting on his friends’ girlfriends and just generally being creepy The big asshole here. Wtf?"
3,apfrva,t2_11iqj5,niceguyeddie182,"NTA. Sounds like he’s avoiding being straight up with you. That’s annoying, he’d rather beat around the bush then give you the respect you deserve. Who says I’ll be back in a bit and expects to pop back 4 hours later w no issue? "
3,apfrva,t2_bt3ft,numberthangold,"NTA. Your bf is shit at time management and does not respect you. However, id also say just forget about any plans to shower together when his friends are over, and just go to bed. You don't need to shower together every day. I just saw the edit about how he expects you to wait for him to shower together even when he's busy. Yep, he's the asshole. "
3,apfrva,t2_17crx6ok,MoreIsLessIsMore,"I swear I’ve read this before. Is this a repost? Also, NTA. Your bf is being inconsiderate. Set boundaries. If he won’t come in to shower, then you go shower. Lock the door at midnight and make it clear that since he wasn’t in on time, he can sleep on the couch because disturbing your sleep at 3:30am is not acceptable. "
3,atvlg3,t2_2tarj1m4,Feanorian_Maia,"NTA Crucify me for this, but it's gf > doggo. No matter if he had the dog before he knew you. Don't get me wrong. I adore dogs. But if my SO had a hard time sleeping in in bed with the dog, I'd just suck it up and train the dog to sleep in a nice dog bed instead. I know old habits die hard, but it's possible to train a dog to not sleep on the bed. look, I assume the dog can probably sleep most the day if it so pleases, but you, a person with a schedule, work/school and all the stuff a human has to do, needs that nightly sleep. If the dog is disturbing you at night, then something needs to be done. Sleep is extremely important. Talk to your bf again, he definitely needs to be more considerate here! Buying a nice, comfy dog bed is definitely a good compromise. Unless the dog is loud at night, you could even have her bed near yours, so she won't be too unsettled that her two beloved humans aren't there. Or put it in her favorite hang out place if she has one. However you do it, I'm sure there's a solution that will make everyone happy."
3,aeaa1b,t2_4at5t,Lucavious,YTA for yelling at your grandma. Come on man you have to know by escalating it that far she's only gonna get more stubborn. Just tell her you love her and you want her to take them for your sake so you don't worry.
3,ap4l26,t2_irh3f72,AimMick,NTA. But I wouldn’t make her replace them at this point. Replace them yourself and never let her use them again. And when she asks why remind her about this incident. It’s pretty shitty in her part to not replace them with the same brushes she ruined.

3,an0te6,t2_13go18,SirBlazington,"Definitely NTA, I’ll admit I’ve been one of those friends before and we intentionally wait till last min so whatever excuse we use has to be accepted and there’s “talking us out of it.” You’re definitely not the ass hole, people like them and me are. "
3,azeugy,t2_j4xgm,4_jacks,YTA. Regardless of your sisters situation you cant pick the gift and demand her to pay half without her full consent. She is an adult she may not be maturing as fast as you but she has to do it at her own pace. Seperate gifts so you can each do your own thing.
3,azeugy,t2_1kyj3rvu,Mystery_Substance,"YTA. Why do you have to share gifts? Why is you who dictates what the gift is and how much your jobless sister pays? Get your gift, and tell your sister to do the same. If you want you can combine postage but I'd wrap them separately."
3,azeugy,t2_rz5fj66,Kecir,"YTA for trying to force her to pay half. Do your own gifts and have that be it. Group gifts can be a mess, especially when you spend whatever you want and then tell the other person they owe you x amount. Either work it out ahead or go separately. "
3,avz02k,t2_2dhwv9h,sqitten,"YTA Because it wasn't about how many times you cheated, but about trying to rebuild trust. When you cheated, you broke her trust. Then when you let her believe something false, you showed you were still untrustworthy when she was trying to rebuild trust with you. I understand why you did it, and I have sympathy, but she has a point. I'm glad you got help for your substance abuse problem though. That's not easy at all, and you should be proud of yourself for that."
3,b4z7xx,t2_129eqn,22OregonJB,Nta. This is a tough one. I think the only thing you could have done was to talk with him one more time. You agreed to let him try with her which was a standup thing to do. He tried and failed. So maybe after she starts back with you after he failed why not one more convo with your buddy. Hey man we tried but this girl is all over me. Any good friend gives you his blessing and no feelings hurt.

And don't beat yourself up about how you handled it - dude wasn't just being friendly and making polite conversation - if he had been, then sure, phrasing it more gently would have been better.

And by the way, I’m a veteran spinner and spinning instructor and nothing bothers me more than people trying to chat with me during any workout, but especially spinning.

3,almfgo,t2_2hhlzm4n,RadioSupply,"NTA. Maybe you could have handled it with perfect poise and decorum, but who needs that when you’re doing high intensity? And if he’s not your trainer, your workout isn’t his business whatsoever. It’s totally fine to ask or tell a stranger to stop talking to you if you don’t want to be bothered. "
3,almfgo,t2_21ci7nx,nokittythatsmypie,"NTA that guy sounds like a dick. He was talking down to you about your effort level. And not taking to someone while they are working out is a rule. He doesn’t get to make his own personal rules, useless he owns the gym. Fuck that guy. "
3,almfgo,t2_x6cdp1k,SquirrelGirlVA,"NTA. There's nothing wrong with talking to people, but there are certain unsaid rules of decorum that go into any conversation at a gym. The first is that if it's clear that the other person doesn't want to talk to you, you don't bother them. The second is that when you talk to them, be polite - don't start up with criticizing their workout. Give advice, be friendly, but don't start with critiquing them as that's something you want to make sure they want. Finally, if the person says that they don't want to talk to you, don't take it personally and don't be an asshole about it. I think you handled this fine. You'd made it fairly clear that you weren't in the mood to talk from the get-go. OP, I'm guessing that you're probably female and that this was his way of trying to hit on you and at the very least, when you weren't going to roll over and let him do whatever he wanted conversation-wise, he went all ""nice guy"" on you. Some people seem to think that women owe them conversation. "
3,almfgo,t2_iqm2veg,Box-o-bees,"NTA, He was either trying to be an asshat, or in his own weird way trying to motivate you. Either way he was out of line.

3,almfgo,t2_2omfzwvr,arlomilano,"NTA. You explained you were trying your best and he kept heckling. At the end of it, it was more of a last straw kind of thing.

3,9v8uty,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"NTA. What is he 14? He wants to name your baby the Japanese word for cat? You are better off split up because he is very stupid and that kid would be teased horribly. Be 100% honest, he must be joking or a moron. My condolences being stuck with that guy for 18 years."
3,9v8uty,t2_zmjh74j,Bangbangsmashsmash,"NTA, you guys have to agree to a name, and that is an absolutely horrible name. Baby dad can pick the name, but mom has power of veto because it’s your kid too and you’re going to have to call this name for the rest of your life."
3,9v8uty,t2_1k9wguqv,sketchnscribble,"Wow, naming a child after an animal in another language? Seriously? That is stupid! Explain to him how stupid it will be when the kid grows up and if they decide to go to Japan and someone tells him that his name is cat. If he wants to pick a name from an anime, make him pick something that doesn't sound like a toddler picked it out from a Japanese vocab flash card from random. There are plenty of good names from anime. Edward (Full Metal Alchemist) , Roy (Full Metal Alchemist), Alexander (Fate Zero), Eren (Attack on Titan), or even Ace (One Piece). These are all good, decent names. Give him these names and make him pick one. You are still giving him a chance to choose, just limiting the field. NTA"
3,9v8uty,t2_jpqpc,realhorrorsh0w,"NTA. Now is the time to start worrying more about your kid's welfare than this man's feelings, even if he is the dad. And the kid will not fare well with a ridiculous name. Make sure the dad understands where you're coming from when you tell him that name is off limits. If he really wants to call the kid Neko, it can be a nickname."
3,9v8uty,t2_im97r,paprikashi,"My ex and I split while I was pregnant, and I’ve done my best to be civil. There will be many battles to fight in the years to come, and many things you will need to let slide even though it kills you, just to keep the peace. Don’t let this one slide. I don’t care if you ‘already agreed’ he could pick the name, go back on it. My ex’s ideas for names were fucking terrible, and I’m so, SO glad I held my ground. Don’t let him name that baby Neko or Chitty Chitty Bang Bang or whatever nonsense he comes up with. Say that you’ve changed your mind, and think it’s best if you both agree on both names. In a worst case scenario, ask r/legaladvice to see what your rights are - don’t name your kid something you don’t like, too. NTA"
3,b013kq,t2_231p3p6b,sfle05,NTA. His desire for affection isn't the issue; it's the fact that he refuses to honor your wishes and respect your boundaries. All of the requests you've listed are more than reasonable. When you ask him for space and he ignores you or tries to make you feel guilty he's basically telling you his wants and feelings are more important than yours.
3,b013kq,t2_xs4exno,boredattheairport69,NTA this guy isn’t compatible with you and guilts you to stay with him? Not a healthy relationship. “Breaking someone’s heart one more time” is totally worth it if If makes your life better. Don’t waste your life on someone you pity. You deserve better. Break up and remember the next guy needs to be better. Everyone deserves better!
3,ay29oa,t2_avio6,mivhax,NTA. Your fiancee is acting like a child honestly. She shouldn't have to rely on you all the time for a ride (especially when there's already someone else who can take her) or clean up her room. 
3,a341w7,t2_munzn,GbMaxSE,"NTA - It sounds like you've made yourself clear and that the BF is unwilling to Accommodate. That's a real bummer. You have a right to want no animals in a bed you sleep in every night, but it sounds like bf is having a tough time dealing with it. This needs to dealt with in some form of permanence or its going to be a constant fight. One of you is going to have to give in here."
3,a341w7,t2_16j18vp,HawaiiHungBro,"NTA, and I feel your pain. I'm not a dog person either (they're fine but I'd rather do without) and I just got a place with my bf and his dog, who he used to let sleep on the bed. She sheds like a motherfucker and hair is constantly everywhere. I hate it. But I don't let her on the bed anymore either, and my bf knows if he lets her on I will flip my shit."
3,a341w7,t2_50suk2j,ErrantJune,"NTA. My partner & I are in the same boat. It really grosses my partner out to have dogs in the bed, and it's literally the least I can do to let the dogs sleep on their beds on the floor (which they really don't mind at all). You better believe I let the dogs in the bed when my partner's not there, though."
3,a341w7,t2_ccbui,SnausageFest,"NTA. I love my dog, but that beast has her own bed. If a 70lb human was living in my home, I wouldn't be like ""yes, join us in our bed made for two people, that clearly makes more sense then getting you your own damn bed."" "
3,a341w7,t2_tkgkv79,illy7681,"NTA Your bf is an asshole. We both know he knew how you felt. Honestly, I would have refused to move in with him if I had another choice. I have four cats. Sometimes they sleep on my bed. But you better believe I lint-roll/wash the bedding if I'm having someone over. (Obviously I do a normal amount of that anyway, I just mean I take extra measures.) But, you definitely should have been more clear about this, because we all know you knew he wanted to have they stay sleeping in the bed. You were 5% off from me saying ESH. "
3,a341w7,t2_477coj8,simiwood,Yta sorry it's not like the dogs just started this you knew it was going on and if you didn't what kind of relationship do you have? Stop being so selfish.
3,ba2tgk,t2_aj5h0,Shortandsweet33,"YTA. You spent more time arguing with her than just showing your receipt and moving on with your day. As if it’s such a great inconvenience. Checking receipts is standard protocol at many stores not just Walmart or Sams Club. They don’t always do it, if nobody is standing at the door or they are busy or whatever, but they can. If you don’t like it, don’t shop there."
3,ba2tgk,t2_6wlo1,Bodymaster,"NTA. I have no idea what a Walmart greeter is or if it's their job to randomly harass paying customers. But somebody asking you for a receipt is basically accusing you of theft. What a nice way to treat your customers! Unless they can prove you are a thief (CCTV, etc.) then they have no right to do that to you. I'd have told them to fuck off as well."
3,b0p1xw,t2_6a5kf,XxmsmaliciousxX,"NTA. You sent more than enough reminders for him to get his shit together. And since this wasn't his first time he should have known. He's just mad because he failed to do the one thing that would have secured him the spot. Even if he was broke, he could have asked for you to spot him until next pay or whatever."
3,b0p1xw,t2_2x3c0rmb,pepperpotin,NTA You gave him enough time. More than enough time. You gave him reminders. You chased him down for your payment. There’s no reason to bend over backwards for a person who wouldn’t stretch an inch.
3,adr3ge,t2_994jo,thiscouldbemassive,"NTA. Your sister assaulted a stranger. She's lucky she didn't get the cops called on her. If it hadn't been your boyfriend but just a neighbor, she'd probably would be in jail. If she's scared because someone exists, she needs therapy. Also she's not just a bit racist, she's a massive racist. Minor racists don't actually commit assault."
3,adr3ge,t2_1to0qqa2,MikkiTh,"NTA Your sister is and I think at this point your sister is not someone you need in your life. Your boyfriend definitely doesn't need her in his, she physically assaulted him for speaking to her. He could press charges. She wasn't scared, she was racist. Let her be racist way over there away from you. "
3,adr3ge,t2_hhmtrnn,ItsATerribleLife,"NTA Fuck her. Your BF is being incredibly kind and sacrificial trying to suck it up for the sake of your relationship with her, but you did the good thing by not forcing him to endure her further by kicking her ass out. Fuck her, shes a racist bigot, Unless you are also a racist bigot..Theres no reason to be on her side. The fact that shes crying to you parents about sides shows she's not just a racist bigot, but a childish racist bigot. Blood is not a good reason to force a relationship with an awful person, either. What matters is the bonds that are built and broken between people, not the bonds assumed from a tenuous genetic link. You're better off without this garbage in your life, Op."
3,adr3ge,t2_88j6b1n,MatterCaster,"NTA because of her complete lack of remorse and no sense of personal responsibility to the situation. Send the screenshot of the text to your parents. This proves that he didn't sneak up on her. If he had snuck up on her, then she wouldn't have had time to send that text."
3,adr3ge,t2_ezkz6,Kanburi,"NTA, especially if she were being unapologetic. That said, it would've been a better idea for you to have gone down to let her in yourself since it sounds like your sister and your boyfriend had never met before. I would've been nervous about a random stranger walking up to my car if I were her, too."
3,b7edux,t2_16cxlp,sloth_hug,"YTA. You need to shit or get off the pot. You've been together for a very long time, but still think it's appropriate to be ""oh maybe in 3-5 years..."" vague about the wedding? If you want this man in your life, commit! His dad might not ever see his son's wedding because you're continuing to string them all along."
3,a8xu19,t2_2hpp19wh,esscuchi,"NTA I was initially tempted to say YTA, but it's clear that you don't feel entitled to sex. You're just let down by the fact that your GF discussed lingerie but nothing didn't really happen. I'd say your feelings are definitely valid, and that this conflict speaks to a larger issue of having different libidos/interest in sex. "
3,b5wx1t,t2_alvca,elllkayyyemmm__,"NTA. It's also illegal. My supervisor tried telling my coworker he couldn't speak Spanish at work. Then the next week she heard him speaking french and told him it was adorable and he should speak French more often. Doesn't really equate to your situation, but it happened recently and it bugs me."
3,b8wwib,t2_10ngu3,j_bgl,"YTA. Like you said, teachers are busy. They’re doing the best they can, and they are over worked and under payed. If you want special accommodations you might have to remind them. They aren’t spending all their waking hours thinking about just you, like you are. "
3,arl1wp,t2_26kn30sl,OnTheSubjectOfWeird,"NTA. You are entitked to spend your time with whomsoever you want. I daresay you will find the time in the future to go and lunch with your mom but frankly, let her stew and feel the chill that her words,demeanour and actions have had on you. Shes an adult. She will have to deal with it. It's your choice to include her or not. "
3,b1b2i3,t2_vz4a0xc,theowitaway224,"YTA. I think her asking you to stop means it sounded like “naner naner I’m done” and made her feel pressured because she wasn’t. If you had stopped right then NAH, even leaving right then NAH potentially. But you continued to push her buttons by choice then leave. I’d be pissed. "
3,b1b2i3,t2_1715m5,TPHairyPanda,"YTA, you knew she was frustrated then why'd you keep singing to make things worse? If you had just left because you were frustrated then you'd not be the asshole, but it sounds like you wanted the fight Also, silent treatment is ""that treatment""? Please. Silent treatment is a pretty damn good coping mechanism for the short term"
3,b42d2o,t2_3a2q35e5,That-new-reddit-user,"NTA. You didn’t even invite her. She assumed she got to go, than she assumed that you would cover half her costs. That’s a lot of assumptions. Maybe your brother just wanted so bro time. Also it’s not like you planned a holiday without her. You got offered an opportunity you would not have taken if it cost you money. I think she needs to take a step back here. "
3,b42d2o,t2_1wgoxii5,DisneyBride28,"NTA was she even invited to go by your brother/you? I'm assuming she's staying for free at his place which is already saving thousands of dollars if you guys stay a couple weeks! It's weird to assume you'd pay 1/2 her trip. If this was a romantic getaway and you guys were splitting costs, sure. But to visit your brother seems a bit off to just assume you'd pick up 1/2 the bill. "
3,b0wm5q,t2_p1qid,QwertyvsDvorak,"NTA. She's allowed to ask and you're allowed to say no. If she could see through the fog of the abuse, she would recognize that the whole point of asking for your family's blessing is to make sure they think it's a good idea. You don't. No sane person would. Does she understand why you said no?"
3,b0wm5q,t2_i2tig,Finn_Finite,"NTA. Fake blessings will only make it more likely she forces herself to stay with him. But seriously, he beat her to the point of *stitches* and she wants to marry him??????"
3,b1p9n7,t2_15nc0n,Silrhyn,"NTA If you can’t, you can’t. Don’t burn out because they don’t care about you. Pro-tip : you are the only one who can work at those time because as long as they have you and can overwork you, why would they hire someone else ? Though I’m surprised no manager is available at those times. It’s stupid on their part because if you had an accident or got sick they would have no one to cover for you, but that’s their problem. "
3,b2d6fj,t2_ag2j8,mastermoebius,"NTA, and those rough days suck. As long as this isn't common for him, it's just a minor hurdle. I'm sorry you're on the blunt end of his frustration. "
3,b2d6fj,t2_13l4ik,Deadly9750,NTA. Unfortunately he had a bad day and you took the punishment for it and that's all there is too it really. A bad day does not justify him being mean to you. Also you are very generous for supporting him in his time of need like this. Try to talk through it. 
3,aj8i4a,t2_20izeepz,annizoli,"NTA She was doing you a favor, yeah, but something went wrong that shouldn't have and then she overreacted when you let out a sarcastic comment when that startled you."
3,adqtsb,t2_2y5392a5,3Dbigmac,"YTA, you said it yourself in the title. It was a stupid mistake and you aren't even positive about what happened. You found the cat, it's not dead, I'd say things worked out. Don't ruin the relationship over this. If your roommates have a history of this then you just need to find new ones that are more attentive to your petkeeping rules. "
3,b6ck00,t2_zm4j6,kashikoicat,"I'm going to say NTA, and even possible NAH, even though her behavior seems bizarre. But I think that the mature thing to do would've been to have a conversation with her about all of this before ghosting her. Of course, that goes for her, too; if she has just been trying to make you jealous, she should've expressed her feelings to you a long time ago, rather than use another person to get to you. If that wasn't the case, she was still rather tastelessly flaunting her relationship."
3,a61pcu,t2_bbjr2,maux_zaikq,"NTA — Flip the roles. If a man punched a woman in the face because she uttered the same sentence, the police would have been called. She’s an asshole for assuming that was only a conversation that could only be had by non-black people, and that going to Hebrew school made her some gatekeeper that conversation. If you were just complimenting nazis at random, you’d deserve a consequence but not a physical one. But in the context of the conversation you were having, you said something that made sense. If all you say is true, she’s the asshole not you. Stop hating yourself, but do avoid buying people who hit you drinks in the future. "
3,a61pcu,t2_x9c4oh5,Abblz,"NAH, she sounds like she was just dying to take offence, I don’t think that reaction would have been appropriate even if you had known she was Jewish. I wouldn’t beat yourself up over your response though, you took the high road, I doubt she would have hit you if she thought she’d get hit back though. I’m a girl and I’d have been so mad I’d have knocked her over the bar but of course that would only escalate things. NTA, I forgot my abbreviations."
3,al4vee,t2_13759x,Justanothergamerwife,"NTA - and your sub should not have put you in the position of either ranking your peers, lying, or telling her no. And she should know by now that the best place to get info on the awful kids is other teachers! They've got the real dirt. "
3,b0txvq,t2_jp9eeol,mab6644,"NTA. Actually it might be the best place to do it honestly. She is in a safe space and if she reacts over the top, she isn't alone where she might hurt herself. It sounds like it's much healthier for you to end it. "
3,a87wgs,t2_nj3nhm0,nicole_8951,YTA. Can't you try to get along for the sake of the kids? My mum doesn't get along with her MIL but us kids really cherish her and I would have been devastated if we weren't allowed to spend time with her growing up.
3,9wkkk0,t2_1eufcym2,UsuallyOnNosleep,"NTA. Though I do think having a lot of birthday parties is good, if you can't fit them into your schedule, you shouldn't be required to go, nevermind do exactly what she says "
3,agogpt,t2_12iwvs,Lion12341,"NTA. He's not even trying. Not a single apology, not even a half-arsed one. Even if he did apologise you're still in the right if you decide not to have any contact with him. A relationship between the two of you is possible, but that's up to your older brother to decide if he wants to apologise, and up to you if you want to forgive him in that scenario."
3,ams5jm,t2_vkzyd20,Min_sora,"NTA - He told you he'd pick you up and you planned accordingly, the game clearly isn't a particularly significant one because he only decided last minute to watch it, he's just being lazy and selfish. "
3,ams5jm,t2_cybnh,wimaine,"NTA, of course. I can't tell how much in advance he dropped this on you, but the later it was, the bigger asshole he is. Obviously you can get home via other means, but it sounds like it's going to cost some $ and be much more of a pain. The fact that his reaction when you called him out was ""STFU and GFY"" just adds to his charm. /s"
3,au2bvb,t2_152pca1,forkinjanet,NTA. What the fuck? I'm gay and if I came out to a friend and their response was to come out to me I would be glad that I made them feel comfortable enough to do so. You need new friends who aren't biphobic assholes. 
3,au2bvb,t2_1o12n7ee,natesixtwelve,NTA how are you taking the attention from him when it was a one on one conversation? who else was paying attention? Also it seems like you confided in him as way to let him know can relate to him. Sounds like he's the attention seeking asshole not you.
3,au2bvb,t2_j9082s9,SuperFreakingTired,"NTA. It’s WAY easier to come out when you know the person you’re coming out to is also lgbt. I could easily see how and why you came out to someone after they told you that they were also lgbt. Normally I would suggest bringing this up to your friend and explaining how you felt comfortable enough, but I don’t think he deserves it at this point. Especially if he turned friends against you. Coming out is hard, and for him to be greedy about it isn’t cool."
3,ba02md,t2_13j73z,Carliebeans,NTA but I think the likelihood is very high that they test you because they know you’re clean and it looks better for them if they have negative drug tests.
3,b2yb1q,t2_5j75j,poo_pon_shoo,"NTA, please know you did the right thing here! If that was my dog I'd be so thankful that you picked him up off the street and kept him safe in your home. Give that pooch lots of love while you can, and thanks for doing what you did."
3,b2yb1q,t2_ibmc0,HereticalMessiah,"NTA- you give it bacon and peanut butter and all of the pets. Because it’s a good boy and deserves all the love. That’s how you care for a puppy. Also, roll it around and wrestle with it. They love that shit. "
3,b2yb1q,t2_4uy4416,Funnywolf27,NTA you’re a good man. The dog could’ve been a stray. My friend has dog food bowls outside his house to feed strays and they always come back. You did the right thing here
3,b2yb1q,t2_2svpg6dr,ItsRebus,"NTA You done the right thing. If the dog already got out of the yard once there is nothing to stop it getting out again and getting lost or worse. You left your contact details for the owners, they should just be happy thier dog is safe. Pet the dog, take it out to the toilet every now and then, maybe even give it a treat. You'll be fine."
3,agh2j7,t2_33mtsqk,SykoSarah,"NTA, if she needed to vent so badly, she should have just gone to you herself rather than waiting for you to make an inquiry and getting angrier the longer it took for you to do it. "
3,agmhor,t2_78028,Meloetta,"YTA. Snow is alright for walking for a while, until a bunch of people walk on it and then it's compacted into slippery ice anyway. Also, if I walked out of my house and expected to not have to walk through snow because we all shovel, I won't be wearing boots and I'd be annoyed. You should all be salting though."
3,b1d5gg,t2_9enfxr0,fifivols,"NTA. Mistakes happen. I think she has a right to be annoyed, but she's definitely overreacting. If you think of breaking up over a little mistake like that, you're a little immature. My advice is whilst you may feel she's overreacting, if you care for her, just apologise and demonstrate that it was a genuine mistake. Try not to do it again. "
3,a5k48f,t2_10tayt,LadyGrey90,YTA because you seem to think you have the right to dictate both of your sex lives. He's expressed a preference for a mixture of sex and masturbation and you still want to insist on doing things your way? That's controlling and not your place.
3,a5k48f,t2_1lcxaek4,dnjscott,"Yta because it's controlling and seems like things are good for you regardless.... sometimes you do it for different reasons, like to relax. Not wanting to cut porn out entirely doesn't make you an addict, either..."
3,aiwwuu,t2_q1b7igf,MrsMinnesota,"Yta. You're just an outlet for her because she's bored in her marriage. If she were truly your soul mate then nothing would stand in her way. Regardless of your feelings there is a man somewhere who thinks the same thing you do, married this woman in good faith and doesn't expect to be cheated on. I think she's a bigger asshole but you've got a moral obligation to step back and say *Am I really going to be that person who falls in love with a cheater and contributes to breaking someone else's heart?* Edit- She has a kid?! That just makes it even worse. She might not be having sex with you but she's still cheating. "
3,asxaq6,t2_czovu,Jockobutters,INFO - this all depends on the way that you did it. If he expressed that he was uncomfortable and you kept doing it knowing it would make him uncomfortable then YTA. If you were really just making comments about the design then NTA. But if you seemed like you were really attracted to the character and were rubbing it in his face then YTA. But if you were saying how you were attracted to the character with an aim of doing some kinky shit with your bf then NTA
3,avx20b,t2_20rz7jxm,Marrsvolta,NTA as long as you are in the right lane so that way people can pass on the left. It sounds like you are and that is exactly how 2 lane freeways are designed to work. Those people are douche bags.
3,avx20b,t2_6u2o6,Jayrodtremonki,NTA. These other drivers aren't going to pay your speeding tickets or insurance premiums if you get caught. It's one thing if you were doing this in the fast lane and not allowing people to pass you on the left. That doesn't appear to be the case so you have nothing to worry about regarding who the asshole is. 
3,b64tgf,t2_7vpoz,salvu667,"NTA. Dude you pay them to clean, that’s it. It starts with a penis on the mirror but where does it end? There are a bunch more professional cleaners out there that won’t disrespect your home. "
3,b64tgf,t2_3ghnmz8e,Fuzzy-Goat,"YTA - I mean it’s just a picture of something your son already has lol and it is kind of funny. Your SO didn’t draw it? I think if it bothered you that much you should have just said “Hey, you guys accidentally forgot to clean the penis off the mirror last time.” See if it happened again. I mean this is their job and it really was a harmless joke. No need to be so sensitive about something your son sees daily when he uses the restroom. "
3,b06rs9,t2_3cqpeyx6,anxiousperson4ever,"YTA. Did you really think Alex was going to go back and get you food? And then leaving without saying a word. I understand being hangry but you turned down Kim’s offer for food and expected them to reach out to you after you ditched them. You owe them an apology, not the other way around. "
3,b06rs9,t2_16n47k,T1TpoBidprnp,"YtA. You sound like a little kid. Maybe your food was forgotten because you showed up late after the orders were taken. Instead of Alex going back a second time, why could you just order something? Then you don't say anything and just leave! I bet you don't get invited back."
3,akt1v4,t2_2p4bvrk,predictablePosts,"NTA. But kind of a jerk. She's all heartbroken and you dangle your fancy new thing in front of her. Of course she's going to be hurt. She misses you, whether she misses your relationship or not I couldn't determine, but you as a person should at least be a bit more kind to her. You kind of gloss over your conversation with her but it seems it went from ""I miss you"" to ""No I have a gf now and we're great"". Like it's true, yes, but damn it's cold man. You could have given it some more time or let her press you a bit more. But she just wanted to talk about her feelings. You decided to jump to a conclusion for her, that she can't have you anymore and thus she should get over it. Now instead of going through the natural progression of emotions following a breakup she's forced to accept this new reality and she's a bit angry about it. NTA for moving on, but you did cause your own problem here."
3,9u531o,t2_15lnqrz2,Stinkycheese8001,"Yep. YTA. He was interested in you, and you just wanted a secret hookup to get you off occasionally, and you tried to pressure him into intercourse while knowing that he didn’t want to go there. You didn’t treat him like a person with feelings. But you also feel bad and realize that you did him wrong. People do stupid shit in their first relationships, and despite the fact that you feel like 23 is comparatively ancient, it is most assuredly not. However, you really need to take a look at yourself for trying to pressure him into sex. That is bad, flat out."
3,a2gry0,t2_wq5w9,DMVbandz,NTA that’s fuckin weird. I’d let the parents know. Dude when I was 12 I was humping anything with a pulse she definitely knows that kids that age are horny as shit or she’s brain damaged 
3,aknzun,t2_2z8ge5rx,CatWanderlust,"YTA. You knew she was interested. If it was nothing more than a one or two night fling for you, you shouldn’t have done it. If you actually like this guy you should’ve talked with her first. She confided this in you and you slept with him. Kind of shitty and I’d be pretty upset if I were her. She might get over it, but you should make sure you’re the one to tell her. "
3,aknzun,t2_19ddk75z,SimplyJubilant,"YTA. Not because of ""girl code"", it has nothing to do with gender. Does your friend have a ""claim"" on this guy? Absolutely not. But you did something with no regard for her feelings and something that you know will hurt her when she finds out. So you were being a bad friend. I'd recommend sitting her down and telling her in person soon if you want any shot of salvaging the friendship. You don't owe her an apology for having sex with a guy she liked, but I think you may owe her an apology for prioritizing sex over her feelings. "
3,aknzun,t2_6ppl4,bradderz958,"YTA. Even if he is not interested in L, you should respect her feelings towards J. I think you need to be the one that tells her, if it comes from someone else it could appear that you've done it to spite her - even though from what you've wrote here, I don't think you did."
3,aknzun,t2_gitkg,pm_me_your_molars,"NTA. She's a casual friend who's had a crush for a couple of weeks. The guy is not into it. You don't get to stake a claim on someone like a plot of land in the wild west. He has a choice in the matter and he chose you, not her. She'll be justified in being hurt, but a crush is not synonymous with ownership of people's sexual activity."
3,aknzun,t2_122th8qz,xTheatreTechie,"NTA, lotta people here saying YTA, he doesn't want your mutual friend. That's apparently clear to everyone. She doesn't have a claim to him and as for ""respecting her feelings"" eh, was she supposed to respect yours when/if she banged him? That's my take. Though I've beginning to notice that I usually go against the crowd on these posts. So maybe take my judgement with a grain of salt."
3,anxzqd,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"NTA. But as a 15 year old, you may have to tough it out. Some unethical life tips to get out of it: if you're watching a movie, talk through it. Playing a game? Cheat. Poorly. Be as annoying as possible so they'll stop asking you to come down. Trip to the store? You need EVERYTHING. I went through a similar situation with my mom. She likes to get drunk and complain to adult me that ""You never let me hug you! You're never affectionate!!!"" Well, ma, you only like to hug when you're drunk and i want nothing to do with that. :') Good luck, kiddo. "
3,anxzqd,t2_y7ae3,Mr-Dr-Prof-Dankweed,"YTA But I understand where you're coming from. Your family loves you! They want to spend time with you! They enjoy doing things more if you're around, even something as insignificant as watching TV. Your sister sounds very sweet and affectionate. That can irritating, but try to be more sympathetic! She's saying she loves you, and it's not kind of you to respond by being uncomfortable. Talk to her about other ways she can show her affection."
3,axqvgx,t2_2nz782hy,JDorian0817,NTA Your coworker deserves it. Anyone microwaving tea is barbaric. If someone tried to make my tea in the microwave I would never speak to them again. Buy the fellow a kettle and tell him to do it properly next time. 
3,b582yh,t2_xseu9,AileySue,"NTA for being mad, what she did was childish and you should have talked to her about it. She can’t be spending money you don’t have on things you don’t need she needs to grow up. YTA for going off as badly as you did on her and just assuming she will do it again. "
3,b582yh,t2_2c0r6w8d,TheLoveliestKaren,"NTA. I mean, it depends on what you mean by you cracked and told her off but you sound reasonable in your post so I'm going to assume you were a reasonable amount of angry. And you should be angry. She's jeopardizing your financial security."
3,aw7rpq,t2_njd5a,princeslayer,"YTA Not for rejecting her, but for how you handled it. There's a myriad of ways you could have cut it off, but going with ""You're handicapped, it's not going to work, bye"" was pretty callous."
3,aw7rpq,t2_eqkb6,deepfield67,"Damn. I think *I'm* about to cry, too. This hurt to read. YTA and you owe that girl an appology. You can't help not being attracted to someone for whatever reason, though I don't think I understand the reason... But you handled it poorly. I do think your friend should have told you because I would feel taken aback by it if it were me and I would resent the implication that I might not want to meet her if I knew she was in a wheelchair, and by not telling you the poor girl was set up to get hurt. Just out of curiosity, why are you opposed to being with someone in a wheelchair?"
3,aw7rpq,t2_37kjnhzn,ElaiosAdonaios,"YTA Stop defending yourself. You rejected a disabled person on the basis that she was disabled, and **told her that to her face.** The fact that you don't see why that makes you an asshole, the fact that you even needed to make this post to ask, demonstrates your massive deficiencies of character. >How would we even bang? As others have said, she dodged a bullet. You're disgusting."
3,aw7rpq,t2_qjtilm0,JustAnArtist01,"ESH with more YTA for how you handled it. Don’t make someone feel they aren’t dateable for a disability or being in a wheelchair. You can just say “I’m sorry, but I don’t feel a connection” and say something nice about the time spent with them anyway. Don’t say “I don’t like you because you are in a wheelchair” type of thing. Your friend could’ve told you, but I understand why the girl you went on didn’t want that info to be told. She doesn’t want to be seen as the girl in a wheelchair. This is probably not the first time she was made to feel inadequate to date because of it. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_pbcjc,buell_ersdayoff,"NTA. What is he supposed to do people? Fucking lie? Give her some bullshit about how there's no connection or how he's not interested? Come on man. What is this shit? High School? If the girl wasn't ready to accept him not liking her because of the wheelchair, maybe, just fucking maybe, it would've been something to be upfront about. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_y091y,LeighSabio,"YTA. You don’t owe her sex or a second date or anything like that, but you do owe her tact and basic politeness. You could have just completed the date and then told her you didn’t think a relationship would work out and would rather just be friends. You didn’t have to bring the disability into it, because no is a complete sentence. “No because you’re disabled” is needlessly cruel."
3,aw7rpq,t2_zmjh74j,Bangbangsmashsmash,"YTA, you acted like a dick! Did anyone ever teach you tact?!? You could have been more polite as opposed to possibly giving this girl mental scars! Your friend is never going to hook you up with anyone again, and I bet word will get around too"
3,aw7rpq,t2_cr75r,IAmInside,"You're not an asshole for rejecting someone for being a certain way, everyone is free to have whichever preferences they want, but **YTA** since you handled the situation so poorly. Being rejected because of illness, especially permanent illness, really fucking hurts. It's something you're far too often worried about. Honestly, this is a situation where a white lie to save her feelings would've been the best choice. So yeah, this is one of those rare circumstances where you are the asshole because you didn't lie. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_2wj9a87x,littleheaterlulu,"YTA, I will say it again, and yes you are shallow. My inbox has lit up with so many stupid assholes saying it's not shallow but it is because you weren't meeting her to have sex, you weren't meeting her to have an arranged marriage, you weren't meeting her to even form a friendship necessarily, you were meeting her to have a cup of coffee. You should be able to politely drink a cup of coffee with someone in a wheelchair. It is freaking shallow that you cannot. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_2c2q3ly2,a_flying_stegosaurus,"I’m going NTA here. Could OP have handled this better? Yes. But I think its unfair to say someone is an asshole for not properly dealing with a situation that wasn’t their fault at all. The girl in the wheelchair intentionally manipulated OP by not saying shes in a wheelchair, and its her responsibility to get that out of the way before the first date. I think OP tried to be friends at first and had good intentions but she wanted to date and he didn’t; an ugly end had to come from this situation no matter what."
3,aw7rpq,t2_784jz,Bashfluff,"NTA. This woman manipulated you. Both her and her friend had to know that this would be a deal-breaker for people. That's why she hid it. What, are you supposed to be her shoulder to cry on after you call her out (not even in a mean way, but in an honest way) for that? Are you supposed to reward what she did by still going on that date with her? No, I don't think so. If I were still dating, I would have told her straight. ""You hid this from me and that's not cool. You had an idea that this would be a deal-breaker for me, but you hid it from me to get a date, and you need to learn how to treat people better."" If that hurt her feelings, yeah, that sucks, but it's also not my responsibility to date her and to try to cheer her up after she tried to lead me on like that, and I definitely wouldn't feel guilty for leaving before the date is over."
3,aw7rpq,t2_6suvr,Zenopus,"NTA. They lied. While this girl may have been sweet and funny, it does not change her apperance. If you don't like it, then you don't like it. That is not for someone else to dictate. You were thrown into a shitty situation, with no preperation. Could have been more gentle, but she is an adult woman who got rejected. The fact she is in a wheelchair should not matter. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_32g79of7,donotresusciate,"YTA. Did you tell her your entire medical history before you met her? Or a huge trauma from your life? An abusive parent? A big dark thing that has shaped much of who you are as a person? No, of course you didn’t. She doesn’t have to tell you she’s in a wheelchair. The fact that a wheelchair is an instant dealbreaker for you makes you a massive asshole. Then how you handled it, makes your arsehole bigger than the wheel on her chair. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_14xww8j1,Band1c0t,"YTA and very impolite, not because you reject her, but the way you talk to her at the end. If you don't like her, just part away, you dont need to tell her that is not going to work and insulting stuffs, the way you did is very social inappropriate, dunno if your parents teach you how to be nice to people. She must be hurt and hate her life, specially with your comment."
3,aw7rpq,t2_oc2h7,z3bru,"NTA. You were set up. I can see how your response can be seen as shitty, but what else could you have done? If the wheelchair is an issue there is no workaround, no matter how you said it, it would always be awfull for the chick. Thats why people shouldnt hide shit :/"
3,aw7rpq,t2_5i4enaj,Barbarichealer,"YTA. Not for not moving forward with her. But, cutting the date short, is kind of a dickish move. Even if you didn't see her that way, which can happen with any girl, enjoy the time that your together as friends for the night, even if u know its not going anywhere. Your friend is an ass for not mentioning it beforehand though. You could have been cooler about the whole thing, overall. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_lxaqml,Chill-BL,"NTA, Short while ago, some lady married some dude. She didn't knew the guy had a micro dick, and the guy refused the fuck, because of this. first he wanted to get married before doing it. (like it would solve something) After marrying and finally initiating, she found out. She handled it shitty, but she was lied to, as were you. so in my opinion NTA. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_39so8cww,Remarkable_Answer,"YTA. She and your friend not telling you was a dick move, agreed. But think about how her life generally is, being rejected without people even knowing her. She wanted to see if she could be liked for who she was. Again, dick move but understandable. You not wanting to be with her is also very understandable, you are not forced to overlook her disability and people are dicks if they expect you to. But you handled it all wrong. Should have been way nicer with her. I don't know if you're looking for advice, but I think you should apologize, not for not wanting her, but for being mean. I don't think you're a bad person, you were just in a situation you didn't know how to properly handle, and that's ok. Apologize, learn from it, and move on"
3,aw7rpq,t2_1ckethps,Transit-Strike,"YTA. The only reason you ditched her is because she was in a wheelchair. From what I understand, you genuinely liked texting her. But ""rejected"" her cause she was in a wheelchair. This isn't a case of ""she wasn't someone I was into. So I didn't want to date her. I feel guilty cause she's in a wheelchair"" This is a case of ""I dumped her solely cause she is in a wheelchair"""
3,aw7rpq,t2_m01zh,theoriginalj,"NTA. Surprised by all the people that think what she did was ok. She had plenty of chances before you met to send a full body pic or just tell you. It sounds like you did your best to be tactful but she brought her rejection on herself. I'd have been pissed off if I were you, and feel like I'd been baited. And if she'd just told you before hand you might have gone out with her anyway. Nobody likes to be misled."
3,aw7rpq,t2_6lzgi,Beeb294,"ESH. She should have been upfront. Somewhat understandable knowing that people are judgmental fucks, but she still should have been upfront. She and your friend are TA for that. That said, if she was a nice girl, you hit it off well enough over text, and you thought she was cute. To cut it off over that without any warning, especially considering you only talked for 48ish hours before meeting her, makes you TA. It's not like this was hidden for months or anything. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_rqnto,DisgruntledPOG,"YTA- Bro, I get it you were caught off guard and you should have been notified about it, but learn how to be tactful and have some class."
3,aw7rpq,t2_1e2krssr,bigrottentuna,"YTA. You couldn’t even be polite to the poor girl for an hour or two. She is not obligated to tell you her life story before you show up for a coffee date. If you don’t want a second date, that’s fine, but there was no reason to treat her so callously. Some day, if you are lucky, you may meet someone who will overlook your emotional handicap."
3,aw7rpq,t2_27waref5,AdrianaGaming,"YTA 100%, imo. Yeah, it's a bad reason to reject her, but there's mainly that you rejected her in such a rude way and seem to have ignored her very understand reasoning for why she didn't tell you. She may be sensitive about it overall, too. Basically, the way you behaved sounds way out of line and insensitive. Rejecting her for that would be fine, I suppose, if you truly lost most or all interest, but doing it like this? Come on, man. I hope you never behave like this again. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_33w8juh1,whiskywineandcats,"YTA. For the way you rejected her, for not accepting the judgment of YTA. And for all your justification comments to everyone saying you’re an asshole How would we bang? Seriously? Such an asshole. She didn’t realise it at the time but she dodged a bullet. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_17by7l,Terror-Error,YTA. How could you not be? Yes they were pulling the wool over your eyes but you couldn't have handled it worse. You had no reason to just run out! You were incredibly inconsiderate but I'm certain others will enjoy this vent opportunity more than I. 
3,aw7rpq,t2_eqw0p,Thelonius16,"YTA. She had a legitimate concern and you acted like a shithead. She probably should have mentioned it at some point, but it’s a minor transgression compared to your outright rejection."
3,aw7rpq,t2_3bg16ron,bebopandrocksteady88,YTA You rejected her just because you wouldn’t consider a person in a wheelchair. You are unbelievably shallow and I hope she rolled over your toe on the way out. Utter fucking bellend. 
3,aw7rpq,t2_wfbqi,NebulaSlayer,"YTA. Yeah, it caught you off guard, but would have cost you anything to be a decent human being? Talk, even if you’re not interested, and be polite and respectful of her feelings. Imagine if you were plainly told “this isn’t gonna work out because you have freckles and it’s disgusting” (shitty example but anyway) wouldn’t feel good, would it? Like you could have just been nice, and then later told her you weren’t interested in A NICE WAY. God, just from your replies it’s clear you lack empathy completely. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_1w674w47,eyeball-beesting,"YTA. Ok, so it turned out you are too shallow to see past the chair like she had hoped, that is fine- everyone has their preferences. But the way you 'noped' it out of there because she was a wheelchair user was pretty shitty. You had been talking to her and seemed to have got on really well. She is still that person and you could have had a pleasant chat and coffee with her, as you are leaving tell her that she is lovely but you don't see a relationship with her. What you did was all kinds of shitty. EDIT - spelling"
3,aw7rpq,t2_hguhx,RiotGrrr1,YTA for shitting on her like that on the date. You could have finished the conversation/date naturally and just said you weren’t interest romantically. What makes you think you handled that correctly??? 
3,aw7rpq,t2_rcmj1,Gouranga56,YTA...look. I get you were not into that. You could have been a lot more sensitive. That was harsh. Yeah she tricked ya a bit on the blind date part but you crushed her.
3,aw7rpq,t2_6u2o6,Jayrodtremonki,"YTA Not for not wanting to take things further, but for making a big deal out of it and ending things on the spot. I mean, if she was missing a hand would you have told her ""eww, gross. No thanks""? Or would you have done something with the slightest bit of tact if that was a deal breaker? And would you expect a picture of her hand before the date as full disclosure? It's not like she tricked you into marrying her or something. It was a date. You found out pretty quickly. Get over yourself. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_16cxlp,sloth_hug,"NTA, but your responses to these comments point to you being an asshole in general. She was purposely deceptive and her crying about it when you called her out doesn't make you an asshole. Sorry, tears don't mean someone has to date you. But quit arguing with people as that's not what the sub is for."
3,aw7rpq,t2_1btjiaov,Forzara,"ESH. You handled it poorly, and you can’t just spring handicaps on people. I mean, ffs, if your favorite thing in the world is hiking up mountains - I mean, come on. But you’re for sure an asshole if you just stormed out. Best way would’ve been to finish the date, and politely message saying, “Hey, it was nice talking to you. I had fun. I think you’re nice but didn’t feel any chemistry.” "
3,aw7rpq,t2_11y9dx,Burner31805,"NTA, I'm honestly blown away by the sheer number of people in this thread that seem to think the idea that a person wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone in a wheelchair makes you some kind of horrible person. OP, maybe next time be a little bit nicer about it, but please don't listen to all the self righteous people in this thread. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_2t0aoi2h,et-regina,"ESH but especially you OP. Yes this girl should really have disclosed that she was in a wheelchair beforehand, primarily for her own sake in case you turned out to be a dick about it (spoiler alert: you totally were) but also to give you a chance to process this information privately before you met her, as I imagine it was a bit of a shock and that might have negatively affected your reaction. That said: ""I think you're pretty and I've enjoyed talking to you but I don't want to date you because you're in a wheelchair"" - of course YTA, how is it even a question. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_oa0du,anime_lover713,"ESH - YTA for how you handled it, she's the TA for in a way lying to you about her disability. Cute or whatever, if you're not alright with dating wheelchair girls then that's your choice. Cuteness doesn't always change that. You did handle it poorly though. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_2wdkylaq,damagedtrash,NTA As someone whose disabled and has been in a wheelchair and had a solid relationship through it I know that having a relationship with someone with any kind of disability can be taxing. If it’s not something you think you can handle then don’t even start the relationship. OP I think you definitely made the right choice. If it’s not the kind of relationship you want you shouldn’t start it. 
3,aw7rpq,t2_1k6cm1xm,lyra_silver,"NTA I agree you didn't have tact with how you handled it, but she actively hid a HUGE part of her from you. Not wanting to go into a relationship with a disabled person isn't bad. Not everyone can deal with something like that. It's not like you're dumping a current SO because they ended up in a wheelchair, THAT would be asshole behavior. She should never have hid something like that for you and shouldn't be surprised by your reaction. She kinda deserves it, lie by omission. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_2nwg0xkq,Island_universe0,"YTA. Why do you care if she's in a wheelchair? I know people always say you're not an asshole if you don't want to date someone because you don't find them attractive, but in this case you did find hee attractive so it's really just the wheelchair. Sorry for people who don't want to admit it but yeah you're an asshole if you don't want to date someone because they're in a wheelchair, what are you worried about? Who cares?"
3,aw7rpq,t2_ypigm,ca_agent,"NTA. You spent time with her, but you didn't let her think that it was okay to deceive you or that there was a chance for something in the future. I don't know how the actual moment felt but I'll bet that she had gotten her hopes up and that's the cause of the upset. That's not your fault, that's due to both of them. "
3,9zndzt,t2_16020v,Nyhtt,"YTA, You clearly are not fine with his weight if you are too ashamed of it to bring him around your friends, so stop saying you are fine with it. Bringing up sensitive subjects just to try and hurt the other person in a argument is an asshole thing to do, it shouldn't be you vs him you should work together to solve the problem. If you really loved him it wouldn't matter what your friends think of him. I know when I'm out with my GF I don't care what anyone but her thinks of me. I'll make my self look like the biggest fool in the world just to put a small smile on her face. "
3,9zndzt,t2_f3scg,Bob_Toot,"YTA You want him to conform to a standard that you think your friends will find acceptable, because you're worried about how they'll judge YOU, not how they'll judge HIM. You even said so yourself. If he's okay with how he looks, and you're okay with it, it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. And they aren't really your friends if they are going to judge YOU on how HE looks. And there's nothing wrong with encouraging him to lose weight. You could even go to the gym with him and be motivational. But turning it into a weapon in an argument, knowing it'll make him feel bad and concede the argument to you, that's just plain disgusting and manipulative and he doesn't deserve it, nor do you deserve him. It kind of comes across like you are more in love with the way he makes you feel rather than actually being in love with him."
3,9zndzt,t2_mtnsbp8,BonnJord,"Pointing out his weight in arguments shows that to you, his weight is an embarrassment so you’re not fine with his weight. You don’t want him around your friends because of how you deceive him! YdefinitelyTA."
3,9zndzt,t2_avj2eic,jr061898,"YTA. If you really love him, why do you actively try to avoid your friends of seeing him?. Honestly, that doesn't looks like love to me. Like, I get that you don't to be judged. But that attitude doesn't seems too healthy in a relationship. Even more so, are you so sure that your friends are going to judge for that?. That he is trying as best as he can to be more fit and healthy for you, but it doesn't looks like you are at least making the effort to not be ashamed of being seeing with him. I'm honestly surprised that he is acting so fine about this. If I were in his place I would feel horrible."
3,9zndzt,t2_14ro68,moongirl12,"YTA. If you love someone, you aren't ashamed of them. He's happy with himself and you continually belittle him for his weight. If you don't change I won't be surprised if you end up single."
3,as3m0x,t2_14ln1t,cigsafter,"YTA. You probably shouldn't have done it, but your bf also didn't seem against it if all he did was smirk and shrug like you said. I get where he's coming from by not objecting publicly, as that could make him feel some type of way. I think he should've been more clear, but I also think you should've just turned down the dare. I know I'd be pissed if my bf thought it would be okay to kiss another girl because a game told him to."
3,as3m0x,t2_1lhlipy,mixed_breed101,"YTA, for trying to use alcohol as an excuse, and for cheating on your boyfriend in front of him. It doesn’t matter that it was a good friend, you still kissed another guy, all for a dare? You clearly don’t respect the relationship as much as your boyfriend. Getting another girl’s number is completely different from straight up kissing a member of the opposite sex, and I think you know that. I’m pretty sure you’re trying to rationalize what you did by including his dare to get another girl’s number, which makes you an even bigger asshole. "
3,atb3bw,t2_1vyx8226,silver_stature,"YTA. You could have phrased it better, even if it is the truth. If you’ve lived with her for the better part of a decade, I’m sure she’s feeling a ton of guilt and sadness that maybe she’s not enough or she’s done something to push you away. "
3,a1v1ph,t2_1qbgxh4c,Palerthanghosts,"NTA. That is really weird. From what I remember, though, Chad and Taylor don't kiss in HSM so it could've been worse...... At least the directors are willing to work with you and you're willing to take on a smaller role."
3,a1v1ph,t2_2gtkjui4,liptonthrowback,"NTA. You're backing out early and I'm sure there's someone else who will be happy to take the part. I would consider calming down and taking the Coach role instead, though. Not because you owe it to the directors, but because it is your last year to participate and because you'll enjoy spending time with your cast-mates."
3,axwklp,t2_9lw9odq,arunphilip,"YTA. She's your mum. It's an honest mistake. You're not hurting for the €10 if you're working, paying rent, etc. Tell your mum she's responsible for the lost shaker, so she needs to make up for it with a special meal :)"
3,aorwnz,t2_nbkvs,typicalaquarius,"YTA— it’s a medical procedure and she is the patient. While it’s a special time for both of you, her life is literally on the line. It is her decision who is in the room. "
3,aorwnz,t2_y5kn5,KyutiePie,"YTA. Not for not wanting your FIL there, but for sort of demanding that he can’t be in the room. For most hospitals, the mother’s decision of who gets to be in the room and who doesn’t is final. You can tell her that he won’t be there all you want but ultimately if she decides she wants him there, that’s what going to happen. Your wife is an adult and will be going through the pain of labour to give life to your child, if having her dad there makes her comfortable then let him be there. "
3,aorwnz,t2_punl9,forester93,"YTA, we’re about to deliver twins, I hate the idea of other people in the room, but I can’t demand anything of my wife. It’s ultimately her doing all of the work, so her opinion has more value, I accept that."
3,aorwnz,t2_tcwbi7,brandyto,"YTA. Your wife needs your support, not additional stress. Her body, her medical procedure, her call as to who is in the room. She ultimately has the legal right to have her dad in the delivery room, so what do you actually accomplish having this argument? I understand why you don’t want her father there, but you’ve made your feelings known. Your wife has decided to include her dad anyway. Continuing this argument is a no win situation that only adds stress to a very stressful time."
3,aorwnz,t2_iccjf,SykCyn,"YTA, but not a complete asshole. It's nice that you're looking out for the well-being of your wife, that's really sweet. However, I'm sure she knows about how he speaks to her and in the same way I feel about abortion, it's her body and her choice."
3,aorwnz,t2_1aw99oim,lilyandcarlos,"NTA IT is also your child. Tell your wife, that This is a very special moment for you, and you are afraid, that her fathers bring there Will destroy IT for you. Fathers have rights too. I have given birth to 2 kids, and only had my husbond with me. "
3,aorwnz,t2_16k1v8,NMPire,"NTA. It's your child together and it should be an intimate moment for both of you. If you were both fine with them being there, then whatever, but since you both aren't (and even more so since he doesn't like you) it's valid for you to not want him to be there."
3,b32ymu,t2_9u2dl,VortexMagus,"YTA It sucks that you had that kind of drama, or that you feel like she betrayed you by siding with your ex, but this is pretty normal in nasty, public breakups. Some people will take your side, some people won't, for a variety of reasons. You just gotta deal with it. On the other hand, I think we're all pretty clear that the only reason you told her parents about her relationship was to hurt her, and no other reason. In this case, YTA."
3,b32ymu,t2_27wbnxwa,hashtagimanerd,"YTA She might be too, but if she was friends with him first, your breakup may have put her in an awkward spot. So I’d say not enough info on her. But you for sure are an asshole for the fact that you did it as “revenge”. Breakups suck. And losing friends over it double sucks. But that shit happens frequently. Your intentions here were to be a dick. "
3,b32ymu,t2_35937dzv,jenski1987,YTA. You are definitely TA here but dont let it get to you too much. You are young and highschool can be tough AF. You may lose this friend but consider it a lesson learnt. I would try to stay out of others business from now on. Im sorry your friends took sides on you that sucks.
3,ak0zkc,t2_5o2dx,TheLadyEve,"YTA, that's what a tip is for. If I had been on a date and the guy did that...yeah, I wouldn't call him an asshole but I would be seriously dubious about that guy. You temporarily stressed out your server and then took up the manager's time just so you could give her a compliment....when you could have just said ""thank you for the great service"" and left a generous tip. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_j3k54fn,drunkirishfeminist,"YTA - surely this had to be another dumb validation seeking post but then I read it and no you actually managed to be the asshole in this situation! What a truly arrogant and condescending way to behave, I’m glad your date saw through it. Also the reaction you saw from the waitress wasn’t gratitude it was relief you weren’t fucking her over, she would have been grateful for a bigger tip."
3,ak0zkc,t2_amcm0,squary93,"YTA there are good ways to compliment the staff and bad ways. You chose the bad way. And not only that, your date probably took it like ""Why is he paying more attention to the waitress than me?"" And maybe she isn't as good as a listener as you believe and she gets annoyed by you continuing to talk instead of asking her stuff. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_bt3ft,numberthangold,"YTA. Jesus. Would you have made this same comment if you were out with friends or by yourself? You were clearly doing it to try to impress your date. And of course, making it seem like you were going to complain to the manager is a major asshole move. I hope this girl doesn't go out with you again. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_2oxw45vo,nepsola,"YTA on this one OP. Ughhh, blurgh! You basically sound like you were on some kind of weird power trip. It's the way you did it. Not telling the waitress why you wanted to speak to her manager, making a big show of it. All you had to do was leave a nice tip, thank HER for her great service, or if you really had to go and speak to her manager, you could have simply excused yourself as if you were going to the bathroom, then told the waitress herself that you'd like to tell her manager she did a really good job. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_28dojdf0,101kbye,"YTA- it’s like you were playing some weird psychological game where you make someone feel bad at first and then surprise them with something positive. Huge red flag. My dad is a narcissist and does this all the time. For example, he’ll tell a 7 yr old (my niece) he didn’t get them a birthday present and you can see the glee on his face as he watches the child’s face fall. Then it’s “just kidding! Here you go!” while snickering. It’s not funny, it’s cruel, and why would you want to inflict any psychological pain on someone like that? This reeks of “it’s just a prank, bro!” She’d be smart to not date you again. Also, who asks “be my girlfriend” on the third date? "
3,ak0zkc,t2_ridn7,Stinkehund1,"YTA. You could've said something like ""I'd like to compliment you on your service and let your manager know what a good job you did"", but even that would still be sorta douchey. The way you did it was a major asshole move. She didn't look happy because you complimented her, she looked happy because it turned out that you didn't have a complain about her after you behaved like you did. And you seem to think you did her some kind of favor with that, which makes it even worse. Your date was absolutely right; you are so full of yourself that you're spilling out the top, dude."
3,ak0zkc,t2_3w3z812,Originalwookie,YTA not for doing it but for how you did it that poor girl was probably terrified that you were going to say something bad because 99.99% of people only ask for the manager to bitch.
3,ak0zkc,t2_eriht,celephia,"YtA. No reason to terrify the poor girl. Nothing good EVER follows ""Let me speak to your manager."" Secondly, why oh why did you have to make such a big deal about how she was such a good server and you are such a good person for giving her such a nice compliment and doesn't your date see how you're just such a nice guy? Guy above said it best- what in the fedora tipping shit is this? "
3,ak0zkc,t2_2jexbi8i,Luciferbelle,"YTA The title is very misleading. You were already trying to win over the readers with it. I've been a waitress, this has happened to me. My manager even told me it was an asshole thing to do. Also, she's probably a ""good listener"" because you never let her speak. I've been on dates and told how much of a ""good listener"" I was. Mainly because the dude never shut up about himself or how much money he made during the entire date. Just leave a good tip, and get on with your life. I got left a $20 on a $30 tab. My manager recognized it as me doing a good job. Btw, try being the ""good listener"" for once, and shut the hell up."
3,ak0zkc,t2_i5ewt,keltsbeard,"Yeah, YTA. You probably had that server thinking she screwed up somewhere and you were fixing to have her chewed out by her manager. *I'm* an asshole and this is beyond what I'd do. Hell man, leave a bigger tip. They work for the tips, that's what they do. Their manager telling them ""That table said you were on point"" does jack shit for them. The reason she looked happy was because her manager was right there beside her, she was on the clock, and not in a place to tell you how much of a jackass you were."
3,ak0zkc,t2_1o6a3g18,SquareVehicle,YTA if only because you seem to think that good listening is a rare quality. That says an epic amount about how you see other people in your life. And of course the asshole move of making a server freak out for your amusement. You gotta work on yourself. 
3,ak0zkc,t2_1642om,Cassereddit,"YTA. The gesture may have been meant well, but you could've gone about this in so many ways without making the waitress think she'll be complained about For example tip her well and say that you would like to give the manager positive feedback about you so she can move up in life."
3,ak0zkc,t2_dhvmby,min2themax,"Oooof. Well intentioned but YTA my dude. You clearly scared the waitress into thinking she made a mistake. And the fact that you don’t get that does not reflect well on you at all. Don’t blame this girl for thinking you were indeed, the asshole. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_4tg8gns,mebetiffbeme,"YTA. If you genuinely wanted to compliment her, your execution was all wrong. When you asked to speak to her manager, and she asked if something was wrong, you should have let her know then and there that nothing was wrong. Instead, she probably went to get her manager while stressing out about what she could have possibly messed up. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_139j1o,fatlittletoad,"YTA because you wouldn't tell her why. This whole story would be different, and I guarantee your date would have reacted differently if you had said, ""Thanks so much! If your manager has a minute I'd love to let him know how happy we are with your service!"" That's it. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_1q41ufbz,PicklePuffin,"Looks like you've got the idea from the responses- your account of this makes it sound like you were trying to be impressively gracious. Telling her she did a great job would be fine. Telling the manager on the way out would be fine, in most cases. The way you did it causes stress to someone in an already very stressful job. It feels artificially magnanimous. You did sound like you wanted to be impressive. Treating service workers well is an excellent thing to do. Being ostentatious about it, ruins it."
3,ak0zkc,t2_12a0y7,LiteUpThaSkye,"YTA. Someone asking for thr manager is never a good thing, and you know that. Especially with the way you just repeated it. You probably terrified the waitress that she was going to lose her job. Next time... ""I'd like to tell your manager what an excellent job you've done"" Honestly.. If I were your date.. I probably wouldn't talk to you anymore either. Had you worded it the way I suggested, completely different story and reaction. Lesson learned I hope. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_ht5ioo3,Miimmoouuu,"Yeah, YTA big time. You stressed that poor girl out for no reason, completely ruining the entire point of the compliment. Happy that your date saw through the entire thing. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_fva633u,bonio22,"YTA. i know they weren't your intentions but you scared your waitress for life and i don't know if you left the tip \[manager won't give her a tip or anything\], your date overreacted though, but it was not enough to consider esh edit: also, i don't know if you are just talking about yourself and being annoying or if she really doesn't have anything to say about herself edit2: also, next time don't try to make a show out of it, just thank your waitress and leave a good tip, it's not like manager is going to give her a raise because of that"
3,ak0zkc,t2_pf0c0o2,rebeccavt,"YTA. If this happened as you described it, you were totally acting full of yourself and I would be kind of horrified if a guy did that on a date with me. You know how you let a waitress and her manager know that she did a great job, while not looking like an asshole in front of your date? You tip her well. That’s it. That’s literally all you have to do. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_9u7th,zoeyversustheraccoon,"YTA There are a lot of better ways to compliment good service without trying to come across as Mr. Magnanimous. You undermined the sincerity of your intentions. And the subsequent comments about not tipping extra...you're digging yourself into a deeper hole. Next time, tip 20-25%, tell the waitress she was awesome, and tell the manager the same thing on the way out the door. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_98tx6,Lv16,"I don't quite understand why your date took personal offense to it, but your approach with the waitress was certainly not the best. Keeping someone in an anxious emotional limbo is an awful thing, especially when your intention is to speak highly of them. You do your own compliment a disservice when the person feels relief more than they feel anything else. I wouldn't necessarily say YTA but, dick move."
3,ak0zkc,t2_1bl0fech,colakingpotato,NTA like what the fuck is wrong with giving a God damn compliment to the dude in charge in fact what he was doing had nothing to do with his date
3,ak0zkc,t2_wilqq,AnHan07,"I’m gonna go against the grain here, NTA. I think you could have handled the situation a little more tactfully, but overall, I appreciate what you we’re trying to do and I think it was a nice sentiment. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_4axzx,seedypete,"YTA. And if there was any doubt it’s been more than erased by your responses here. You’re a huge asshole, you were showing off for your date without caring how anxious it would make your server for no reason. She was a prop you were using to impress your date, and your date didn’t fall for it. Good for her. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_uu8a7iv,Jb2head,"YTA, I understand your intention, but reading your comments, you “don’t believe in tipping extra.” You wanted to commend the server on her great service, but not want to pay an extra tip. That makes you come across as a jack ass. Unpopular thing to do, but I don’t leave a tip for mediocre service. If the person hardly talks or barely refills our drinks, unless we ask, I do not tip, for average service, I tip about 5-10$. But I have tipped, one waiter who was a really cool guy, 25$ before. (I’m a college student so I haven’t gone to any really expensive restaurants) When I was younger my dad would tip like 40$ or something to good waitress or waiters. There’s a certain way to do it and that ain’t it. It’s just like you show your gratitude with a tip. If you were going to call the manager over and commend your waitress for their service, I feel like it’s almost mandatory to give them a decent tip as well. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_1rt29qd9,MatrixMushroom,"NTA, you wanted to tell the manager that the waitress was doing a great job, and that's not showboating. If you had just complimented the waitress, she would have to then go and basically brag to the manager to get any recognition. Sure you could've handled it a bit better, but I'm still shocked at the amount of people saying you're the asshole."
3,ak0zkc,t2_bc5l1,Ekkkoe,"Okay, reconsidered, YTA. Not to the date, but to the waitress. She's a human being who tried hard to do a good job and you treat her like she's your personal servant or something... Get off your high horse dude. In general, but especially in a fucking burger joint. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_mwkp5,paradox8493,"YTA. I would've said otherwise based on what I thought your intentions were, but after reading the other comments, at the very least you went about it in the wrong way. And apparently, ""You'd rather tell the manager she did a good job than tip a little extra."" Being cheap like that makes the comments saying you were making an intentional power play/showboating seem far more credible. Had you told the waitress, ""I'd like to tell your manager personally how fantastic our service tonight was!"" Rather than just, ""I'd like to speak to your manager."" and not even saying, ""No."" when she asked if something was wrong, then I probably wouldn't have landed on the yes side. If you aren't actually an asshole, just admit to your date you went about it wrong, and make an attempt to go back and apologize to that waitress for how you went about it. Learn from this mistake and be better moving forward. Which starts with apologizing."
3,ak0zkc,t2_6mjsm,v650,"YTA, Jez just leave a damn tip and if you have to compliment them then call the restaurant later and tell the manager or better yet if they are online and have those little surveys to fill out, then do that. No need to stress out the waitress. That's a dick move. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_2bpaooq7,EmperorJangles,"NTA. I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt that you weren't trying to stress out your server. You definitely could and should have handled giving your server feedback better, but now you know for the future."
3,ak0zkc,t2_2dzxazg,Soulless35,"YTA ~~The way op asked for the manager was kind of mean, but I don't think it's that much of a big deal.~~ The way op asked for the manager was rude and he was trying to get a negative reaction from the server. Didn't see it at first. Got it now. Edit: to the people saying ""maybe she isn't a good listener and you're just self absorbed"" and things like this. Really? Were you there? Do you know him? It's very possible the guy has been on a streak of bad dates with other people where they were all self absorbed and he feels as though he lucked out with this girl. Insane how saying ""she's a good listener"" gets turned into ""op must just talk over her and be glad she doesn't talk at all"" Edit 2: changed from not the asshole. To, you're the asshole. Had a conversation with a friendly redditor explained it to me in a way I wasn't looking at it. I agree op is the asshole, but only for the way he asked for the manager."
3,ak0zkc,t2_2ycqr7h0,GrandmaMoustache,"YTA. Have you ever heard of yelp? Go there to compliment the server. If you couldn't do that much of a simple task, maybe try doing what normal people do and give a good tip and maybe wrote how pleased you were on the receipt. Hell, most restaurants have an 800 to call to provide a survey on your service. Sounds like your potential girlfriend dodged a bullet. You said how intelligent she is. Dating you would be beneath her."
3,ak0zkc,t2_1kg3ta3w,Drivngspaghtemonster,"NTA but I can see her point. It comes off as a little pretentious, especially since the waitress asked you specifically and you held it over her head like she’d done something wrong. I’d just cop to it. Tell your date you weren’t trying to be a jerk, but you realize it came off that way. Good luck. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_i65gk,Itsalrightmeow,"YTA, remind me of my dad.. Not on a good way. Probably made the waitress have a heart attack. Just like that girl because she's pretty and let's you talk about yourself. And asking to see a manager and making a scene? Idk maybe you don't realize but you seem kinda full of yourself.."
3,ak0zkc,t2_1vpexz7b,Simply_a_nerd,"IDK what all the you're the assholes are about but NTA, you complimented her and so what if you asked to see her manager that way? In the end everyone was happy and your date was kind of being a bitch. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_2opzel9g,PeterParker72,"YTA. Not for the compliment, but for the way you handled it. There was no need to torment the waitress by asking to see the manager and refusing to say what it was regarding. She probably thought you were going to complain."
3,ak0zkc,t2_147k2f,WistfulQuiet,"YTA You scared the hell out of that waitress. Why didn't you say I'd like to tell your manager what a wonderful job you did tonight? Also do it in a normal way instead of that creepy repeating that you'd like to see the manager. Also the girl's right. It was showing off and it's not attractive. You could have done this in a less showy way. You could have written a note on the check that she did a wonderful job. You could have left her a bigger tip. Even speaking with the manager is fine, but the way you went about it was ridiculous. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_b6iaca6,Boreall,"Unpopular opinion but i gotta call NTA, sure you could have handled it better but the way it's described here, you had good intentions. I'm going on this alone since that is what you asked about. The suspense thing is not ideal but doesn't qualify as asshole. So regarding giving the compliment, i call NTA. Furthermore, saying ""Whatever i did"" is only an asshole move if you clearly know what you did, since you're not entirely certain, she should have explained, you shouldn't have to work to find out. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_13aqby,MrRibbitt,Obviously by now you should see why YTA. Sometimes it's not your intentions that count. It's how you do it. Let this be a learning experience. Leaving a good tip without saying a word goes a lot farther than what you did. And if you want to say something nice say it right to the server. And leaving a good tip when the service is just ok says even more. If you want credit for you 'good' actions you're doing it for the wrong reason. 
3,ak0zkc,t2_1roxfa,SpecialSauce92,"YTA, but only a little bit. Your intentions were good (at least I hope they weren’t to earn your dates favor) There are just better way to go about what you wanted to do. You should have told the waitress you wanted to give positive feedback so she doesn’t freak out. I’m not sure why you date thought you were trying to impress her, but I wasn’t sitting at the table, so maybe that’s the vibe you gave off"
3,ak0zkc,t2_12frgzgj,Classic-Rock-Jovi,"Sorry, but I'm gonna have to say YTA on that one. I work as a waitress, and the way you asked for the manager would've scared the absolute shit out of me, especially since she asked why and you wouldn't explain. I'm sure there were some good intentions there, but if you're going to do it that way, perhaps approach it a different way. A tip or a simple compliment to the waiter/waitress would suffice. Some others see it as a power play or whatnot, but I'm still undecided on that aspect of it."
3,ak0zkc,t2_32kfy7e3,ZeLoudGoddess,NTA Your date was the asshole. If she thought that was you showing off then she doesn’t deserve you. If someone did that while I was on a date I would be very impressed. But I’ve also worked as a waitress and it is so rare to find people who do that. Or even people who treat you like a person. If the girl you were dating thinks it’s weird to be kinda to people who do those kinds of services then she doesn’t deserve you tbh. She clearly thinks of no one but herself. She probably get jealous of the waitress too. Which would still make her an asshole. 
3,ak0zkc,t2_nfee6on,PutThatOnYourPlate,"YTA. It’s one thing if the manager comes over and you give a big compliment or if on the way out you mention to the hostess that the server was amazing so they can pass on the feedback; but to just tell your server “get the manager” ESPECIALLY when she did spill a drink on the table- that’s fucked. She was probably terrified you were going to tell the manager about it and your date probably saw that she looked uncomfortable when you told her to get the manager. If you don’t get it, then you clearly don’t deserve the “smart, funny good listener” you were on a date with. Side note: You clearly have never worked as a server so just so that you’re aware of it- people suck. They will go out of their way to complain over nothing because tons of restaurants give free food when people do that. So don’t ever just tell a server “get the manager” unless something is wrong. Asshole. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_1ntjfgvs,sydney_layne_,"YTA. You were clearly showing off to the girl no matter how much you deny it. Asking to speak to the manager (especially if she made a mistake and already felt bad about it) made her nervous and stressed that she messed up and that's not ok. Plus you clearly think you're all that and a bag of chips and I wouldn't be impressed either. You're clearly just looking for validation for what you think you know about the situation. So >pardon my french, but what the fuck? Yourself. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_2y17vd38,mvggiegrhee,"This happened to me today. Just got off work. Only when I asked if anything was wrong, this woman answered me like a normal person and said “no, everything is wonderful, I just know him and wanna say hi” because she wasn’t an asshole. You on the other hand.... YTA for sure. Why would you not answer her and just repeat yourself if you weren’t trying to make her nervous or pull some kind of weird power play? And because she had an excellent experience, my customer left an excellent tip. I’m guessing you left 15%. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_zm216uy,cmurphgarv,"NTA at all. Wtf? You paid her (the waitress) a compliment. I mean, it was a little weird not to tell the waitress why you wanted to see her manager, but I think that your date's reaction is fucking weird. Unless there is some dynamic at play here that I am missing from your description, I don't see anything wrong with what you did. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_2477xh8a,cupcakesforme,"NTA: she sounds like a bitch. I have worked in the service industry and its always good to have feedback. If shes that bent out of shape about how you worded something, move on. Good luck "
3,ak0zkc,t2_2xffqing,strawberrypockystix,"YTA. Man, if any of my friends or my SO did this, I’d never want to dine out with them again. The waitress 100% thought she was going to get into trouble, and then you made a big show of complimenting her. You could’ve just given her a compliment and then leave a big tip. A big tip would’ve made a difference to her pocketbook."
3,ak0zkc,t2_gek8car,ClarityByHilarity,YTA. It was showy. The way you repeated “I’d like to speak with your manager” when she asked if something was wrong. You were putting on a show and it gives me a really uncomfortable feeling that I’m sure your date felt too. It sounds like that wasn’t your intention but honestly it was just way too much. Cringe. Sorry dude. 
3,ak0zkc,t2_lpbcxj0,Grumpy_Roaster,YTA for being a socially inept Nice Guy who radiates neckbeard autism. The best part is the waitress smiled so he thinks she's really into him. Cringiest shit ever.
3,ak0zkc,t2_2slaa2n7,salazarthesnek,"You’re NTA for giving a compliment. YTA for how you did it. You don’t ask to see a manager. Find them or leave a compliment with the host(ess). (S)he will pass it along to your server and manager, I’m sure. Or you could leave a pretty fat tip. That’ll be far more appreciated. But just to be clear, giving someone a compliment to their boss is actually a really nice thing to do - it makes them look good but you just made yourself look like a douche in front of everyone. Oh! Also you could leave an online review mentioning her name. They check that stuff and often times a review like that will get posted in the back if it mentions someone by name."
3,ak0zkc,t2_hab3t,Pm_Me_Gifs_For_Sauce,"NTA, but it wasn't seen that you were an asshole to the waitress, it was supposedly that you were being full of yourself with the group. I think because your heart was in the right place you're NTA. Just in the future, you don't have to be so adamant about it."
3,ak0zkc,t2_2ecfhqbk,dippybippy,YTA. If you seriously wanted to complement the waitress just leave her a generous tip and say thanks for doing such a great job. Then if you want to tell the manager call the next morning when they are slow and tell him. This was a look how nice I am to the poor waitress ploy and your date picked up on it.
3,ak0zkc,t2_lpo1q,Cavsfan2014,"NTA, Idk why everyone is saying you are. You said a very nice thing about the waitress and I’m sure that made her look better to the manager. Apparently going out of your way to be nice makes you an asshole. I’d find a new girl "
3,ak0zkc,t2_3xvjp,Skiamakhos,"NTA but I think your date thought you were paying more attention to the waitress than to her, which is not cool when you're on a date. If I think the service staff are doing a good job, I'll tend towards leaving a large tip & a really good Yelp review & mention the waiter or waitress by name there. The management will see & they'll get their kudos, but it won't make a scene (even if it's a positive one) in the restaurant."
3,ak0zkc,t2_2zmcbz0s,Teddywhitetiger,"NTA, Jesus fuck, y'all gotta calm down in the responses. The way you asked for the manager was a bit weird (probably scared the waitress a bit) but giving her a compliment was a wonderful thing to do. Sounds like your date was jealous of the attention, especially since the waitress and manager had no problem with it. The rest of y'all need to chill tf out. Dude was being nice and y'all are running to burn him at the stake, Jesus Christmas."
3,ak0zkc,t2_2nz4zq5s,thewhitewallisblue,"NTA, she shouldn't have assumed you only did it to impress her - although just out of curiosity, did you? Is this something you would have done if not on a date? Next time though, if you really want to make the waitress feel good, I wouldn't let her believe you're calling the manager for something negative even for a second! I bet she was stressed out before she heard what you had to say."
3,ak0zkc,t2_dklzgmh,Bearly_Legible,NTA a lot of people on here are answering this with their own opinions but they don't seem to actually be Waiters. People told this all the time to me and it is not assholish. Complimenting a person to their manager that they did a good job is nice no matter how you decide to do it. Don't listen to all these idiots.
3,ak0zkc,t2_2bipw92d,Usual_Development,"YTA Kinda I don't know if you did it on purpose, but there were other ways to get the point across, and it could come off as a douchebag move Again, I don't know the exact context, maybe you were not trying to showboat, but it definitely could come off as such. Next time, just leave a big tip. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_14xww8j1,Band1c0t,"YTA Wow op as much as I want to support you by saying NTA, but from people perspective, it's really awkward, maybe you have good intention, but the way you deliver it is bad, dunno how old you are, but it seems you lack of common sense or social norm."
3,ak0zkc,t2_13netj,Catman419,"YTA. That could have been handled differently. One way would have been to talk to the date first, “You know, I’ve been here a couple of times, but tonight that server was amazing! I really hope the managers know how hard she works.” It would prep the date that you were going to compliment the waitress without looking too smarmy. On the other hand, you could have taken the date home, banged her, and *then* called the manager and given the compliment. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_21qxl3f5,ShadowChicken032,"I’m going with YTA. This entire situation is a lot like the people who go “not touching can’t get mad, not touching can’t get mad”. This entire situation isn’t about what great service she did but more about you being funny and cute. I’d love to know how much you tipped. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_s5gjcwu,FriscoHusky,"YTA: You kinda made a big deal out of it, dude. You should have not 1) scared the shit out of the waitress by not telling her WHY you wanted the manager and 2) not done it in front of your date, at the table. You quietly got to either the maître d’ or the waitress station and ask for the manager. Or call the next day. Doing it the way you did really sounds like “hey look at what a nice guy I am! Check me out!”. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_cjtnkbh,jadedwolfie,"YTA. I mean, when the server asked if something was wrong, that was your cue to say that you wanted to give him a compliment. By dangling the compliment by saying ""I just want to speak to your manager"", which by the way, no server wants to hear, you made yourself look like an ass."
3,ak0zkc,t2_84krsdr,throwaway3921218,"YTA for sure. Should have just thanked the waitress a couple times, left a decent tip and left. You tried to flex and it was a bad decision. Hope you didn’t blow it but you might have..."
3,ak0zkc,t2_2j3k95bf,Lr217,"NTA unless you were literally trying to be an asshole. All these people acting like you're some kind of fucking monster are just absurd. You definitely made the waitress think that she did something wrong but you aren't an asshole for that, you likely didn't any better and didn't think you were being rude. Next time just let her know why you want to talk to the manager. You are not an asshole for making a waitress stressed out for a little while. If you do it again, then maybe."
3,ak0zkc,t2_120wprko,br094,"YTA for sure. First off, click bait title for sure. But the main problem is the way you did it. You demonstrated an ego issue, and she doesn’t like you because of it. In the future, stop being so prideful. It’s not cool, it’s not funny, you need to grow up. And that’s my honest constructive criticism. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_p65y4r,SelfConfessedCreep,"I Can't decide wether to put NTA or ESH. (Sorry, I know that doesn't help the algorithm) I Wouldn't say you were being a complete a-hole, just behaving a bit weirdly and being mildly cruel. However I Don't think that warrants her response here. You had good intentions, she didn't have to stay in a mood for the rest of the night. She should have just said, 'That was a bit weird/cruel, you shouldn't do that.'"
3,ak0zkc,t2_2zld2gmk,RichieDuck,NTA cause doing nice things doesn’t mean you’re trying to impress someone always. I do nice things but not to impress people I do it to be nice. I wouldn’t date someone who gets mad about that cause that means that if you guys keep dating she’s gonna get mad at more stupid stuff cause she’s stupid so go find a different date okay
3,ak0zkc,t2_u3cqt,Kronos328,"NTA. The people here (and your date) are overreacting. You could at least tell the server that you wanted to compliment her service to her manager so that she could be at ease. It was kinda unnecessary to leave her in the dark about this, but you being an asshole because of this? No. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_zp99d,DunneyC,NTA. All the ppl calling this person an asshole are assholes. As a former server it would have been a pleasant surprise for that to happen to me. Cant believe the overwhelming consensus of ur the asshole. U did nothing wrong my friend. Cheers.
3,ak0zkc,t2_3oc6m1z,EclipsedTheSun,"NTA: you did everything right. I work in customer service and would actually like to applaud you for talking up the waitress to her manager. I know how much that probably meant to her. In terms of your date, I'm not sure what her problem is and honestly. If she's overreacting over something so small, you might just want to move on. Just my two cents."
3,ak0zkc,t2_3cu31,stromm,"Nope, NTA. No one should assume asking for the manager is only for negative feedback. Also, your date made the assumption you did that to try to impress her. Well, some people are just nice and understand that positive feedback is important. Sounds like your date is the asshole. Her reaction would have had me break off all contact with her after making sure she got home safely. You don't want that type of personality. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_1cdotn5q,Santadid911,NTA. I don’t get why everyone thinks you are? I would have felt proud if someone wanted to tell my manager that I offered great service. I’m assuming you tipped as well.... The chick kinda seems like the asshole if she just ghosts you on something like that. She can at least explain why she went all cold on you. I mean that’s how you get to know each other 
3,a6ovn3,t2_2s386578,MyOwlMerlin,"NTA. Get out as soon as you can, even if you can barely afford it. Sucks about your mom but you can't force someone into your lifeboat. Also be aware that spending long periods of time in abusive situations makes you less likely to recognize abusive situations. They can appear quite normal to someone who has lived it. In other words, be careful not to hook up with someone like your dad in the future. Abusers have many faces. "
3,9wzmtq,t2_t0gra,Rivka333,"YTA. She was an asshole too, but you were a far bigger one, as what you did was wildly disproportionate. Cutting someone off is mildly assholish, damaging their car is worse. And then you called the cops trying to get her in trouble? Could you have called the cops for someone cutting you off in line? Because that was the only thing she did. Asshole."
3,9wzmtq,t2_xzuuv7m,SteeMonkey,"I find this confusing, but basically you both edged forward, you in the actual lane, her trying to cut in, till you eventually said fuck it and rammed her car from 3 inches? I dunno mate... Maybe dont ram people but also, she is a dick for trying to cut in line. I guess you NTA, because fuck people pushing in."
3,9wzmtq,t2_17gma2,BelligerentBenny,"NTA, but why did you hit her car? You shouldn't' phrase it like that. Say you prevented her from cutting you off.

3,ainf1h,t2_318nc8pn,iatathrowaway92,"NTA, he sounds like a psychopathic, rapist creep. He had no right to touch you when you said no, even if you previously consented. And it's absolutely none of his business who you date. He can go eff right off. However, I feel like you shouldn't have stayed friends with him, told him you'd ""consider getting back together,"" and continued to flirt and fool around with him. If someone treats you that poorly, cut them out completely. You didn't need any of that toxicity in your life."
3,ainf1h,t2_5k43d,Debasers_Comics,"Since you broke up, your ex has no say in what you do with your vagina. He doesn't matter. His feelings on the subject do not matter. What he wants doesn't matter. He is immaterial. Along the same lines, your ex being friends with the BFF guy gives him no say in what BFF does with his wang. Unless they are in a committed sexual relationship, which they are not. Your ex is a manipulative bowlstreak. Cut him out of your life like you would a hangnail, and do not give him another thought. NTA."
3,b5tpf0,t2_b131f5z,Boo155,"YTA and I hope you get fired. You wasted medical professionals' time, and health care resources that could have been used on someone who was really sick. All because you're a lazy slacker."
3,anb5e3,t2_1zapwnv,cooksdontcry,"YTA If your girlfriend feels confident enough to want to show off her ass a little, especially when coming to see you, you should be flattered and be proud to walk around with her. Don’t be insecure, let her wear what she’s comfortable with and you tell her she’s beautiful "
3,anb5e3,t2_2z5ur1by,blackandwhitepaint,"YTA. ""I don't want to deal with my insecurity with the fact that other men besides myself notice you, so I'm gonna police YOU on how you dress."" This doesn't solve the problem, it only enables controlling behavior, and you'd be a better person realizing this now and nipping this kind of toxic mindset in the bud. You don't own her, and ""it will mean a lot to me if you let me emotionally guilt trip you"" is still controlling. "
3,b7qebo,t2_stmb6,halftherevolution,"NTA. This is kind of tough. It would be easier if you had the option to be honest with your parents about why you're making the decision you're making. I think it would be a bad choice for you to go to the in-state school and the out-of-state schools seem like they would be really good for you, I definitely think you should turn down the full ride school based on the info given. (As much as that sucks) &#x200B; How different are the schools academically for your field? "
3,b37eqi,t2_kb3cd,VegasBonheur,"YTA. She was right. Keep your promises, or don't bother making them. Her feelings were totally valid, and you're acting like she was unjustified in feeling the way she did. You're obviously not the asshole for leaving her, because forcing her to stay with someone like you would be bad, but the way you did it and the circumstances leading up to it put you squarely in the wrong."
3,b37eqi,t2_a47z5,Daizzey,"YTA. Not for breaking up with her, because it happens. But the way you handled it really wasn't cool. Honestly, you should have voiced your doubts when you had them, that way she would know that the relationship needed work. She wanted to fight for it, and you didn't. There isn't anything wrong with that, but you should have been clear about your feelings. "
3,b37eqi,t2_1cz04anu,Illumnyx,"YTA. That's just...wow...you do realize that by caving and saying you'd give things another chance, that gave her hope. Then you backtrack, just like she said you do with promises, and broke things off... Sorry man, but you handled this in the worst, most cowardly way possible."
3,b4ou9g,t2_zx9xy8t,Petovski,"NTA. He sounds potentially dangerous and it definitely sounds like a plot to get back into contact with you, otherwise why wait so much time to ask for it back? I’d say throw it out, let him know you no longer have it and make it clear he has no reason to contact you again"
3,b4ou9g,t2_pcitxcd,Wikidess,YTA for acting like its impossible to give the dude back his sweatshirt without seeing him. You could mail it to him. You could go leave it somewhere and inform him after the fact where he can pick it up (it's at the lost and found of such and such mall). You're overthinking this. 
3,akjma4,t2_2zs46rds,corploafer,"Tricky but NTA for not telling him. Frankly it’s rumors and your family can tell him directly. If you want to handle it maturely, but still want to make sure he has been informed, id go with a strength in numbers approach. Get Uncle Seth, and Mom and Dad together and let him know what you’ve heard. That way it’s not you sharing ‘hear say’ or spreading things. After that point, it’s up to him to do what he thinks is right."
3,ayt4mg,t2_2n52g94d,explosivedairyarea,"YTA. That’s theft, and you would be taking a seat from someone who paid to see Captain Marvel if the theatre were to fill up for that screening.

Shits gonna end up on Netflix or whatever in 3 months if you still want to see it."
3,ayt4mg,t2_cw6ry,ZestfulClown,"YTA, I didn’t know much about the “controversy” and thought Brie Larson said something racist or something, but you’re just a weirdo that thinks that a woman being told to smile more is okay Edit: read the wrong article, she did say something racist. You’re still an asshole for potentially fucking up someone’s day but not nearly as big of one. My bad"
3,ajv9il,t2_2x0wqzbz,leefloor,NTA But you can't make someone get well. You planted a seed. There are a lot of good resources for your friend. If she wants to get well she will be able to. 
3,anfda0,t2_z8xgm,Lovelyladykaty,"NTA — I don’t think you would be the asshole, but I would be very careful. Sometimes calling someone on it, even respectfully, can backfire. I’d hate for the person to turn it around on you and make you the bad guy. Just make sure this person you’re correcting is worth your time to educate. "
3,anfda0,t2_158jje,Gadaeus1,"NAH Mental health is a spectrum. Just because they aren't full blown doesn't mean they don't experience some form of it. That said, you wouldn't be wrong asking her to not be so cavalier about it."
3,adrfbl,t2_2catxs9v,DashEquals,"Going to go against the grain and say NTA. You gave them multiple warnings and they ended up breaking your window and injuring your kid. Sometimes, people need to be taught a lesson. If the ball wasn't on your property, it wouldn't have been destroyed."
3,adrfbl,t2_jtd94,batboobies,YTA. You just vandalized property and literally destroyed a child's Christmas present. What if their parents are in a tight spot financially and it was all they could afford? Super uncool. There had to have been a better way to handle this.
3,adrfbl,t2_i95npf,corsair1617,YTA. Obviously dude. Not only did you destroy their ball you did it with a bowie knife in front of him. You broke his stuff and terrorized him. I understand your daughter was hurt and you did have every right to be mad but there is still a right and wrong way of dealing with things. You can probably guess which one you did.
3,adrfbl,t2_lu35q3m,ddynoliaeth,YTA. He's a KID! Jesus Christ it's not like he intended to hurt your kid he just got carried away. All you did was encourage one more kid (and probably those other 7) to stay inside and never get exercise outside. 
3,adrfbl,t2_rz5fj66,Kecir,YTA. Not only did you destroy a child’s property over an accident but you threatened him with a knife. Huge asshole. Speaking to the parents or calling the cops would have been far more appropriate. What if the kids parents had called the cops and said you pulled a knife on them and cut the ball with it in front of them? You could have ended up in jail cause your behavior was enough to arrest you if they felt the need. 
3,adrfbl,t2_1i44mudl,Rea1Acid,"NTA. Everyone saying YTA are being so precious about this, they vandalised your property and then tried breaking and entering, anyone would have been pissed and lashed out. The appropriate response was to call the police, but a little frontier justice never hurt anyone."
3,adrfbl,t2_2g0um95o,EzSlayer,YTA not because you cut their ball in half but because of that intimidation tactic with the bowie knife you psychopath
3,adrfbl,t2_2lubtpmb,OfficialLokizone,"NTA - I did the same thing. Kids kicked ball against fence finding it funny when it spooked my horse. Burst his ball and his bubble, little brat."
3,adrfbl,t2_a5dbw,paulmp,"Seriously? You felt the need to ask? Definitely YTA, you're a grown man acting like a psycho. Imagine if it was some other parent pulling out a ""giant"" (to a kid it is) knife in front of your daughter and cutting up something she loved. Sure the kids are little turds that need to learn, but there was no ill intent on their behalf, where as what you did was malicious and cruel."
3,b358s1,t2_1xgi0kx9,immediatethor,NTA. It’s quite unfair for your mother to ask something like that of you. If she’s financially stable and healthy then why on earth would she need you taking care of her? I hope everything works out the way you want it to. 
3,asksij,t2_161h0l,FighterWoman,"I’m a woman, who were in a violent, abusive relationship once. I approve of the joke.

Yes if he's an adult, he is free to do whatever he wants but she is not wrong for being worried. She actually is being a good girlfriend imo. I know it sounds controlling but to me, it just sounds like your worried about the well being of your bf and there's nothing wrong about that."
3,b2d34y,t2_qzhsx,MakeAutomata,"NAH, You are allowed to be concerned with alcoholism, they are allowed to drink. Its not really a problem unless it becomes a problem.

So I'd say it is. Its perfectly fine for some people, but overall, its one of the worst if not they worst."
3,b89soi,t2_1jq26pdp,TinnyOctopus,"YTA. First, this was poorly planned. Enough oil to smell from outside the room is excessive. Second, there's no way you could live with someone and not know they have asthma. It's not that subtle. Third, you don't actually feel bad about almost killing someone. Regardless of your intent, that's what happened. "
3,b89soi,t2_2ebvwp30,candytastefuntime,"YTA. You are not a good friend. She should absolutely sublet that room and get out of there. When someone tells you that something causes them pain or discomfort, you believe them, you don't accuse them of being dramatic. You can seriously kill people with severe enough allergies doing what you did. I hope your lesson is learned. You are old enough to not behave this way."
3,b89soi,t2_2xjzy5,Otherwise_Window,"YTA. You triggered an asthma attack and are still calling her ""over dramatic"" about the effect it has? A has every reason not to be friends with you. You showed your true colours here. You have no empathy and are a raging asshole. (You can't ""de-oil"" a room. It will be years minimum before a cat will go near that room.)

Eva is also not your friend."
3,anieof,t2_2xffqing,strawberrypockystix,"NTA. The comment was totally unnecessary and was at your expense. Sounds like he didn’t understand how hurtful the “joke” was, and what’s worse is that he dismissed you. You just gave him a taste of his own medicine."
3,aj47lt,t2_4mgel,ext2523,"YTA for being upset >When she gave them to me she said “let me know if you don’t want to go, I’ll have someone else take your place.” She gave you the option to say ""No"", she said she had someone lined up to go instead. >Knowing my mother I knew if i did this she’d be pissed. Maybe, maybe not. You communicated with her already that you might be too busy to go. If she got upset over that, then that's on her. "
3,aj47lt,t2_t0gra,Rivka333,"YTA. You could have simply said ""I'm not going."" But you didn't. You said you *might* not want to go. What was she supposed to do without a clear answer from you on whether you wanted to go or not? Was she supposed to read your mind and know that ""might not want to go"" is the same as ""don't want to go?"" And she gave you the option of backing out after she purchased your spot, but you didn't take that option. Yeah, maybe she would have acted pissed, but you still had that option."
3,afrsu0,t2_58eiela,does_taxes,"YTA for giving two shits if she's legit depressed not, and two times the asshole for catfishing her to try and trap her.

3,acww5m,t2_ehua9,FreddieTheDoggie,"YTA. You are judging her food, but you choose to rationalize it as informing her off nutritional information. I'm sure this may not have been the first time you've judged her food choices either and she finally cracked. As you said, she is an adult. If she asks for your expert commentary on her food, happily offer it. But if not, keep it to yourself."
3,acww5m,t2_rdh6z,Vrassk,YTA but its deeper than a simple comment. She needs to feel safe and ok with her choices around you. If she eats a sandwich and you make a negative comment she will have to put up a defense around you or fear judgement. It's no longer a relaxing moment but a tense one. No one likes to be on guard around their so or in their home. 
3,acww5m,t2_npcu11l,mathxjunkii,"YTA. And her breakfast sandwich sounds delicious. Did she make it herself or did she stop by Panera? Panera has something very similar, and I 100% recommend their breakfast sandwiches if she enjoys that type of thing- let her know that, would you? It might even win you some points back after you acted like a total jerk this morning. "
3,acww5m,t2_gut70yi,DurandirX,"YTA + INFO I think you didn't tell the full story, nobody cries for a comment on food except if there is something else going on.

3,acww5m,t2_197avcze,longdu4,"YTA! Dude come on! It sounds like you LOVE Paleo and good on you for picking a diet that is healthy for you. It even sounds like your GF makes an attempt to eat paleo with you, even though it sounds like she doesn't enjoy eating that way ALL THE TIME. What you did was extremely shitty and if you have said stuff about her food choices before similar to this, its an even bigger deal. You need to apologize to her, those type of comments can really do damage to someone."
3,acww5m,t2_2n7s491p,xsamannx,"YTA. Your girlfriend can have cinnamon rolls and waffles with maple syrup and you shouldn’t make any comment. I would be pissed.

3,acww5m,t2_14p39g,Ichoro,YTA: She didn't ask for your input. This was a straight up dick move and the fact that you did it to your girlfriend is even worse. You should apologize if you don't wanna end up single within the week.
3,acww5m,t2_v52u5,enigmaticowl,"YTA. You yourself said that she eats healthily, so clearly you know that she knows what is healthy and what is not. You know that you weren’t “enlightening” or “educating” her on nutrition because she already knows healthy from unhealthy. So if you didn’t want to share knowledge, you clearly had to have been sharing an opinion. And she already knows she splurging, I’m sure that’s not just a careless decision for her, she probably had already thought it over and finally decided to give in to a craving this time, and then you go and make her feel even shittier? Yeah, YTA. Not sorry."
3,acww5m,t2_2emokka3,bastigesinatree,"YTA. STFU. You eat your paleo and STFU about her food choices. Are you her doctor? Is she 2 years old wanting candy and ice cream for every meal for six months and you're her parent? No? Then shut your mouth. If this one episode caused her to cry, then you've probably actually made about 900 similar comments and this one just was the breaking point. Shame on you!"
3,acww5m,t2_yg8kz,danimals3,YTA. No one asked you dude. STFU. And stop defending yourself saying it was just commentary on the “nutritional aspect” of her food (“it’s not like I forbade her from eating it”). Yeah that’s not an important distinction worth making. The point is you couldn’t HELP yourself having to explain to her a simple concept I guarantee you she gets. Like you just had to blurt it out. Do you feel compelled to do this at other times too? I’m asking because your GF CRIED. That sort of reaction cold possibly mean she is fed up as all hell.
3,acww5m,t2_60uor,hr342509,"YTA. How would you feel if she were, let's say, vegan, and commented on your diet? You'd probably be frustrated. You're trying to guilt her into not eating something, and that fosters an unhealthy relationship with food. I'm personally vegan and eat (kinda) healthy and my SO is not. I NEVER comment on his food about environment, animal rights, nutrition, etc. because it's NOT my place. You're being a dick so you should stop it. "

Take out is decided by who's idea it is... you want it, you buy it, yes I'll take half that pizza LOL anything else, is on you. You want, you buy, etc. Hubby makes more money than me, and he has a more expensive car, and gadgets from Amazon. LOL I work a side gig for extra money, and I buy crap from the thrift store. But the NECESSITIES are 50/50 Don't be afraid to tell him to suck it up, or pay rent on his own.

3,b1z6r2,t2_q373g,NoctiferPrime,"YTA. It was a bit of a roller coaster for me reading through your post, as an adult with a step-parent. To preface, let me say good on you for giving it your best effort to form a good relationship with your step-daughter, I wish my step-dad had given any kind of shit about me. Where you're the asshole is assuming that she should turn 18 and immediately leave, or that somehow you've ""put your time in."" When you form a romantic relationship with someone, they are a package deal with their children. Maybe they'll move out at 18, maybe they'll stay much longer for whatever reason. It's understandable, honestly, that you want it to just be you and your fiance. But when and how your step-daughter leaves is not your call, in any way, ever. Feel free to talk to your fiance about it and express your concerns, but you would absolutely be a massive asshole if you just booted her. >My fiancé will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it’s for the best. For the best, *for who*, exactly? It won't take long for your fiance to realize that it was a selfish decision on your part. I don't know just how close your fiance and her daughter are, but it sounds like they have a very good relationship. If she loves having her there, and you just kick her out, at bare minimum she will resent you for it. In my case, my Mother would have *left* my step-father before she ever let him kick me out before I was ready. Is it really worth potentially blowing up your relationship with your fiance just to get rid of her daughter? Kick her out if you want, but don't be surprised if you end up alone. "
3,b1z6r2,t2_407rv58,AggressivelyEthical,"YTA, and judging by how you've replied to other commenters, I think you're also exaggerating or misrepresenting how disrespectful the daughter is to you. I believe that you feel it's your house, your fiancée, but not your daughter, and you just want her out. You need to understand that tying yourself to her mother means you get the kid too as a package deal, and chances are if you kick one out the other goes, as well. You should reconsider your mean-spiritedness and just wait until the daughter has saved enough to move out of the house on her own, or you risk living there alone."
3,b1z6r2,t2_10xyw5w,RareRino,"YTA, a massive, raging, throbbing asshole at that. She's only 19, fuck, most people don't even move out until their early 20's, not to mention her **legal guardian, and actual parent** wants her to keep living at the house. You try to kick her out, and I guarantee it will not end well for you."
3,b1z6r2,t2_elfuf,waterbuffalo750,"YTA. This is a tough one for me. I'm really not opposed with making an adult move out of the house, they should move out of the house. But you've just got a lot working against you here. You're ultimately holding a grudge for a teenage girl being moody with a stepdad that came into the picture as she was old enough to resent the idea. And claiming ""it's your house"" is pretty petty. You need to get that figured out so everyone feels like they have a home, whether that involves fiance paying rent, or redoing the deed, or whatever it takes. It's a family home. "
3,b1z6r2,t2_78pc5,micky21098,"YTA She's still practically too young to be fully emotionally mature, and while it's understandable how upsetting her treatment of you is, her being pissy and abrasive isn't enough of a reason to remove her from the house. Her mother lives there too, and it isn't your place to boot her."
3,b1z6r2,t2_27ajcae2,amandae123,"YTA: the way you keep saying your house means that this isn’t a real partnership between you and your fiancé. Also, what do you consider being disrespectful? I can tell you that if you kick her out, your fiancé will probably go with her, so make sure you are prepared for that "
3,b1z6r2,t2_2qzpxthr,golddustwitch,YTA- shes only 19??? most people don't move out of their houses right after high school although I wouldn't blame her if she did want to with the way you are acting. You should care how she takes it - you're in a long term relationship with her mother who loves having her there. 
3,b1z6r2,t2_9d4jv,readerchick,YTA. Your SO will be a mom for the rest of her life. That doesn’t mean daughter will live with you forever but she will still be a parent and have to deal with daughter’s issues for the rest of her life. It sounds like you were expecting her to leave the day she turned 18. She’s pretty young still. She may leave and come back. If she is disrespectful towards you then that should be dealt with. Does she help around the house or pay rent? Does the mom even want her to pay rent? A lot of parents don’t but she can at least be doing chores. 
3,b1z6r2,t2_la80h8z,maps_on_the_wall,"-I don’t care how she really takes it YTA. You’re throwing out the feelings of her, and you obviously don’t care about her if you put step daughter in quotes but not fiancé. You stated yourself her mother loves having her daughter around. If you don’t like it you have no legal obligation holding you back. "
3,b1z6r2,t2_1628qf01,OrangeSockMonkey,"YTA if you do this without your fiancee being ok with it. That's still her daughter even if she is an adult, also not all children up and leave right after high school. You should have considered this when you got involved."
3,b1z6r2,t2_rsoto,eatthebunnytoo,"YTA I would have gone with you not being an asshole but other than saying you expect a 19 year old to be fully financially independent and that you don’t have a relationship with her, I’m really not seeing that she is unreasonable to be living with her mother. She has a job too, so not like she is loading at home smoking weed. I’m going to guess she saw right through your attempt to make a relationship happen by buying her a car. "
3,b1z6r2,t2_471l0f1,throwaway_ay_ay_ay99,"YTA All your “It’s my house” responses make it seem like you’re not really looking for clarity here and mostly just validation, which I don’t think ya got. Also YTSnowflake. You didn’t mention anything but indifference from your step daughter. I’d gladly take indifference from some of m family members. Try harder, be more creative, but if “It’s my house” is your mentality then I’m guessing your tries weren’t all that great."
3,b1z6r2,t2_ducfj,Cockwombles,"YTA The worst thing anyone can feel is not welcome in their own home. It will cause her problems for life. She already probably went through something unsettling when her parents split up, and she needs stability still even though she is growing up. Above all, it’s really not your decision, it is her mothers. If it will upset your fiancé, why are you even considering it? Doing this will turn them both against you, or cause a rift between the mother and daughter. Chances are about 50/50 that you will be the one leaving. >To be blunt I don’t really care how she takes it. My fiancé will probably be a little upset. Yes you are an asshole. No. You really have no say in this, sorry. You can discuss your feelings with your fiancée, but I think it’s just something you have to put up with for a few more years."
3,b1z6r2,t2_2pg70np3,Exiled_From_Twitter,"YTA. But what a shitty situation you're in. If you were to just attempt to kick her out without consulting her mother that would be classic asshole. It's your girlfriends house just as well and you can't unilaterally kick out her daughter. Of course you would be justified in pressing your gf on wtf is going on with her daughter and even push to get her to leave. I mean I completely understand where you're coming from, and I empathize, but that's just the nature of your relationship right now. "
3,b1z6r2,t2_fu0l3cw,Tin_Lunch_Box,Yta. Shes 19. Shes a kid. Suck it up for a couple more years. I know it sucks being the step parent but its what you signed up to when you started dating someone with a kid. Im sorry she was a cunt about the car but that still doesnt give you a right to kick her out. 
3,b1z6r2,t2_4go1hyy,BrownEyedQueen1982,"YTA You don’t come between a parent and her child. If your gf wants her daughter out she will talk to her. Until then mind your own business. Being indifferent towards you is not disrespect. Respect is earned not given, and other than trying to buy her affection with a car, what have you done to ever try to get to know her? "
3,b1z6r2,t2_1hq21elc,littlebabyheifer,"Yta, no need to kick her out but you could just take away the things that you gave her; such as the car— etc. if she has a job then she can save up to buy her own. Your fiancée can assist with helping her buy a new car if that’s the case. Just do basic discipline of taking away things. No need to make her homeless. From now on, just make her pay her own bills and buy her own car."
3,b1z6r2,t2_1ibz3jtz,goodatbeingaverage,"Eww. Eww. YTA. You are sooo the asshole. Your fiancé loves having her barely-an-adult daughter around, she’s trying to be responsible and save instead of moving out before she can afford it, and you just want to kick her out? You’ve been in a relationship with your fiancé for 8 years, but she’s had a relationship with her daughter for 19 years, and in only one of those relationships does she have a lifelong commitment. Get over yourself. "
3,b1z6r2,t2_1p4pxukw,californyeahyeahyeah,"NTA - **She's been living with him for 8 years, people.** Forcing her to move out isn't a dick move. She has a job. She doesn't respect or acknowledge his efforts and kindness. He's already done more than enough. She shouldn't be allowed to freeload because it's convenient!"
3,at6n0h,t2_qwwdt,mm172,"YTA. It's not that your intentions are bad, but if you suspect he already has dysmorphia, I think there's a very real risk that pointing this out to him will make him paranoid about his skin rather than solving the problem. Have you considered treating him to a facial, or some other activity where you he might be able to talk to a professional and get advice and strategies for dealing with the problem long-term?"
3,at6n0h,t2_1al2wg5z,Grubej2,"NTA - you could approach it saying you discovered one of the YouTube channels that do it and want to try it out. If he's self conscious about it, just remind him that by doing it they would be gone. Then he will see how easy it is, and start doing it himself. Win/win"
3,at6n0h,t2_1992ynkl,ETanny,NTA - Maybe get some of that black head remover face mask stuff and do it together? Make it light hearted and fun and he probably won't even realise what you have just done. 
3,abzqwn,t2_2tlqxd3z,CuckLab,NTA. You even went to the bathroom so you should be fine. If you know they are hippies then maybe you can ask them if it’s okay to use it in the house. That way you don’t have to hide every time you vape.
3,adrjgb,t2_11w15zni,K19081985,"NTA - pets don’t always get along. You’re not leaving the cat at a shelter where it will be killed. You’re leaving it with a human that clearly loves it and will care for him. This isn’t abandonment. I actually think you’re making the more responsible choice here. It may have something to do with the $1500 price - wow, that’s a lot for a cat! Still tho. I think it’s a reasonable option rather than forcing those two cats to live together. "
3,adrjgb,t2_qwwdt,mm172,"NTA. It sounds like this cat came into your life so he could find his real forever home with your roommate, and you’re a good pet owner for wanting what’s best for everyone. (Except maybe your boyfriend, but if he’s upset about losing the cat because he’s developed a bond, he kinda needs to speak up.)"
3,adrjgb,t2_14pr3n,Samizee,NTA for all the reasons others have said and bonus points for letting your roommate keep the more expensive cat without trying to have her buy it from you. That proves you are NTA and are really just trying to make sure both cats have a happy and loving home. 
3,b49vtm,t2_2zi8oo1z,lexen3997,"NTA. What I'm about to say sucks, you need to let it go. She is an adult, one that can make her own decisions, shitty ones at that, but her decisions regardless. I have a friend like this, except the guy is her age, I'm just waiting for the inevitable end and ready to support her thru it. This man is older, he knows what to push and when to do so, you're not gonna do anything but make her weary of being around you. Just gotta wait it out and hope she gains enough sense to drop the asshole. "
3,b49vtm,t2_99gcgn0,cactuspenguin,"NTA obviously, I don't think this is the right sub however for people to help you how to deal with this. I agree that as a friend you should try to make her realize what a shitty person he is. But how to approach this - ask someone with more understanding of psychology and how to help someone in an abusive relationship. Never stop continuing being her friend. When she does eventually realise what kind of person he is, she will need someone she trusts and that she can go to for support."
3,akocg6,t2_1c8909at,Super-Shenron,"I'd say NTA. I don't think any group is supposed to stop harmless jokes just for Kitty's sake, unless those bring up difficult memories (which doesn't seem to be the case). She either isn't in the right group, or she needs to lighten up."
3,atcfa9,t2_1vxf4e8k,dammit-david,"NTA, or at least you wouldn't be. It's not your responsibility to take care of your friend. It sounds like she has continued to cross boundaries that you set up, and that's not okay. It sucks that she's going through a lot, but you aren't her therapist. She's hurting you and avoiding responsibility. I recommend you take the steps you need to take care of yourself. "
3,a9vjsi,t2_t5stfs7,HilariousInHindsight,"NTA. If a guy got wasted and made a female gamer pal uncomfortable by asking her to play with herself for him, he'd either be called a creep or have his balls busted for being a drunk moron and rightfully so. She did a stupid, weird thing and should be held to the same standard. You weren't even being mean about it, you were just poking fun at the situation."
3,aovzws,t2_uc8n6,turandokht,NTA and your girlfriend is highly controlling and toxic. Dump her and pray she hasn't eroded your friendships too greatly to be revived.
3,aovzws,t2_zo2c2,HCHwdc,"NTA - Run for the hills. This is not a normal request. It’s not like you’re spending one on one time with a girl you’re attracted to. They are your friends and you shouldn’t have to give them up because she is insecure. If you think it’s a great relationship, I’d try and get your gf to meet up with your friends so she can have more of a relationship with them too. "
3,aovzws,t2_34zth5fe,alwaystired7, NTA This is manipulation plain and simple. What you are describing IS in fact jealousy issues. She is forcing you to end friendships you have had for years because she is insecure and afraid you will cheat on her. It’s unfair of her to put her issues on you. Since you’ve already tried talking to her about it and she’s denied the issue and gotten mad and blamed you for it then I say get out while you still have friends. It will only get worse from here. It’s up to you to decide if she’s worth losing your friendships over. Good luck.
3,aovzws,t2_j3usfmy,toshido22,"NTA. She sounds super controlling, jealous, and insecure. You need to end things ASAP. Things are only going to get worse. Are you going to have to quit a job because there are female coworkers, or you might have to interact with females at work? Are you not going to be allowed to go to the mall because there are women there? Her insecurity and jealousy are very toxic."
3,aovzws,t2_50ubynm,GoombaStompah,NTA. Being accused of checking out women while browsing through Netflix??? Chick is tapped dude that is behavior past the brink of hysteria. Now you know what a psycho is. Dump her and heed the lesson. Now you know what not to date...
3,b3chef,t2_37kyjr7b,RazzlleDazzlle,"NTA, your wife’s gotta cut the cord some time. Your marriage should be a priority over your child, tbh. And a lot of times doing what’s good for the child will make them upset and that’s *okay*. Let her cry it out, she’ll survive. Go be with your wife. "
3,b3chef,t2_3nni6,weemee,NTA. I know a guy who was dealing with this with his eleven year old daughter. I’m sure he never thought the issue would continue that long. I’m not sure when it got resolved. The sooner the better. Good luck. 
3,artcne,t2_74nun6d,Jthepunk,NTA but your brother doesn’t need to let you on his bed but also doesn’t have to yell insults at you and make you feel bad for something that was just an accident. 
3,b9zxxj,t2_2uwvwcqw,_retardigraded_,"YTA. Life happens. Tantrums happen. Something else could happen at the wedding too - cake may fall down, someone may have a heart attack. You can't control every aspect of the wedding day. I feel so sorry for MOH that you are even considering this. You need to support her. Ask her if she will need an extra caregiver that day since she will be busy with her duties. Grow up and invite the child. "
3,9zrz5g,t2_s29tm21,constaleah,"NTA. I would maybe call the manager and ask what the problem is. Is this a neighborhood where they've been robbed or their car stolen or ticketed? Hopefully it's not just laziness, but it sounds like there is a reason they don't want to go upstairs, some past experience that makes them leery. I'd ask. "
3,9zrz5g,t2_17ie94,Megjam,"NTA at all. It’s laziness on their part. Their job is to deliver pizza...they should deliver it to you even if that means, gasp, having to walk up stairs! I live in an apartment and have a young baby and hate when delivery drivers ask me to come down because they don’t want to park. You’re paying for it, they should deliver it right to you! "
3,b9sgn6,t2_pcitxcd,Wikidess,"NTA - sounds like he was trying to rope you into playing out some happy family narrative that doesn't fit your actual experiences, and it's totally okay that you don't want to play along. "
3,b9sgn6,t2_2qbja72s,sluttyfineapple,"I mean I’m stuck between NAH and YTA. I understand not getting along with parents because of their shitty behavior. But I also understand him wanting you to be a part of his life/wedding. I think the “don’t ever talk to me again” is a bit much. I don’t want to say you are overreacting because your emotions are valid, but once you calm down in a few months you may feel differently? Or may not. You do you dude. "
3,ab9cnr,t2_2n2fv4of,ByTorSnowCat,"NTA. Dick move on her part, but unfortunately there’s really nothing you can do. If it will be traumatic for you to see her with her new beau, maybe it is best that you don’t go to the party. If she is this inconsiderate, you’re better off without her."
3,ab9cnr,t2_2q1keymr,The_Dreaded_Candiru,"YTA. > This is my friend group. Not hers. That's not how this works. You don't get exclusive rights to your friends. Stop trying to control everyone around you to suit your preferences. It's up to the host to invite whoever they feel like, and if you have a problem with who's going, it's YOUR problem, not theirs. Is she being awful and inconsiderate? Absolutely. But you don't get to control her behavior, only your own. If you're not okay with seeing her and her new guy, don't go."

That being said, at least do him the favor of explaining how you feel and communicating all of that to him. Don't pressure him or give him a real ultimatum or anything - you definitely would be the asshole for that. But make it clear to him that you want a certain thing, and that if he can't provide it to you, you aren't going to waste your time with the relationship."
3,akso8m,t2_1aw99oim,lilyandcarlos,YTA: If you put more pressure om him (a Lot of guys panic when they feel pressed into marriage). The pressure he feels from you may be the reason he havent purposed yet. So give him some space. But why do you espect him to purpose? Why cant you pop the question? 
3,b4dxso,t2_17a3rc,MsCardeno,NTA - it’s nice some people prioritize that stuff and are so passionate but you have to focus on your wellbeing and life as well. This is coming from a married lesbian. Don’t let them make you feel bad 
3,b4dxso,t2_xv636,ex-inteller,"NTA. You don’t sound too committed to the cause. Missing work and school for a cause you don’t really care about is a big ask, even if you’re a complete asshole for not giving more of a shit about marriage equality."
3,b0qmsz,t2_3djijb6d,Michael_Scott_1001,"NTA - You're right, it is weird that she takes their pictures but it's not really your issue. I'd just tell her that it's weird and stalkerish just so she knows it's not normal behavior and move on. It sounds like you've already done that, so nothing you can really do. One day she'll look back on this and cringe hard tho"
3,b0qmsz,t2_xv636,ex-inteller,"NTA. It's a bit weird what she's doing, and unless she's angling for a three-way with the two dudes, she probably needs to drop it before it goes any farther."

3,audeqz,t2_ixyed,dadsmayor,I’m going to say NTA. My parents have a 15 year old cat that was declawed as a kitten. It is the most affectionate and friendly cat I’ve ever met. She never goes outside and it has never been an issue.

3,audeqz,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"YTA Google it. Seriously. I used to be a vet tech. After surgery, which is cutting off the entire knuckle, not just claws, an animal may be sitting in a cage with splatters of blood everywhere. Sometimes they get pain, and sometimes they act out. Other cats seem fine. But it's still a cruel procedure. Would you declaw dogs too?"

Honestly Your WIFE may not even want to be there herself and will likely hold it against you if you don't go and leave her alone in her obligation. It's lose-lose so might as well take your medicine gracefully. Also it's a catch 22. If she is the mythical unicorn who genuinely won't hold a grudge against you, then she is worth sucking it up for.

3,aftnyt,t2_4at5t,Lucavious,"NTA. You can stay with him, sure. But you absolutely can't trust him. He's cheated twice and maybe more. He will cheat again.

3,b8z7fh,t2_2k4gave0,GoldGangsta0211,"NTA: 4 dogs, 2 are yours, one randomly pees and the last randomly growls. Why don't you ask your friend that they just keep their dogs in their backyard and you just go over to their place to feed the dogs. Makes life easier."
3,am4zbz,t2_17u10d6r,Ontvx,"NTA, but I would get irritated if I saw you standing there and then a cart full of groceries just appears. I get it, but I’m sure people behind you don’t appreciate it."
3,b09tax,t2_2mh8nacs,magikarpjones,"Besides you needing to throw your own trash away, realize that those kcups can grow mold. If you choose not to clean up after yourself, and coincidentally no one else uses the machine, it’ll be ruined for everyone. Nice. "
3,b09tax,t2_atz7io,spykor,"YTA. My parents did this and it drove me crazy (I always threw mine out), but never to the point of bothering to make a fuss about it to them. If you're used to throwing out the old K-cup I can totally see why you don't think it's a big deal, but it definitely will mildly irritate others."
3,b09tax,t2_swespbk,JerseyShoreWebDev,"NTA Only because I want to fucking shake people who get so worried about having to take someone else's K cup out. If that company is doing so well that people can take time out of their job to hiss about your Keurig habits, then God bless. If not, gtf back to work lol"
3,b4ihws,t2_24zlzqj9,MistakenlyMad23,"NTA - He asked for not soggy pizza, and you were willing to clean it up. He is definitely the asshole. That being said, these are some major red flags. If he is treating you like shit over something this small, I can't imagine how he will treat you going forward. He seems to get irrationally angry at very small things like this, think about what he will do whan you have a bigger fight. Also &#x200B; >His reply was that “if you think that was yelling.. you have no idea. I can show you what yelling is”. &#x200B; This is a direct THREAT TO YOU. I would run. Seriously. This is scary shit and sounds like the beginnings of some serious domestic abuse. &#x200B;"
3,b4ihws,t2_j5hgw,Heidiwearsglasses,"NTA ovens can be cleaned- if it’s a new model it probably even has a self cleaning feature where you press a button and then when it’s done you easily wipe the ashes up. Seems like he’s overreacting and you should probably figure out why. Red flags are flying, don’t ignore them. "
3,b4ihws,t2_2uyazqs,PcsArePeopleToo,"NTA. I am pretty against putting anything directly on the rack but that does not justify the reaction, especially when you are cleaning it. Although it probably would have been better to give him the choice of soggy vs cooked on the rack after the previous fight. But seriously you are NTA and you are right to be worried about his reaction."
3,b4ihws,t2_z5ct2pt,Billi_Pilgrim,"NTA- he does not have the right to be mad because you cooked dinner, you tried to do it to his specifications, and you offered to clean up the mess (and did!). You're right that the yelling comment is disturbing. He basically threatened you. He's definitely the asshole, and you don't deserve to be treated like that."
3,b4ihws,t2_2qll5xvk,Rogues_Gambit,NTA I've never had soggy pizza maybe you need to leave it to cook longer lol. We never put it directly on the rack but a baking tray with foil on it
3,b4ihws,t2_1bdqders,DerHoggenCatten,"NTA. Your bf seems to want to have it both ways - not soggy pizza, but also no risk of messing up his oven. I think one compromise would be to put the pizza on baking paper. It allows through a ton of heat and still protects the rack, though the paper will turn pretty brown (and it may not tolerate super high temps so you will have to check the instructions on the paper)."
3,b9eyho,t2_30xjtdsu,JustTheWayIR,"NAH as long as you just give her your opinion on it. If this: > WIBTA if I told her no. means tell her no she can't do it, then yeah YTA. I would suggest your girlfriend look into (if she hasn't already) how people look years down the road after getting this done. Loss of buccal fat is one of the things that makes a person look older as they age."
3,9vc1ts,t2_x6cdp1k,SquirrelGirlVA,NTA. You tried to get together and he bailed. You're not his mum and he's a big boy. If he can't do the bare minimum for an assignment it's his fault.
3,a3vjz3,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"NTA. You admit you can't control him and you say you feel like he feels nothing for you. He's terrorizing his school. If he's a nightmare at 6, imagine 8. 10. 14. He's strong and apathetic now. What about when he can really hurt you and others at school? The therapy isn't working, and you know that you can't fix what he has. *You have a diagnosis, and that diagnosis says you can't fix this.* People will ignore that and tell you to keep trying, even though you're miserable, he's miserable, and his school and the other kids are miserable. You're not wrong to admit you can't handle him. Bad parents would insist they could handle it, while failing to control him. You've read about the parents where there child kills someone, and you wonder how they didn't get that child to someone who could handle them before it happened. Your life is a nightmare. Get him the help he needs and help yourself. Anyone who shames you doesn't understand the danger you're putting yourself and others in if he is violent and uncontrollable. You're unhappy, he's unhappy. Don't wait until he's 8."
3,a3vjz3,t2_6yuaf,Viperbunny,"NTA. You are in a really tough situation. You are doing all you can. I don't fault you for having issues. People don't understand how hard parenting is without these issues. This disorder is so challenging. I wish I had advice. It sounds like you are tired and beaten down. Can you see if you qualify for any services? Is the school providing him with the services he needs? There may not be much you can do. You may want to try /r/parenting because there may be people who can offer you advice. Whatever happens, whatever you choose, it sounds like you have tried really hard."
3,a3vjz3,t2_6q16o,MsTerious1,"NTA. You have a duty to provide a safe environment for your family. When it's one of your family that makes it unsafe, it's healthy to remove that person, even though some will frown upon it. It's a lot easier for people to judge it when they haven't experienced it, because people who have lived with experiences like yours KNOW that there is no such thing as a good outcome sometimes. Sad for you, but I think you deserve loving support, not harsh judgment. "
3,a3vjz3,t2_yvov,reticulatedspline,"NTA. Having feelings doesn't make you an asshole. If you act on them then it might change based on the circumstances, but you haven't yet. Sounds like a terrible situation all around and I feel for you."
3,a3vjz3,t2_2t54drt,Threethumber,I understand how raising a child with special needs can be but if you give up on this kid the YTA. If you follow this course of action then I would ask that you not adopt or try having kids in any other way. Just know that if you give up now that your just going to be the first of many and that will only make this child life worse.
3,a3vjz3,t2_trrnrz,thatssjtoyou,"I have no experience with adoption at all but I kinda think YTA. I understand he has issues but...hes a child. He's your child. I guarantee that if this was your biological son nobody in the comments would be telling you to put him up for adoption. You arent a terrible person for being worn down, but you'll be an asshole if you return him."
3,a3vjz3,t2_16cw3m,Jon-Cent,"NTA because the pain of taking care of a child that has RAD is tough. That is, if the question was ""AITA because I think raising my adopted son is very challenging"" YTA because you want to put him up for adoption. Like previously stated, if that was your biological child, would you still want to put him up for adoption. You committed to taking care of your son the second you adopted him. But still, you have to find therapists officially trained in dealing with RAD."
3,a3vjz3,t2_ia0fz,iimorbiid,"NTA You do whatever you feel is right, nothing else. Also I'm probably gonna get downvoted for this but why are people saying ""it's not like adopting a pet, you're actually taking responsibility for a child"" am I the only fucker here that actually believes that adopting a pet is just as big a commitment? I would **never** give up any of my animals for any reason, people here seems to think ""it's only animals"" which disgusts me. The difference here is that you say it might be a matter of your own safety, if you feel that you are not safe in your own home then you have to make the decision whether to continue raising this child or not. "
3,a3vjz3,t2_p9f3n,bradferg,"NTA. You should be seeing a therapist, too. Shit seems tough to deal with. The top comments seems to give the best advice. You're not the perfect angel sent to fix everyone. You just do your best. Don't beat yourself up--whatever your decisions."
3,a3vjz3,t2_17c778,smellslikefeetinhere,"NTA. You've gone further than I would've, and honestly I don't think it's going to get any better. Once he's old enough to do real damage it's going to tear apart your family."
3,a3vjz3,t2_8uhvdno,chocolatecryptic,"NTA. And if anyone says you are, they need to get off their high horse and try going through what you are. You are only human. I do hope this works out for you and him xxx"
3,a3vjz3,t2_raprb,Loveyouguysbut,"NTA. You’ve got to think about the rest of your life. Is this how you want to live? It’s a horrible situation you’re in. A friend told me about one of her friends who had to “give back” a 6 year old adopted son who touched her in a sexual way. It was too much for her to handle. I think I would’ve done the same thing. It’s not the child’s fault, it’s just that most people lack the capability or skills to handle certain emotional traumas. Good luck with whatever you decide. "
3,a3vjz3,t2_1oz6q2h1,emileo425,"NTA. Don't listen to the people on here that are trying to make you feel bad about your life. In the end, you can't live your life with regret and you can't live your life pleasing other people's feelings. Forget that. Try all your avenues and have everything documented and do what you have to do. Sometimes things don't work out and there isn't anything wrong with that!"
3,a3vjz3,t2_265c6n8v,ThisisLukes,"YTA. You can't just give the kid back like some gift you didn't want. He was put in the system as a baby who knows what he's been thru. You can't use generic tactics you get on forums to ""fix"" his behavior. Kids feel tremendously and can tell what's what. This kid needs more attention, more love. Home school setting would be good so you have more time to spend with him, to get to know him, to let him know that he is loved and cared for. Yes, you're an asshole for even considering to ""give back"" a child you've had for 3 years already. Maybe you should've took nature's sign that motherhood wasn't for you in the first place. Would you have given your child up for adoption if you had a baby who was a challenge or would you have loved them unconditionally and did whatever you needed to do for that baby? That child's been thru enough. I can't imagine how it would feel to be given back because I wasn't worth the effort. "
3,a3vjz3,t2_vopn0tn,Santafemyoldfriend,"YTA. This is a joke. Parenting thru adoption is no different than parenting thru natural childbirth. You didnt adopt a rowdy dog, you adopted a son. You dont get to ""give him back"". You clearly have no idea what it means to be a parent. Give him up if you really need to, but I hope you never ever think about ""adopting"" again in your life. You are not foster parents, omg. If you gave birth to a child 6 years ago, and he became too much to handle, how would you go about abandoning THAT child ???"
3,a3vjz3,t2_d2houhg,cleverbutnotoverlyso,"NTA. You’re still human. Some people are better equipped to handle the stresses of parenthood than others and it’s a whole other thing if the kid has special needs, especially if you didn’t know it when you got him. No matter what you do, be sure to do it for the right reasons and to the benefit of all. Wishing you peace, patience and wisdom to do the right thing for everyone."
3,a3vjz3,t2_15ncks,AnimeDreama,"NTA. What you are going through is overwhelmingly difficult forcanybody to deal with. Your emotions are valid and don't make you a bad or evil person. You clearly love your son or this wouldn't be a difficult thing for you to consider. RAD is a very difficult disorder to work with amd I don't envy you. There is no easy answer or solution here. All I can tell you is to continue to love him the best you can, give him attention and continue to work with him and therapists."
3,ajj9su,t2_12erm1,Perepip,"YTA. It's your ticket, not his. Free or not, why should he have to be responsible for something that you decided not to deal with? It's not his fault you chose not to pay the ticket. If someone did that to you I doubt you'd want to pay their ticket."
3,a4o62b,t2_focdf0o,catzinthecity,"ESH. You said in your post that your relationship was affected, and of course your mental health affects your relationship. But then later you said you are the main person affected and sort of implied it shouldn't matter to her if you go or not. But when you're in a relationship your SO is also affected so it does impact her when you don't get help. Her response of course wasn't helpful and was shitty too but she isn't wrong to feel slighted by you not getting the help you need. But I also sort of think there is more to this story if one snippy comment about something frustrating caused a break up. "
3,allagl,t2_10y034,centrafrugal,"YTA, kind of. You sound exhausting to be around. It sounds like you can't stand even the mildest of banter. At least you're aware of that and are hopefully doing something about your hyper-sensitivity. "
3,allagl,t2_jdubj,BullyFU,"YTA, the Beetle is a girly car and you getting upset over that, when you don't own one and aren't in the process of purchasing one, is ridiculous. It seems it was fairly innocent teasing on her part that you took way too literally and decided to get bent out of shape over it. You know it's stupid to get offended over that but you're still trying to spin things in a way where you can come out on top and that's childish. Get over it, it's just a car that you don't own. "
3,allagl,t2_hfzic,notevenapro,NTA. You have a right to be your opinion and she mocked you and insinuated you had anal sex. Just an FYI. It is a girly car just like pink but some of us can rock those girly things. 
3,aqprov,t2_4zyy5,TheBestCheese,"YTA I think you overreacted - I really doubt that your cousin is your mom's minion. You don't need to have any contact with your cousin if you don't want to, not you basically ghosted someone, and that's not cool. "
3,ba8jpv,t2_28dv1764,Nyctophobiana,"NTA I think what you're doing is hilarious. But, really, he can't force you to call him dad. Just keep saying no when he tells you to. Let him huff and puff and look like a lunatic over your simple no. You could also start calling him ""not dad""."
3,ba8jpv,t2_10kzanl4,TombBroom,"Hmmm NTA. He has no right to force you to call him ‘dad’. He is not your father and if he wants the title he needs to earn it, if he ever will. I know people who refer to their step parent as their name but still have a great relationship, they just don’t replace the other parent. "
3,ba8jpv,t2_29zhituz,ChasingMyCoattails,"NTA but this is hilarious. I switched from calling my father ""daddy/dad"" to pops because of some of the weird shit I've been witness to on the internet. If I called anyone ""daddy"" anymore, it would either be as a joke or because I wanted to make someone uncomfortable. That being said, I'd be annoyed af too if my mom's boyfriend asked me to call him dad. It's just weird. If he's not taking no for an answer, I'm thinking having a private convo with your mom about the situation might be good. I know she doesn't wanna take sides but you are her daughter and she needs to hear you. It's not right that she refuses to do anything about this even though it clearly makes you uncomfortable. And if she just straight up refuses to do anything, well, I guess she'll just have to get used to her 16 year old daughter calling her husband ""daddy"". "
3,ashi8g,t2_jvhpq,redstonecyanide,"YTA in this situation, but it sounds like you know that. I'm sorry, I know that probably sounds harsh. I know you're just trying to have friends and fit in, and that can be really tough at your age. Learn from this. 1. Just because they've developed a new hobby doesn't mean they dislike the old stuff. You can still have conversations about that stuff too. Maybe they're all talking about the new thing, but be on the lookout for ways to start a conversation, such as a new videogame or anime. Like, ""Hey have you guys seen Apex Legends? What do you think about it?"" 2. If you feel like they're unresponsive to you and your ideas, it's okay to let them know you're feeling left out. 3. If your friends in one group are completely unresponsive to you, it's okay to look for more people who share your interests. You can be friends with both groups. 4. You don't need to have large groups of friends to be validated, and you really shouldn't have to try super hard to fit in to a group or get that group's attention. 5. You can still apologize to them and try to fix things, if that's what you want to do."
3,b84s9a,t2_xv636,ex-inteller,"YTA. Starting shit with your teacher is a dumb idea. Accept that no one agreed with you, and you sound like a weirdo. Maybe work on why you feel the need to do this dumb, weird shit, perhaps with a therapist."
3,a0j1is,t2_761uu,Mcsmack,"NTA. If the bride says it's okay, then it's okay. Slacks, a dress shirt, and a tie is perfectly fine for a wedding. Trust me, everyone at that wedding has much more important things to worry about than what the SO of a bridesmaid is wearing. "
3,axt156,t2_5uyon,greenbastardette,"NTA for wanting an equitable contribution from your partner, but don’t ask her to be a homemaker. This isn’t 1955. Tell her you’d appreciate if she started contributing more, and if it’s not going to happen with an income, then you’d appreciate if she’d clean the house or make some meals. "
3,a52hhj,t2_11exz4,TheRagingScientist,"NTA. He wasn’t just ignoring you, but seems like he was actively going against what you said. And it’s not like you were being unreasonable. I’d be freaking out in that situation too. He should’ve been helping, or at the very least, following your instructions so he didn’t make it harder for you, trying to clean."
3,a52hhj,t2_15vx9y,impressivepineapple,"Others have said it, but NTA. If it was a laundry emergency, why didn’t he just go down there with shoes to do the laundry, and leave those shoes at the basement door as to not track around nasty pee water all over the house? I don’t have OCD and I’d be pissed as hell and maybe have left too. I can’t imagine how much worse it is with the OCD as well. "
3,a52hhj,t2_23lg4kgq,ButtStuffJR,"NTA I do firmly believe that you should get your shit under control. Get medicated, see a therapist, whatever. With that being said, his behavior showed just how much he respects you. You just cleaned those floors and he fucked them all up. I'd have shat on the floor and left. "
3,a52hhj,t2_2qa0p4g7,onechristmasprobl,"NTA I understand your frustration, but you know you're the one with the mental illness right? It's not up to him to work around your unreasonableness. You have to work on yourself. You're being unreasonable. "

It's not like it was sitting out on the kitchen counter or something. Yes, it's hard for you, and it sounds like you need to talk to your dad about it since it is making you uncomfortable, but just try to keep in mind that this is normal and although you are uncomfortable, it is not your place to make demands on his relationships."
3,ah0a9o,t2_1pclp81m,bagelwithclocks,"YTA. your dad is an adult and is making adult choices. Nothing you have said here is assholish behavior from your dad or his girlfriend. You have made a lot of judgmental comments with no justification. One year is a perfectly ok amount of time to move on from a relationship. People are allowed to have lingerie. Lube on the night stand was in their room, not out in the open. &#x200B; It does sound like you are having trouble processing your parents divorce. Parents divorcing is extremely hard on their kids, and parents should expect some level of assholishness from their kids. You shouldn't be expected to like or treat anyone new as a parent, especially soon after your parents have divorced. It doesn't sound like your dad is asking you to do so though, just to give her a chance."
3,ah0a9o,t2_26mbz04n,csway324,"YTA. I dated a man with a teenage daughter who was completely nasty to me for no apparent reason. I tried with her and it ultimately didn't work out because of her. Children need to stay out of adult relationships and you need to stay out of your father's room. That is his space, not yours."
3,ah0a9o,t2_jcl1v,skyrix03,YTA. Why would your dad need to hide that hes having sex? Why do you care what kind of underwear this new lady wears? Seems to me like you're just looking for excuses to be mad. If your parents couldn't be happy together they deserve to find happiness elsewhere. Its none of your business who they're with unless they're being measurably hurt by their partner.
3,ah0a9o,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,"YTA. No one is shoving anything in your face by doing something in the privacy of their own bedroom that you chose to enter. Your dad can be in another relationship. His relationship with your mother ended when the papers were filed if not earlier, not when the divorce was approved by a judge. People don't become nonsexual beings after they have children or after they get divorced."

3,ah0a9o,t2_1m0abdfm,LivingAtAltitude,NTA No one likes to think of their parent as a sexual person. I'd imagine it's even more cringe when it's with a new partner. It's good that she's kind to you and makes your dad happy.
3,ag4os8,t2_279oil6j,Ash_90528,"NTA- at the beginning I was thinking you might be the asshole, but after the you can just sleep on the couch thing, I've come to the conclusion that the others are assholes. I understand that price can be an issue, but everyone should be treated equally, and fairly. Nobody should be forced to get worse than the others when you all pay the same amount. You should get to enjoy your time just as much as the others."
3,ag4os8,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,NTA. You're paying extra for others? No. You deserve a bed on vacation. They want to throw a fit that they need to pay a little more or you have to sleep on a couch? Selfish. This isn't even a question.

3,b9qtbv,t2_20ujfgcr,itsstilltoospicy,"NTA your brother is an asshole. You do have a chance now to be the bigger person and help though, especially since you know first hand how dark things can get. It might also be an opportunity to rekindle the relationship if she was feeding him lies about you, although I wouldn’t go in expecting this. You’d be a saint if you did help but you also wouldn’t be an asshole if you decide not to. It’s your decision and either way you’re not wrong."
3,b9qtbv,t2_3jbmdt59,FBI_squad,NTA He deserves what he's getting BUT I'd still help him if I were you. Not financially but emotionally. It would firstly be a huge middle finger to his wife and prove that you were right. Secondly it could repair a once great relationship. I think you should try and be the bigger man here and finally come out on top.
3,b9qtbv,t2_9u7th,zoeyversustheraccoon,NTA but I wouldn't do anything that permanently destroys the relationship. People can change and he's your only family. Don't do anything you may regret later. Doesn't mean you have to start a super close relationship with him right away but you could just acknowledge the apology and keep living your life. He is apologizing after all. 
3,b9qtbv,t2_nd7mj,TheBoyJude,"NTA, he made his bed not one, not twice but three times if not more. Sucks for him, but just because you're brothers doesn't mean you need to be there for him no matter what."
3,b9qtbv,t2_wfbqi,NebulaSlayer,"NTA, it’s understandable that you are/were hurt. But I think if you find a place in your heart to move on and forgive him, you’ll be better off. Maybe he was in an borderline abusive relationship (from the very little you told, her trying to break you 2 apart and manipulating him to believe she wasn’t cheating, it seems that she is not a good person in the very least) and it’s hard to see reality when you’re in this position. This is not an advice sub, I know, but these are my 2 cents. All the best to you, anyway."
3,b9qtbv,t2_e2mfy,firenoodles,INFO: did he apologize for not helping you during your divorce? He apologized for not believing you BUT did he apologize for telling you to get fucked and cutting off contact for 2 years? I am leaning towards NTA. But there's the potential for ESH if he did apologize and you're continuing to hold a grudge against him.
3,b9qtbv,t2_r8ih0pb,ochu_,"NTA - what a hypocrite of a brother you have. If I were in your shoes I'd probably still help him though, if nothing else than as a chance to express how he'd hurt you and to show that you aren't the same as him."
3,b9qtbv,t2_qswys,Dracon_Pyrothayan,"NTA, but the wiser course is to help him anyway. After all, he's just now getting rid of the bitch that poisoned him against you in the first place - this is a good opportunity to help him scrub the scales from his eyes."
3,b9qtbv,t2_p026x,RussianEarlGrey,"NTA. This could be an opportunity to reconcile with your brother and maybe, with time, go back to having the close relationship you once had. But only if you want to. It might be that you feel like the relationship is truly dead and there is nothing there to rekindle. In that case, as sad as it might be, move on and ignore him. He only has himself to blame. You decide what you want to do. Either way, NTA in my opinion."
3,b9qtbv,t2_m7wyh,PEPSICOLA123456,Nta - but there’s no stronger bond than two brothers. I think you should help him out as it’s like an act of forgiveness and will hopefully remove the sourness between you guys. 
3,b9qtbv,t2_ftp1v,channy64,"I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. NTA The roles are literally reversed now. You two are the only family you guys have, and yet he couldn't help you in your time of need. Why should you help him now? Let him deal with it on his own, just like you had to."
3,b9qtbv,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"NTA - you could be the bigger person here and help him out, but honestly? Fuck him. He didn't support you when you needed it, didn't believe you when you tried to tell him about the affair, and now suddenly he wants your help and ""boohoohoo poor me""? Fuck that mess, move on with your life and let him figure it out. "
3,b9qtbv,t2_6wy2n,XenoRyet,"NTA technically, I guess. You'd be within reasonable behavior to just move on. That said, I'd think about whether or not you want to repair the relationship with your brother. Because if you do, now is the time, and this is how you do it. He's in a spot where he can maybe realize the problems with how he's acted in the past, and you're in a spot to show him that family can be there for you even if you've fucked up. You by no means are obligated to take that path, but you should do some thinking on whether or not you want to."
3,b9qtbv,t2_33fae6dv,hunt3rhunt,"NTA, and i believe its a sound judgement too. If you get involved, it will be messier. You will just be another bullet in the cheating wife's clip. Let him sort it out. Refuse any future invitation cuz you can probably draw from experience how fked up a divorce can be. "
3,b9qtbv,t2_17f80q,hallun123,"NTA & INFO: what kind of support is he asking for? If you want to have a relationship with him you could be the bigger man and support him emotionally, but I wouldn't support him financially. But I would also say your under no obligation to support him either. If he actually cares at all about you he'll take the emotional support and friendship and it might be a good opportunity to rekindle a relationship. "
3,b9qtbv,t2_b0qny,guitarguywh89,"NTA but consider that most of what hurt you likely came from his now ex wife. This is an opportunity for you to show how much of a bigger person you are. You don't owe him shit, but if you do help I would expect him to be even more grateful"
3,b9qtbv,t2_1x3ds49z,24Cones,"NTA. Although he wronged you long ago, and you’re not the asshole for not helping him, I believe it would be a chance to bond with your brother if you decide you DO want to help him. Nothing wrong with NOT helping him through this, but if you gave any emotional support I feel like you could mend some of your relationship and in general being the “bigger person” may help you feel good after it’s all done "
3,b9qtbv,t2_cvt5i,killer_orange_2,"NTA. Look let me ask you this question, what do you want from this situation. Do you want your brother to hurt like you did when he rejected you or do you want closure. He was wrong in the past and is now asking for help. Being blood does not mean you have to stay in a toxic relationship. However that also doesn't mean you can't repair the relationship if it will help you heal. This does not mean doing everything for him, but rather being supportive of him during the struggle. Do what is going to help you heal from your divorce and him being a shithead. I would also remember your wife got to see what he did to you and is hurt by that too. Talk through your decision with her, but do it in a way where it is not about hurting him for hurting you, but what helps both of you heal. "
3,b9qtbv,t2_dulrx,ARX7,"Nta, just remember you repeat his words neck to him if he asks. Also who doesn't check up after the allegation of cheating because it sounds like it didn't stop"
3,b9qtbv,t2_2fkssncp,timmyturnerdiedtoday,"NTA. I mean if you don’t want to you wouldn’t technically be an asshole. But knowing how hard your divorce was and how it feels like shit not having him there, wouldn’t you want to mend your relationship considering it’s only you two? At some point or even now you’ll look back and think about your relationship with your brother and think what happened? The wife was obviously poisoning him - and probably loved her a lot for that kind of shit to take affect deeply. And now he’s hurting. But it’s your choice, if you want to salvage your relationship with you brother, you hash out your issues with each other and start anew. Don’t bury anything. Note he said he’s sorry he didn’t believe you. Meaning he’s admitted his wrong, and her wrong. There is hope for you and your brother to be civil and close again. Or you can just move on. But some day you may regret it. Maybe. "
3,b9qtbv,t2_3fjp13yt,Nobody94-,YTA He’s your only family. You don’t have to stoop to his level and even you admitted it was his crazy bitch wife trying to turn him against you.. I have a little brother and even if he did me this way I wouldn’t hesitate if he needed help. 
3,b9qtbv,t2_k1le5,Rambo1stBlood,"YTA. You were both really young adults the first time around. It was immature (or perhaps, understandable because most people aren't fully mature at the ages you were.). Times have changed though....You are both adults. By doing the same thing he did at that young age, you are just acting like a kid about it....but this time its not understandable because you are not a young adult anymore. He said you were right about everything...do you really need more than that? You have a chance here to strengthen the relationship with the only family you have - Don't fuck it up. "
3,b9qtbv,t2_xnzpe,roqueofspades,"NTA but this is your chance to be the bigger person and rebuild a relationship with your brother. He may be a better person without his wife being toxic and manipulative toward him. Personally I think I would do it, but I certainly wouldn't blame you for not doing it."
3,b9qtbv,t2_25ddy3zw,IIDoggs,"NTA YES, your brother fucked up big time dropped the ball and turned his back. BUT, he needs your help I get the whole let him burn, it just seems too cold a dish to serve in this case. Life gave you guys a second chance to be close again, forgive and take it. I wouldn't just jump in with both feet, but don't turn your back on him either. Hindsight, if he he helped you back then, you may not be married or as close to the current wife. Something positive came out of it. Good luck to both you guys. "
3,b9qtbv,t2_2u8931er,misucaroline,"Yes you wbta if you did this and I’ll explain. It sounds like your brother has just had the veil lifted from his eyes. He was being gas lighted and was probably in a very emotionally and mentally abusive relationship. When one is in that type of relationships, the abuser does everything in their power to isolate their spouse from their family. Your brother hurt you. No one is denying that. But you are a better person. Someone above said to be who you are, not who he was. Who he was in the past was a person in a terribly abusive relationship. But now you have the opportunity to get your brother back and rebuild a relationship with him that can be the strong lifelong bond you both deserve. Think about it. "
3,b9qtbv,t2_3hxi22er,NoGoodDeed762,"YTA, A bit of a harsh judgement on my part, but that IS your Brother, right? Cut the crap out of the math, and ""help a brother out"". I was in a similar situation, not long ago. I help my BROTHER out whenever I can. He returns the favor, likewise. That is the deal. Period. Barring attempts on your life, or something else that crazy, don't let other people create drama between the two of you. Don't let your relationship turn into bad country music. Be the bigger man, and he will follow your lead."
3,b9qtbv,t2_6yuaf,Viperbunny,"YTA. Drunk texting is not irrelevant. You told your brother and he made a decision. You actively crossed a boundry he clearly set. He was the one who had something to lose and he did lose. You both have a lot of growing up to do and so does your wife. She doesn't get to decide what you do. Whether you help him or not, you have been behaving lilike an ass."
3,an8pb2,t2_2tm2gxjx,Ann-von-Beaverhausen,"YTA. But not a mega asshole as you’re trying to solve the problem. Honestly I would probably bring my own towel - who knows how clean they get theirs. Or grab a roll of paper towel out of the change room. Or wear wrist bands and a headband ‘70s style. You should actually just do that anyway, because that would be awesome."
3,axel0q,t2_2u3wuf9y,tairo-,NTA - It’d be different if you got on him for not washing his hands but having urine all over? Ew. He needs to learn to use a p u b l i c restroom.
3,ba6ule,t2_mkpvd9g,QueenMoogle,"Oof. ESH. But in reality if she cannot handle there being 4 women at your office, that is a pretty big red flag honestly. Seems like the level of trust in this relationship is pretty dang low. And I have to say, lying will only make it worse. Edit: you broke up, sorry. I’m glad about that. But I maintain my answer."

This is the flag that was waved by the KKK as they burned churches and lynched people. That the flag is a symbol of racism is not in question. The question is if you should be ashamed to display it. Yes, you should. You know what people do with heirlooms? They have them in boxes in their closet. Not hung over their desk as a statement of ""This is me. This is what I am proud of"". &#x200B; Your attempt to further damage this person of color is only going to make you more of an asshole, since it is going to put you on Fox news as a white supremacist."
3,b3s2dk,t2_37lfxgcq,Kitrak101,"NTA NTA NTA This lady was way out of line, the fact that she took the frame and smashed it makes her TA. Imagine if that glass cut your wife's stomach or hit someone in eye? She definitely shouldn't be working in a hospital. Also this flag is in YOUR house in YOUR room. She has no right to act the way she did. That ""young woman"" isn't a child, she is a grown women who had a temper tantrum, even after hearing the history behind your family's flag."
3,b3s2dk,t2_12ds7s,ThriftyLizzie27,"NTA- She went into your orivate office, damaged your personal items and hurt your wife. All not ok at all. As far as charges make sure they stick. She fucked up her own career by her behavior."

Regardless of my opinion of the confederates and the history of the civil war, (it's not all black and white, but yes the confederates did some bad things.) she destroyed private property. Theres no way you're an asshole. I will say one thing though, not all blacks were enslaved. Her ancestors may not have been enslaved blacks, and I'm not gonna make assumptions, but I'm willing to bet she didn't do any research about her ancestry to confirm her claim."
3,a86kbb,t2_2k8oi3ol,just_another_casual,NTA. Your mom bash on your dream and say that she doesn’t care about your dreams? No mother should ever say that to their child. Actually. No parents should ever say that to their child. You take your time when you want to accept it. I fully understand why you’re upset. It would kill me hearing that.
3,a86kbb,t2_1lvc81je,P_Flange,"NTA. Your mum has a cry about not fulfilling her dreams then shits on yours. Give up on glass blowing, become a pharmacist, then rub it in your mum's face about how you've stolen her dream. Or not. I mean it's a lot of work for a bit of petty revenge."
3,b1vqef,t2_fdkkf,thedup,"NTA, you kissed him because you thought he was cute, that doesn't mean you're leading him on, it means you in the moment maybe changed your mind. Leading him on has to be a conscious decision to be an asshole move lol. After the date are you still sure you don't want to be with him? If that's clear, fair enough, at least he got a nice cheek kiss out of it lol Z sucks though, what a creep"
3,b6ck7u,t2_9qnmm,Lawlzstomp,NTA I agree with your assessment that him lying and her apparently being shitty are good reasons for you to be upset with the situation. I would hope if you phrased it the way you phrased it your post that your SO actually hears you and is willing to make a change. 
3,b37qkk,t2_13l4ik,Deadly9750,"NTA. Scary movies are for lack of a better word, scary. I try to avoid then at all cost. If they legitimately bother you than your GF should understand and not bother you about it. I only believe she is the AH in this situation because she is still mad at you instead of moving past this. "
3,avjyev,t2_2veyqqiz,Aredhela_,"I’m strongly leaning NTA, as long as you weren’t in handicap or reserved seating. Based on what you said and the fact that there were empty seats... it seems like she just really wanted to sit in that location for whatever reason. Maybe you just look friendly or approachable?"
3,avjyev,t2_1bxk11qw,MsAurala,"NTA - As you said, there were other empty seats. And the huffy tone was unnecessary and would have annoyed me too. Sounds like you're rather polite actually. Honestly, even if you just flat out declined to move your bag and said there were other seats available, you still wouldn't be an asshole in my opinion."
3,aejroo,t2_1ctyfubn,JivyNme,"NTA: but you can still be supportive to your gf, being sick sucks on many levels. Could you suggest a second trip some other time so she doesn’t feel like she’s missing out completely?"
3,aejroo,t2_k1le5,Rambo1stBlood,"NTA, and it's not even your fault. Tell your GF she has bad luck to get sick like that so close to the trip - but ultimately you shouldn't be taking responsibility for her not being able to go unless you are the disease making her sick."
3,aru0cj,t2_38uvxif3,SaddensMe,"NTA You are an adult. You can decide whether or not to open up to your parents. The fact he was so inconsiderate and told you he “made no promises” when you told him not to tell your mother shows that he shouldn’t have the right to listen to you or the right that you gave him by opening up to him. I understand if you feel bad for not giving him the chance to help you, but if he isn’t considerate of your feelings and how important it is that you trust him enough to open up to him, then he doesn’t have that right to know anything about your life at all. Even though he is your own father. "
3,adrfp7,t2_2osjz7z6,SharpShel,"YTA. Here’s a parenting truth: we love our kids to the ends of the earth, but yes...our kids annoy the shit out of us sometimes. Especially teenagers (based on the phone charger argument, I’m assuming that’s the age range of you and your sister.) Had you been at home, dad would have told you guys to go upstairs, so he didn’t have to listen to your nonsense arguing. But you’re in a motel room. Arguing loudly. He wanted peace and quiet. He put you outside for 1-2 minutes so you’d knock it off, and you didn’t. Let your sister charge her phone, then you charge yours. It won’t be the worst thing ever, I promise ;)"
3,a4qh0w,t2_6zb4t,adenovellis,"NTA. If she knows the dog gets out all the time, it should have a damn collar with tags. She's an idiot owner. You did the best you could in your situation. I commend you for getting the slip leash and getting the dog off the streets.youre good peoples"
3,a4qh0w,t2_88j6b1n,MatterCaster,"NTA. She is because she is an irresponsible dog owner who is rude and ungrateful on top of that. You did nothing wrong. In fact, you went out of your way to save her pet. If you see the dog again, do the same thing, but next time don't leave any way for her to contact you. Just give the contact information for animal control."
3,apxa03,t2_2kx5gegv,Ihatecoughsyrup,"YTA. I am sorry, I agree that honesty is usually the best policy but there are different ways to say things. You told her in front of a group of people that she smelled of cat piss. You should have done it in a different way and above all you should have talked to her privately. I am not surprised that she cried. The whole experience for her was for sure very humiliating. "
3,apxa03,t2_175qe7,Tython199,"YTA You needed to tell her, you just picked a very asshole manner to do it in. Even if everyone knows, doing it in a group setting was not the way to do it. Everything is more devastating in a group. If she didn't know or had just grown used to it, she likely doesn't think the other people there knew as no one said anything to her. You called her out on it in front of who whole group. If you tell her one on one and let her down easy on it, you're not the asshole. Doing it in a group makes it much more hard on her and you much more of an asshole. "
3,apxa03,t2_qouiv,TouchMyAwesomeButt,"YTA for not going about it delicately. No one likes hearing that they smell, even less that they smell like cat pee. You should've taken her aside, told her you didn't want to hurt her feelings. But if she really wanted to know the truth, her body odor isn't very pleasant. "
3,apxa03,t2_6rj74,enna12,"NTA You weren't saying it to be mean. You were asked a question and answered honestly. Knowing that very well may have helped her to do something about her smell. I've always felt that if I smelled (not like a I haven't showered in three days and know I stink, but a I stink all the time and have no idea), I'd want someone to tell me."
3,apxa03,t2_phiaq,PsycoticANUBIS,"NTA. I am not afraid to let people know when they smell. If they know they smell but don't care, they are just rude. If they don't know they smell but find out they do, they can work on the problem. Personally if I smell I want someone to tell me so I don't make the people around me uncomfortable or even possibly sick."
3,apxa03,t2_2sa3f7yt,mgood1938,"NTA. Maybe I would've told her this in a 1 on 1 conversation instead of around others, but regardless, I think it needed to be said.

3,arm0yc,t2_ycxwx,viajar-es-vivir,"NTA at all. If you say you don't want a drink and he buys one for you and insists you drink it, that was completely his decision and he should have to pay for it regardless. Stand your ground and don't drink if you don't want to, especially if it agitates your anxiety. It sounds like your friend is going through a really tough situation and if there's anyway he can get some counseling, I think that would go a long way to helping him (and you)."
3,a43d81,t2_pws4opb,paintedpinecone,"NTA - You have gone above and beyond for your mother and the dog. It doesn’t seem like she wants the dog back at all (& even if she did, she already proved she can’t take good care of him), so rehoming him would be the best thing for him. Thanks for sticking up for the dog & getting him healthy! "
3,a43d81,t2_qrfkb,cautionjaniebites,"NTA If you choose to rehome him please look for breed specific rescues to help you. Pounds suck as do most shelters and just no to Craigslist. If you like him though, maybe things could be easier once you move And you can try to keep him? "
3,aobql4,t2_h24nvv,moe-kalong,"NTA I agree with everyone that tells you to leave this punk, if not at least talk to him and try to put him to reason but I'm afraid he will be very hard to change (himself) because after all he only can change himself if he wants to.

3,axfrqy,t2_2b56o8g8,_fuck_this_shit__,"YTA. Not because you asked the first time, but because you didn’t take no for an answer and asked again. The middle seat isn’t comfortable for anyone, regardless of height. He booked his seat, and he has no obligation to trade with you because you’re tall. I understand flying is uncomfortable for tall people (husband is 6’5, I’ve heard all about it many times) but if someone says no to switching with you then you need to accept it and move on. "
3,axfrqy,t2_fsq9u,No_regrats,YTA and also obviously trolling/shitposting. He booked his seat well in advance and paid extra for it. It's clear that you felt entitled to his seat but you actually aren't. You asked for a favor. He politely declined. You should have left it at that. He likely did not find joy in seeing you suffering since he was pretending to be asleep according to you. You are not the center of the universe that you imagine you are. Edit: LMAO at OP's having a temper tantrum and leaving. Now I am thinking she wasn't trolling and that she truly did feel this entitled. Definitively the asshole.
3,axfrqy,t2_rz5fj66,Kecir,"YTA. He paid for the seat, told you no and you should have dropped it. Your unnecessary need to go on and on about how short he was in your post makes me wonder if he even really freaked out so quick or if you kept pestering him and that was when he snapped at you. You act like you are 7 ft 5 or something."
3,axfrqy,t2_bq462,subsetsum,"YTA. You don't get to ask someone to give up their window seat for a middle seat. You picked 12E knowing it was a middle seat, which sucks for everyone tall or not, then have the unmitigated gall to not only ask 12F to switch for your crappy middle seat, but then to insult him to boot? Next time, book the seat you want. Also are you a troll or what? This can't be real. No one could be this entitled. "
3,axfrqy,t2_ie8e4,Axelean,"YTA for being an entitled asshole. He paid the same fare as you, why should he give up the things he PAID for. He is not obligated to help you in any way. You asked, he declined, that should be the end of discussion for any DECENT human being yet you kept pestering him"

Same sentiment as the people saying NAH, but the reason I think you're an asshole is you expect him to be able to modify his behavior while giving yourself a pass on yours.

3,aije30,t2_ojmdn,missinglynx61,"I suspect in every jurisdiction, you will be required to pay her for the work performed. As you also warned her of what would happen if the litter box was not cleaned, you can also sue her for the damage caused by her failure to clean it.

Has it occurred to you that during your 7.5 week absence, that your cat started acting out because s/he missed you? Cats do that all the time.

3,aije30,t2_15vx9y,impressivepineapple,"I think YTA if you don’t pay her at all. She did the first 2/3 of her duties, and then half of the last thing. You should pay her 5/6 of $1000, so $833. She still did the other work. "
3,aije30,t2_bdno8,Devilsfan118,"lol NTA In fact, you should be going after her for damages tbh. The mother should consider herself lucky you aren't. If they keep dicking you around, maybe you should threaten that to see if they'll shut up."

It’s your job to be worried, and it sounds like you’re not one to yell much at all if you’re even posting this. Just don’t yell - it’s the quickest way to chase your kid away. Maybe give her a portable phone charger and a little space to be herself. "
3,acx62a,t2_1oq0ls5p,pukui7,"YTA There was no need to yell at your daughter. Do you really want her thinking that's normal appropriate male behavior? She's an hour late. Don't let that slide, if it's such a big deal to you. But don't be an ass about it.

3,acx62a,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"YTA. But only a little. You were worried and scared. Something could have happened to her and when someone who is responsible goes dark and stops replying? It's scary. Get her a portable charger/power pack. Tell her to keep it fully charged and carry it with her in her bag. That way if her phone gets low on battery, she can plug it in. This was a mistake on her part, but she's clearly a very responsible teenager and keeping her on groundation when she already has so much responsibility isn't fair at all. Cut her a break, have a serious conversation about WHY you yelled at her, ad let it go."
3,acx62a,t2_npcu11l,mathxjunkii,"Nah you’re fine. You’re NTA. But she needs to understand that even adults call people they live with if they’re going to be late. If my boyfriend told me he’d be home at 10, and it got to be 11 and he didn’t show up and wasn’t answering the phone id be soooo anxious. I don’t care if he’s late, or doing something with his friends, but tell me if you’re going to be later than you said so that I don’t think you died. In reality, she’s a 16 year old girl, and as a girl who has been 16, 17, 18, etc.... I remember what I was doing when I “lost track of time”. But with the way you’ve described your daughter, she’s *fine*, even if she has started “losing track of time”. I wouldn’t worry about that if I were you. (But it definitely explains the lack of phone call). I would say, for now, tell her she has to text you if she’s going to be later than she’s suppose to be. Promise not to ask questions or request a phone call, but tell her you need a text saying “I’m going to be late”. And tell her it can’t be after 11. If she needs to set an alarm for 9:45 on her phone to remind her - do it. (Or if she has a Fitbit, she can set a silent alarm that will just vibrate on her wrist, and remind her to text you. That way, none of her friends will ask about it and she won’t feel embarrassed that she has to call her dad). It’s just a learning curve for both of you. You’re fine. "

He should have called. He should have texted. He should have asked. We have 2 kids under 3 yrs old so sex is... Scarce. I feel like he didnt call me because secretly he wanted the massage This sounds a lot more like he was totally blindsided by the ""gift"" but accepted it because you set it up for him. If he really wanted to deceive or take advantage of the situation, he really wouldnt come out of the situation and immediately jeopardize his relationship by telling you. This is like filming a crime you are committing. Now if you think your husband is an absolute idiot who couldnt get away with a crime or have more INFO on his reaction, I might be NAH or NTA."

He came to you for sex after, remember, didn't just ""relieve himself"" during the massage."

He knows you sent him there, paid for it, and intended him to get it. He had no idea you didn't know the whole of it. You did put him in that awkward situation that he wouldn't have otherwise gotten tino. I'd suggest you could sit down and admit you didn't really know what it was, and in the future, you would have liked him to say no and come home, but you're not mad with how he handled the situation.

You said yourself there might have been a slim chance this kind of massage was your intention. He even felt uncomfortable and told you so upon arriving. He did not leave, he thought this was your gift. He did not text or call, because he thought this is what you wanted. Sex being scarce would make me think this was your intention even more if I were him. Just own up to this stupid fuck up and both have a laugh at how ridiculous this situation is."

But I guess YTA because you can't take it out of him. You and your husband should be on the same side of this. He barely got touched. There's a huge difference between making him come, stroking him, giving him a blowjob and grazing his dick. She touched his back, his arms, his neck and it felt great but for some reason the skin on his dick is the problem? He didn't even come. Your husband told you everything and it's not his fault. Maybe it's weird, maybe you don't like it but move on. It was a mistake. This is so not a big deal. He's your husband, your dick, you love him, and you make him come. It was a mistake. He didn't cheat on you. You have to shrug and move past this. "

Your husband had no way of knowing that and probably thought of it as a nice gift, especially if what you say about your polyamorous tendencies is true. Sounds very much like there is a lot more than just ""slim potential"" for you to sign him up for something like this. And now you're guilting and punishing him about something *you* misunderstood. He didn't cheat on you. He didn't do anything with that masseuse, didn't even ""relieve"" himself there. He did nothing wrong here and you're behaving like a crazy person."

3,a6jc38,t2_4fxzq,Kinglink,NTA... But everyone who judged you on that ride who had a seat sucked. I believe you never have to give up your seat. They don't know your story so them trying to force you makes them suck but anyone saying you should give up your seat should have given up theirs instead. That's a pile of bullshit if you ask me... 
3,a6jc38,t2_kj4ho,SpiderRealm,"NTA. Both of them are bitches. The friend should have not taken the seat from her pregnant friend and she should have let her pregnant friend get her seat back. Their feet hurting has nothing to do with you. I'm willing to bet they do this all the time. Pregnant sits down, friend complains, pregnant gives seat to friend, pregnant complains, and pregnant gets a seat so now the both of them are sitting. Manipulative bitches. Sorry for the language."
