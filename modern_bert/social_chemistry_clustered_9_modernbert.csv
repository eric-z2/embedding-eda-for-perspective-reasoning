9,akkcpn,t2_xvrsh,SheketBevakaSTFU,"NTA. And it will get better, I promise. You'll make it through this and have an amazing life."
9,alro7y,t2_r1mj3,MarsNirgal,YTA. Why didn't you ask? It's unbelievable how many of the things in this sub could be resolved by just talking.
9,alro7y,t2_b2m2c,neonsaber,"YTA, you didn't ask her to delete them or to stop teasing about it, and them went through her phone"
9,adwxny,t2_18a48bu0,kwneumann,YTA. Moving is a big decision and most people do math and planning *before* making a big decision. So that they don't change their minds a month before the deadline. 
9,b3hq29,t2_3fnw5p6d,Zzs920,"NTA. If he is a legit friend, you should get to hang out with him. Your fiance is being overly controlling."
9,acq804,t2_2u5xpl8e,weird_flex_buto_k,NTA. Just dumb af. Your gf overreacts way too much. Also the song lyrics were so cringe she probably thinks you’re dense for not being sincere.
9,acq804,t2_p158aaz,GettingTherapy,"YTA - you try to make your mistakes sound innocent, but they could be avoided. Why in the hell would you tell your GF’s parents she smokes weed? FFS, man. I don’t know how old you are, but it’s time to grow up. "
9,amv8ew,t2_31gbxfnr,6misscamino,"NTA-Go early (don't tell anyone) give him his gift ( have him open it) give him a hug, AND LEAVE. Grandpa's been dealing with these wars longer than you, he'll understand. "
9,b3hvgo,t2_hrgdk,orangeoliviero,"NTA. Right or wrong, the front desk clerk shouldn't have been rude. Getting the manager involved to authorize the extra parking was required, but the employee should have volunteered it - ""I can see your point, but I don't have the authority to authorize that. Let me get my manager for you"""
9,b3hvgo,t2_kv520,Curiousdragon,"NTA-I think everyone should realize that when you drop 25k, you can get an extra 2 hours on the house for parking. You just educated the kid. "
9,b3hvgo,t2_3fwoqd3v,DogTaintToucher,"YTA So, your response to being told you need to pay for extra services, is that because you are already paying for services, you are entitled to others for free? I don't care what anyone has to say about that, you and anyone with this kind of mentality is an asshole."
9,b2yfsl,t2_3e83xijq,creepyrisotto,"NTA they need to make sure their dogs don't go on your property, they wouldn't like it if you went on their property without permission. "
9,b2yfsl,t2_10tlwv,SheaRVA,"NTA You told them twice (timidly or not) that their dogs were a problem and they did nothing to change it. You did exactly what you should have done by getting the HOA involved, that's what they're for."
9,b2yfsl,t2_n1med,Dachickenslaya,"NTA, that sounds awful, and that’s what an HOA is for. You can likely make an anonymous complain about it."
9,a4e58y,t2_hf0pkyb,_Scallywag,"ESH. You did go through her phone which was shitty but then you found evidence of wrongdoing. In a court of law, that evidence would be illegally obtained and thrown out..but in this situation we can't ignore reality. You have a cheater on your hands so I can't say YTA for leaving. "
9,avxz68,t2_6rj74,enna12,"NTA He's a piece of shit, but he's the one you're friends with, not her. So if you don't feel like telling her, you don't have to."
9,b6cxc3,t2_15wlwi,snxdy,"NTA. It's not like you stole someone's car to do it. Adults are allowed to travel wherever they want with whoever they want, even if that person is just themselves."
9,admbml,t2_1xmuoznt,junkfoodmama,YTA I'm seconding the depression suggestion. You need to go to therapy and if you do get divorce DO NOT PRESUE THE SISTER!! There are plenty of other driven women out there that you dont have to blow up a whole family over your selfish needs. 
9,admbml,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,"YTA. Sounds like you already know that. And you already know how this is going to pan out. She’s not going to betray her sister for you, so saying anything about it will only make your life go down in flames. Don’t. OTOH, your wife sounds depressed."
9,admbml,t2_97p55,ckjb,"NTA for feeling it, but you would be the asshole if you acted on it. Even the slightest hint to the sister is acting on it. If you want to save your relationship, get couples counselling. If you don’t, get a divorce. Either way, never say a word about your feelings for the sister to *anyone*."
9,avgy4t,t2_zrf6f,liz4prez2028,NTA. It would have probably been 100x more awkward for everyone if you said something. I think ignoring it was definitely the right choice 
9,as96jr,t2_31ofpgvg,ActivityBook,"NTA > I've calmly asked him to stop countless times but he doesn't listen. However, I don't think telling him to fuck off is right."
9,azzate,t2_3cw11gjj,BazTheBaptist,NTA. if you can't take it don't dish it out
9,azzate,t2_2b310434,ClutchyourownPearls,"NTA -- She shouldn't have said those things if she can't take it. IMO, what she said was worse. But such is life. No need to apologize. She said something bitchy, you said something similar back. But it sounds like typical mean girl stuff."
9,ay3qov,t2_1yjiygm3,Caktis,"NTA. Don’t sweat it. She’s just being immature. I enjoy the confidence you let shine when you talk about your art. Never lose that. You’re not the asshole, nor a bully. "
9,9vrn0i,t2_13imw9,Brandelyn1135,"YTA. She is your girlfriend, not your property. What makes you think she has to ask your permission to do anything? She can cut her hair, get a tattoo, wear what she likes to wear...and if you don’t like it, feel free to break up with her. What you are doing is trying to exert control. Not a good look. "
9,9vrn0i,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"YTA. 100%. It's her body and you dont need to KNOW when she does ANYTHING to it. You sound incredibly controlling and that's not okay. And even though youre claiming she doesnt need ""your permission"" you still ""had a problem"" not knowing ahead of time?"
9,9vrn0i,t2_q3e7a,Acoustag,"YTA. You're not her parent, so don't treat her like a child. I'm sure she knows exactly how permanent and important a tattoo decision is, and it's her choice to make. You said she doesn't need your permission, but you called her and asked her not to get one. Why?"
9,9vrn0i,t2_10xyw5w,RareRino,She's not your property. She has bodily autonomy and can do whatever the fuck she wants without your consent. YTA
9,ava5fh,t2_2v5seqj4,kar4256,NTA. she is a douche for asking you to raise her kids then in the same breath tell you you're unfit to parent her kids. Tell her to draft something and pick an option B if you don't agree to it. 
9,ava5fh,t2_bqcp521,ULTIMABlackstar,"NTA, tell her to get bent and either hand over the money or fuck off, dont light yourself on fire to keep others warm"
9,ava5fh,t2_3nlbwy,kuezaun,NTA. Raising 5 little kids is not an easy task. You don't owe anything to her or these kids. Sorry you're caught in the middle like this
9,ava5fh,t2_142w6u,HappyHighwayman,NTA. Not your responsibility to take care of her kids. Let her husband do it when they find him
9,ava5fh,t2_21frwxhb,IamTheDarkAgent,Sounds like the kids' father will have to step-up and take care of his kids. If you take them then he'll still have rights unless his parental rights have been terminated.
9,ava5fh,t2_873ze,DeliberateConfusion,"NTA. You've told your sister on what terms you will take in her kids. If she doesn't like it, she can find someone else to raise them."
9,ava5fh,t2_xgg9i,oscillius,YTA- because your anti-religion has become anti-family. You can dislike religion and still be there for religious family. You suck. My condolences to Ada.
9,ava5fh,t2_qhki5,SB-1,"YTA. She's dying, just tell her what she wants to hear and then do whatever you planned to do when she's gone."
9,ava5fh,t2_11djdr,WhatD0thLife,NTA if she wants them raised in a religious household so bad why not send the to their grandparents?
9,aun6qc,t2_eaioh3y,jmeach1,YTA - ONLY IF you accepted the pay it forward without argument and didnt reciprocate. Otherwise NTH. You spend your money as you pleae. You earned it. Anyone that tries to tell you what you have to do with your money sucks.
9,a8xtll,t2_ebqfpe,Watsonmolly,"NTA - everyone has bought our son Christmas gifts and it seems so unnecessary, he’s less than 2 weeks old. It seems mad to me. "
9,b6i6nc,t2_2bswm839,Skullbearer55,YTA and who the fuck cares what she calls herself? Is there so little joy in your life that this is something you're stressed over?
9,b6i6nc,t2_17v15f6,min6char,"YTA. As a general rule, unless they're literally lying, it's a bad look to tell someone what they get to call themselves."
9,b6i6nc,t2_3b7l9acc,bored_german,YTA. Why does it make you so uncomfortable that she uses the word trans? I think you have some unchecked transphobia you need to work through.
9,b41w0n,t2_17rrw5pk,shyinwonderland,"YTA, she was married to him, therefor his family became her family as well. Just because he died it doesn’t change that. "
9,b41w0n,t2_z57ya,The_baby_bat,YTA. Wtf is wrong with you??? She probably doesn't want to interact with your family because it churns out dickheads like you 
9,azbqau,t2_2t68g26,PurplePickel,"NTA, sounds like they were intentionally trying to be parasitic and guilt trip you into feeding them. People like that are the worst."
9,azbqau,t2_xkm5s,YOB1997,"NTA, they were fishing for food trying to make you seem like the asshole if you refused. You're not. They didn't even ask, they just invited themselves in. You're allowed to refuse. No is a complete sentence."
9,azbqau,t2_2kfc0ni5,LIyre,NTA Oh man I thought you were going to say that you weren't feeding your kids. Thank god that's not the case.
9,azbqau,t2_1g18u5ms,Fire_Eternity,"NTA. Jesus that was super shitty of the parents, and incredibly rude. Feed your own kids, don't just show up on a strangers doorstep and expect to be fed. "
9,azbqau,t2_2uybt93z,thunderbuttxpress,"NTA, but, as someone who grew up poor and with unstable parents, your comments on the issue makes me incredibly sad for Chris."
9,azbqau,t2_2n6t6lbw,SteveImNot,NTA for not inviting in 4 extra dinner guests YTA for suggesting your son not invite his poor friend over so much because it’s a hassle to feed him. 
9,azbqau,t2_1dvwzi9,Baby-Baphomet,"I think yta, but tbh this whole situation just makes me said. "
9,azbqau,t2_59lcd,Korrin,"YTA, but it's because you're punishing your son over making yourself feel awkward. There's nothing in your description that indicates the other family did anything wrong. It's all assumptions on your part."
9,aebth2,t2_272bc6s6,PizzaNuggies,NTA. You can dump anyone for anything. You're not obligated to continue to date someone if you feel like you'd be happier elsewhere.
9,9xgcdm,t2_7tdxh8p,BetterOutThenIn,"NTA, it's good for him to know for future cases, shes the asshole imo"
9,b67ghb,t2_3761otek,jennymccarthykillsba,YTA. Why would it be ok to skip the party if it’s for your wife. Why would you think she should be ok with that. 
9,b67ghb,t2_kw1fb,GrammarKamikaze,I'm going to say YTA but only because my dad missed my first birthday for work and always says he regrets it. Don't do that to yourself.
9,a0zmwk,t2_2kg7fx3d,groovy95,"YTA because I couldn't get halfway through your ""short and sweet"" post about what must be a bunch of below average 13 year olds."
9,a0zmwk,t2_994jo,thiscouldbemassive,YTA. A toxic racist asshole to be specific. You are the kind of gamer who makes gaming on line suck.
9,ba1fni,t2_1sjey51m,NomadicMaeve,NTA. You didn't abandon your great-grandma or anything. It's fair that you want to go home when you wern't expecting a night over.
9,arelg7,t2_8nv6j,CrnlButtcheeks,"NTA. You’re just doing what you think will be healthiest for the child. If she really doesn’t want to eat, try bargaining with her and see if you can at least get her to eat a little bit. "
9,a98kkl,t2_161h0l,FighterWoman,"NTA. You need to move on with your life, and ofcourse should you move in with your girlfriend. Your friend needs to grow up."
9,ba3zvb,t2_2urgfdhw,Erroerroerro,YTA. She's 5' tall and weighs 63kg ffs. Her bmi is not in danger at all. Mate you're always supposed to support your wife. You let your friends fat shame your wife in your own home and then doubled down and said you thought she was fat. Fuck you're a massive asshole. 
9,ba3zvb,t2_5dgpq7s,Tales_of_reddit,YTA There's something really shitty about knowing your spouse won't back you up.
9,ba3zvb,t2_bypah,ClothDiaperAddicts,YTA. You don’t agree with your buddies when they call your wife fat as an insult. You shut that down because she’s your wife and they are disrespecting her by laughing over her size/weight/shape. Your friends are also assholes. 
9,ba3zvb,t2_1hpot4wa,roarlikealady,"YTA here. Spouses stick up for their spouses, especially on topics like this. And it sounds like you are making wild assumptions about how your wife feels in her own body. "
9,ba3zvb,t2_1628qf01,OrangeSockMonkey,"YTA. You and your friends made fun of her, called her fat, and when she confronted you about it, your response was that she isn't thin."
9,ba3zvb,t2_tcwbi7,brandyto,YTA. You made fun of your with with your friends in her home. How do you have to ask random internet strangers if you are The Asshole in this situation?
9,ba3zvb,t2_1el9lspw,susiebubbles,"YTA for allowing your friends to say something like that about your wife, piling in on it then doubling down on it when your wife was upset by it. She might seem like she's over it but I'd wager she isn't and she won't forget it either. Your friends should apologise as well."
9,ba3zvb,t2_3dyrylw0,GinTrouble,"YTA One, your wife isn’t fat. Two, you let your asshole friends make asshole comments about your wife and just agreed with them? You are definitely the asshole. "
9,ba3zvb,t2_dyvnz,OnTheSlope,"lol, I'm probably going to be the only NTA here, but what should you be expected to do? Lie? You didn't mean for her to hear it. Maybe you needed to treat the situation as if she was in the room already? fuck if i know."
9,b7gf0q,t2_2mujmsi8,laralye,NTA there is a reason why he's preying on a 17 year old and your friend shouldn't stick around to find out. 
9,b6kwb4,t2_i179ola,HannahToddy,NTA. Doesn’t matter what they speak in. It’s inappropriate! Yes it’s probably something she does to help her with stress. But she shouldn’t get away with it if it’s in another language.
9,b6kwb4,t2_21frwxhb,IamTheDarkAgent,NTA - If she is that unhappy with her job she should be working elsewhere.
9,b6kwb4,t2_dn9au,Swiollvfer,"NTA. If you don't want her fired, don't report her to her manager, tho. IMHO this would be the most likely outcome. Maybe tell her something like ""a lot of people who don't look Korean can actually understand Korean""? (in Korean)"
9,b6kwb4,t2_3ar6a8qv,buttgrabbin,NTAshe just hates her job You should let her insult you again in korean and then ask her if she wants you to get her manager but say it in korean
9,b6kwb4,t2_2wmq2tyd,annoyed68,NTA Honestly just say it to her face. It’ll spook her ass real good to know you’ve been listening in on her “private” venting this whole time. 
9,b6kwb4,t2_12avm2h4,jer1230,"NTA - but oooooo If i were you, i would’ve very much enjoyed responding to her in Korean and that would’ve checked her ass "
9,b6kwb4,t2_3h047o88,Lizlizlizzyliz,"NTA. Just to really clarify, you won’t be putting her at the risk of getting her fired. Her behavior did that. You making the behavior known is not the problem. "
9,b6kwb4,t2_14185y,SailorMarch,"NTA but next time you need to defend yourself, seriously. You wouldn’t be thought of as a bitch if you responded to what she had said. "
9,b6kwb4,t2_2rgno31v,Ejjdkdjdjdkdkw,NTA duh Though it would be funny if a customer could understand it - the cashier would be on reddit posting on r/TIFU for getting fired.
9,b6kwb4,t2_3a2j0phm,InsightFrisbee,NTA - that’s super rude. But as you’re not looking to get her fired you should confront her in Korean - that shock and embarrassment will surely make her rethink her behavior :)
9,b6kwb4,t2_2bwdmrkt,vipul172,NTA. She is being a asshole for being rude. What if somebody knows korean and hears her? Their first step would be to report her.
9,b6kwb4,t2_7861nye,poptart_divination,"I'm gonna say YTA. You knew what she was saying. You made eye contact. She stopped talking shit and avoided your gaze. It sounds like she got the hint that you understood her. If she does it again, tell her boss. But I know if I were her, I'd watch what I say around people after that. "
9,avujoj,t2_xv636,ex-inteller,NTA. She's non-communicative. She can't expect you to read her mind the one time she has a real reason for being an asshole.
9,avujoj,t2_z0h6d,misswrenbird,"NTA. You had every right to be annoyed that she didn’t show again, and had no way of knowing something was going on because she didn’t tell you. "
9,b01xst,t2_3y4bf,shamechisel,NTA - it sounds like your girlfriend was jealous and was being insecure. I would go to another meet-up.
9,b01xst,t2_2uyazqs,PcsArePeopleToo,NTA. Don't let her reaction ruin this great experience for you. You thought of her during it and tried to bring her into the conversation and that should be enough.
9,b01xst,t2_1cgbri2t,Yenny1104,"NTA wtf it’s not like she was the bride in a wedding, what overshadowing can one do at a fucking bar meet up. "
9,b01xst,t2_2fhpp6z1,thebirbs,"NTA. She wants you to be social, she should get used to sharing the spotlight. She should be happy her friends are getting to know you. "
9,b01xst,t2_1j9g4ewu,cnw19,NTA. There was a topic you enjoyed and it’s not like you took over HER conversation. I agree you just took her pep talk and ran with it! Congrats for feeling comfortable in a social setting! 
9,b01xst,t2_1ujofibo,JillParrish77,NTA but she is! Good grief how rude that you finally come out of your shell & she chastises you like a child for it. 
9,b01xst,t2_5e8nc,Torger083,"NTA. Ditch her and keep the friends. Joking aside, it’s not cool of her to try and diminish what was a big social accomplishment for you. "
9,b01xst,t2_2iun29gy,Donnyboi69,"NTA, your girl should be more happy at the fact that you were social instead of getting mad that you ""overshadowed"" her. "
9,b01xst,t2_l5i0773,Suicideinsilence22,"NTA What is wrong with her?! You have social anxiety and she knows about it, then when you try to have a conversation with someone she is mad at you? she is defienetly the asshole here."
9,b01xst,t2_1266cj,onlinesecretservice,NTA - she asked and got more than she bargained for what a slug! Very ugly of her. 
9,b01xst,t2_1xtd9gx2,Cent1234,"NTA Sounds to me like she's trying to 'fix' you, and you've just demonstrated that you don't need 'fixing.'"
9,b01xst,t2_xnzpe,roqueofspades,"INFO: did you interrupt or talk over her, or talk for far longer than anyone cared? if not then NTA"
9,ayvmw6,t2_2pg70np3,Exiled_From_Twitter,"NTA - ppl who try to game the system can't cry foul when they're caught, no matter how they're caught. Fair game. "
9,ay6cj0,t2_3cjdzjnm,covertassembly,NTA Very suspicious. Sounds like he is hiding it tbh. Like if he says drop it. Id ask why wont u post a pic of us Maybe post a pic of u 2 and tag him in it. He gets mad....CHEATINNN. Jk but seriously its fishy
9,ay6cj0,t2_mkqyw,sparklaw,NTA. And you should get a new boyfriend. I bet your next boyfriend doesn’t have to asked to put you and him photos on Instagram. 
9,a95aw2,t2_1xri6p3r,lunar_lena,"NTA. He agreed to go. So now he has to go. Whether it's church or not is irrelevant, he made a commitment to do something, so now he has to do it. End of story."
9,aq066o,t2_1jwmj4,Social_Ascetic,YTA - It's a San Pedro cactus. You can buy those legally. See them all the time at home garden stores. You blew this out of proportion off of one person's response on Reddit. 
9,artjjm,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,"NTA. By working on meth, he's putting safety at risk. If he fucks up, someone could die. By having it in the vehicle, he's putting you at risk. He's suggested you steal things. Report him for sure."
9,b94tbi,t2_34moz5tm,LikeTheColor93,"NTA, just be polite and don’t do it in front of others"
9,b0kall,t2_1mmrlkec,smakchat,NTA. He's annoying and basically casting you in the role of a nag because he feels like eating with his hands and throwing things on the floor... 
9,b0kall,t2_21mo3yfx,wwwooowwwzzzaaa,NTA You're not acting like a mom. He is acting like a child. You are calling him out on acting like a child. Man-babies are far more annoying than real babies.
9,b0kall,t2_dn9au,Swiollvfer,"NTA. > I treat him like a five year old Apparently he needs it, since he doesn't realize basic *living together* rules."
9,b0kall,t2_14mgwl,TheRealJetlag,"NTA someone acting like a 5 year old but doesn’t like being treated like a 5 year old... oh, the irony. "
9,b0kall,t2_1ygiy2zl,misiepatysie,Going against the majority here but... YTA. You can expect him to clean after himslef but why on earth do you mind if he is eating with cuttlery or with his hands? -
9,b0kall,t2_7za20,Prince-Lee,"NTA. He sounds like a fucking slob. Do you clean up after him? If so, please stop. That’s be one way to have him be more responsible. Or maybe not. He doesn’t sound very respectful at all."
9,b5lqc1,t2_1wgoxii5,DisneyBride28, NTA it's not your job to police your friend's actions. And you shouldn't have to drop one of your closest friends over a mistake he made. People fuck up. We don't just ditch them. 
9,b5lqc1,t2_2jn393l0,PossibleCook,NTA. Jon is the real a-hole here and your wife kind of sucks for trying to put you in a situation that you’re not a part of. 
9,b5lqc1,t2_2tgifvb1,badlilbishh,NTA- Jon is the asshole for putting you in this position and cheaters suck. But he’s still your friend and if you don’t want to drop him that’s your choice. Obviously your not condoning his cheating because you called him an idiot for it but he’s still your friend. 
9,acrtv1,t2_751y9,lkantra,NTA of course. But this break is a breakup. He’s keeping you on the back burner just in case. Don’t let him do that. Cut it off. 
9,azyhvk,t2_ai98rxh,KaanBickin,"NTA No one likes getting interrupted, so your reaction was very civil, and his was very childish."
9,azyhvk,t2_2v1p36y2,unpopular-aye-aye,"NTA You were trying to stand up for yourself and did so politely. No one has the right to screen in your face. Your mother should have stood up for you there. If it were me, I would expect an apology though I doubt you'll get one."
9,abyygl,t2_x88w1,RoseDreams,"Nta... unless you think you might get back with your ex, then yta. Otherwise, you are single and free to do what you want. "
9,abyygl,t2_ljd67,PhantomGeass,"NTA she is your ex, and she can go fuck herself. You have no obligation to care about her feelings anymore. "
9,af02nn,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,YTA. You only want him back because he's with someone else. Six months won't change his potential for a relationship with your parents.
9,af02nn,t2_zali1n,SantaPachaMama,YTA . A manipulative horrible person. You need to gtfo and away from him. Don't fuck with his new life. Go grow up and mature. Don't end up in r/nicegirls. 
9,af02nn,t2_r1mj3,MarsNirgal,"YTA. Don't put this on him. If letting him go was a mistake, own it and live with it, don't try to ruin his life a second time out of selfishness."
9,ay3hi1,t2_1xytpzcl,Sphel_,"NTA, guy needs to learn to take a hint, be careful it wasn't some sort of scam tho, he could have been a distraction whilst a second guy stole something from you "
9,ay3hi1,t2_awff2,CatherineConstance,"NTA. Wtf dude you should NOT feel bad about this. You didn't owe him anything, not even a response to his first question. It's nice of you to want to help but you couldn't, and he should have stopped WAY before he did. Maybe he is down on his luck, maybe not, but either way it is NOT your problem."
9,ay3hi1,t2_udmac,Hunterofshadows,YTA I think you were justified in yelling at the guy but yelling at someone isn’t necessary 
9,arskny,t2_oz5b8,thepuppylife,NTA. This isn't going to change. Get a boyfriend who doesn't have mommy issues. This will be a battle you'll forever fight AND LOSE. It's not your job to make your S.O see the light. 
9,arskny,t2_2z4cj0jm,IgotCarasma,"NTA It sounds like you're dating Howard from Big Bang Theory. As long as you two live in the same town as she's in, you'll always be the ""other woman"". Yeesh! Good luck."
9,9xssts,t2_6r80u,Joyrock,"Not only NTA, but good on you for taking the fight to her and making it extremely clear what she did wrong. "
9,9xssts,t2_175929,redditKMC,"NTA at all - if someone I knew did this, I would also chew them out and never talk to them again. Kick her to the curb and never look back."
9,9xssts,t2_wapd6bo,HalfPintMarmite,"You're not the asshole for breaking up with your girlfriend, but sending five paragraphs ripping into her is a bit of an asshole move. So.... NTA, all up."
9,b8ukxy,t2_1sq23q8l,highesthouse,"NTA Bigotry is never okay; I don’t care who you are. I respect others’ free speech, but that doesn’t mean that bigotry doesn’t deserve to be shamed by the whole of society. You’re never going to be an asshole for telling a bigot to stop spewing bigotry around you."
9,b8ukxy,t2_12ezy51w,laik72,"NTA, it may be the only way to retain a relationship with him. But I hope maybe you can find a way to turn him around instead of leaving him isolated in front of the talking heads."
9,b20eo5,t2_em0jjbu,thither_and_yon,YTA. The number of men on reddit who think that a wife being a SAHM is an excuse to treat her like a child rather than a partner is truly astounding. 
9,9v2shd,t2_994jo,thiscouldbemassive,"Absolutely NTA. Your mom is being a brat because she wants some social attention and you denied it to her. But it's not her baby, and it's not her body. Frankly putting your foot down and asserting your boundaries is a good thing, before she starts getting too entitled. She'll get over it."
9,9v2shd,t2_2jx08z57,ElisabethHornswoggle,NTA. But maybe you can compromise and do something with her to make her happy. Perhaps frame a copy of the ultrasounds and give them as a gift to your mum :) 
9,9v2shd,t2_uut6mxm,Kraw24,"I mean YNTA, I completely feel you.. but I guess it’s your mom. I’d bite the bullet and just let her be excited, it’s definitely better than her being depressed, right?"
9,aqf7kc,t2_1cfog012,earthymama826,"NTA - I'm biased here. That's one of my biggest pet peeves. I'm forever chasing my child around with a tissue screaming about ""STOP SUCKING SNOT UP INTO YOUR BRAIN"" which is neither anatomically correct nor a level headed, calm response. Oh well. No one is perfect. 😂"
9,asy9pq,t2_2o1jkelk,falketyfalke,NTA. She's gaming the system. Good on you for calling her on it and for taking care of your true friends when you can. 
9,aej8eu,t2_u82k6,queenofthera,"YTA There's nothing unreasonable about talking to your friend on the phone for that long, (and your partner is being a bit of an asshole for making you feel weird about it), BUT you should be making time to say goodnight to your son every night. "
9,aej8eu,t2_1sdpwp,mrbnlkld,She's YTA - you responded to her but by text. She should respond to you by text clearly stating what it is she wants. Instead she is passive aggressive.
9,9x5xkv,t2_j6cwi,vermonsterskibum,NTA given the fact that your brother is an asshole and the fact that he did that to your mom made me laugh so fucking hard
9,9x5xkv,t2_g7qyrmf,Obscurian,"NTA. He's old enough to be considerate of you, or at least old enough to LOOK AROUND THE PARKING LOT FOR YOU! Let him walk home if he's so impatient. Like what, he can't even wait ten minutes? What a brat!"
9,ao0dam,t2_j3usfmy,toshido22,"No NTA at all. Sorry but your husband and his daughter are crazy. Your stepdaughter is a garbage human. He wants to divorce you because you don't want to watch your adult, nurse, stepdaughter kill her dad/your husband. Especially after all the stuff you did to take care of him right after his heart attack. Wow married into the Crazies eh?"
9,arytq5,t2_lgncd0m,booksgnome,YTA. He was clearly already handling the situation. He wasn't hiding your existence or using her to inflate his own ego. He probably didn't tell you because he knew you would push the boundary. 
9,arytq5,t2_qnotl4,saymynamebastien,"YTA. Even though you guys have agreed to look through each other's phones, that doesn't mean you get to block whoever you want. I understand being worried about the texts from another girl, but it's not your decision to make. "
9,arytq5,t2_25y53b53,InTheBinIGo,YTA. He was handling it and probably could have blocked her himself if he wanted to. Also you guys sounds very young... dang
9,arytq5,t2_2djri0qu,satanhandshake,"YTA. That's wildly inappropriate and a huge invasion of personal space and privacy. I hope you're 16, you have some growing to do."
9,axyz94,t2_304sd7im,owlcityy,NTA but grow a pair and block him. You’re not obligated to talk or meet up with a person you’ve never met. 
9,acci3e,t2_lyzk3,PianoJkprd001,"NTA, but you gave him a choice and he simply chose the one you didn't want. If you didn't think you could handle the breakup, you shouldn't of given him an ultimatum."
9,9ypl3q,t2_6yuaf,Viperbunny,NTA. Your child is having issues. Having electronics is a privilege. He showed he is not deserving of the privilege. I highly recommend getting your son into therapy. It sounds like he is going through a lot. 
9,9ypl3q,t2_8uvxq,aslokaa,NTA and I am just wondering if you can still do an extremely late abortion on him.
9,9ypl3q,t2_g8eieik,LovelyShark,YTA for violating his privacy and destroying property. He likely is not dealing with his mother's passing well. He needs counseling. Please get him help. 
9,9ydhdy,t2_9suyu,Shutsman,"This has to be fake, no one is this fucking stupid, obviously YTA"
9,9zec50,t2_1xan3y53,ddevarah,NTA. She could've asked you nicely and you still wouldn't have been obligated to go out of your way to help her out.
9,9zec50,t2_9eti3,KatFrog,NTA You are not required to give her a ride because she asked. She's being an asshole by trying to make you feel guilty.
9,auj823,t2_ibmc0,HereticalMessiah,YTA - I get why you hid it. But you took an extremely insecure individuals source of comfort because you don’t like the way it looks on her. That’s an asshole move. 
9,auj823,t2_2sw4bedd,actualdisasterbi,YTA You stole her hoodie and are refusing to give it back just because you don't like the way it looks. How could you be anything but an asshole?
9,auj823,t2_2dhwv9h,sqitten,"YTA You stole her things. If you can't accept her for who she is, break up with her. But don't steal something you know means a lot to her. I mean, don't steal anything at all, but it's especially bad when you know how much it means to her."
9,auj823,t2_1sq23q8l,highesthouse,"YTA She’s right when she tells you that she decides what she wears. If you don’t like it, she’s under no obligation to change it. That doesn’t give you the right to steal her property, especially if it’s a source of security for her."
9,auj823,t2_1992ynkl,ETanny,YTA 100% You cant hide your girlfriends clothes just because you dont like it. That is very VERY controlling. How would you feel if you found out your girlfriend hid your favourite things because she didn't like it. 
9,auj823,t2_2zzny26f,heavvy_metal_cowboy,"YTA. Look, it's obviously a comfort item. If she has anxiety, or is on the autism spectrum, losing something like that could be catastrophic. "
9,auj823,t2_187xb4p3,soulangelic,YTA. It’s pretty low to steal something from someone you claim to love just because you don’t like the way it looks on her.
9,auj823,t2_34uie20s,FoxesInSweaters,YTA And she probably needs therapy. This reminds me of the peanuts kid who needs the blanket. There are better ways of going about this.
9,auj823,t2_35b6ghn3,trekmystars,YTA. She would not let you control what she wears so you stole from her???? Like wtf if I was dating you this would be a major red flag. 
9,auj823,t2_1b1torqv,Spider4Hire,"YTA - Jesus Christ, is this the first opportunity you have had in your life that you thought you could actually control? I can't wait for her to find out that you had it all along so that she can move on without you."
9,am5vvx,t2_2oieak1j,M3talguitari5t,"NTA. She’s one. If there was no party at all, her life would be the exact same. "
9,am5vvx,t2_mmlsel1,TheOneWhosCensored,NTA. Tell anyone that complains they’re more than welcome to pay for the party if they want it so bad. 
9,andd11,t2_wm2tl0o,SaraMWR,NTA. Your feelings are your feelings. And he was definitely the AH for not talking to you about it. Plus his parents should stay out of your business altogether 
9,b5als3,t2_dn9au,Swiollvfer,"YTA. > ""You guys are cool, don't come to school tomorrow"". This is some serious shit, you don't joke about it. Yes, the director lying is ugly, but I still believe you were a way bigger and insensitive asshole here."
9,b5als3,t2_8ujng,masterbogarter,"YTA. Joking about committing a school shooting is never ok. You did a stupid thing, a thoughtless thing, and you paid the price for it. "
9,a0ik2l,t2_pcitxcd,Wikidess,"YTA - even if she doesn't have a disease and she's just fat, you're still the asshole."
9,a0ik2l,t2_nifw8d9,AkumaWitch,"YTA. dont fight fire with more fire and gasoline, fight fire with water and put it out. you dont have to be an ass to an asshole, it just makes you mean and immature just like her. "
9,a0ik2l,t2_2n9vl9zh,Darkrixe,NTA maybe you could of gone about that better but she was always complaining so she had it coming
9,a0ik2l,t2_tdmua6d,Hans_Micheal,NTA. Not nice to call her fat and all that but if what you said about her bullying an autistic kid than she had it coming.
9,algye5,t2_1n5l08g1,eLECTRICSHEEP83,"NTA. Do parents actually expect kids to pamper them with presents? Make her a card that says something like ""My love is like this card. It's free, and the expression on your face right now is priceless."" "
9,algye5,t2_zbqdu,eb_straitvibin,"NTA but make her a card or something man, your mom doesn’t care if you spend lots of money, she wants to know you care "
9,algye5,t2_hdk2j,regularforcesmedic,"NTA. I think this kinda borders on a SHP, but okay. Your Christmas and birthday money is a gift to you to spend on yourself. It's weird and selfish for her to ask you to spend it on her birthday."
9,axgfkm,t2_27fzqdrd,LeadSheep,"NTA. That dude should understand that your brother has other necessities. And like you said, he could get up earlier so that way he won't be late. I would say NTA, he deserved it."
9,axgfkm,t2_1u1h50f2,piximelon,"NTA, I mean sure you could have responded in a more respectful manner, but why would you give this guy respect when he doesn’t show your brother any? "
9,ajth1w,t2_2fqarc7y,livvy_17,YTA - You have no right to meddle in someone else’s personal business or their lives. Don’t insert yourself into others drama. 
9,ajth1w,t2_21hjk8jb,jelliebaby51,YTA - it was not your place to tell him that. If she wanted him to know she’d have told him. What a breach of her trust. 
9,ajth1w,t2_1czr04,Orange_Paisley,"YTA. It really wasn't your business or your place. For the record I agree that she should tell him and tell him her plans, but ultimately it's not really his decision since it is her body."
9,ajth1w,t2_gitkg,pm_me_your_molars,"YTA. If someone doesn't want to tell their partner that they're getting an abortion, that's their choice. Men can do really stupid and awful things when they disagree with their partner's decision to abort."
9,b1wti7,t2_14tuie,Noobzorg,"NTA. People saying you would be the asshole probably do shit like this themselves. These are your friends, if you have any respect for the guy you should tell him. Bring on the hate."
9,b1wti7,t2_130yxx,abitdark,"NTA, I would tell him. I know most of my friends would not be ok with that behavior. "
9,afl5g8,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,"NTA. Your personal computer is not his work computer. If he needs to back something up, he's welcome to use DropBox or something similar. He can buy an external hard drive if necessary."
9,afl5g8,t2_33mtsqk,SykoSarah,"NTA, he has a laptop he can use, so why did he even want to use yours in the first place? "
9,afl5g8,t2_r1mj3,MarsNirgal,NTA. And I can't even understand why he wants this. I would be terrified to give access to my work information to somebody else's computer. 
9,av4bff,t2_yukgan7,unlucky_dominator_,"YTA He was there first, the fact that you and all of your friends sat down and still needed space is not his problem. "
9,b267q0,t2_e2mfy,firenoodles,NTA. Labor is not a spectator's sport. In the future I have a feeling you will have to be very firm on setting boundaries with your Mom. Good luck.
9,b267q0,t2_f7v97,Bobalery,"NTA. You will NEVER be an asshole for respecting your wife’s wishes while she is birthing your child. Lesson learned about your uncle though- if you tell him sensitive information that shouldn’t be spread around, you need to make that crystal clear to him."
9,b267q0,t2_g7knv1f,jolie178923-15423435,"NTA you and your wife are on the same page, and you two are the only people that matter here."
9,b267q0,t2_vlrj3c3,Witheer,"NTA, her birth her rules, she doesn’t want people there shouldn’t be any."
9,azvhsx,t2_p1u7v5b,lucifertheecat,"YTA Its common decency to hold the door for the person behind you until they hold it, also you kinda sound like a asshole, people aren't expecting you to be a doorman, its just being nice."
9,atksbr,t2_1397v7,TrainerJayden14,NTA but you should just tell her. Nothing stopping her from doing the same thing once she’s in a new place. Being sad isn’t an excuse to not have to face your mistakes. 
9,atksbr,t2_2uhbkf30,ryanjamessez,NTA. Tell her she shouldn't be in charge of anything until she takes charge of herself.
9,atksbr,t2_17fd9n,Omega_Maru,"NTA. Thats animal abuse. She cant treat a dog the same way she treats a rabbit. Suggest maybe getting a different animal that can stay in a cage, like a hamster"
9,awiyrq,t2_2tm2gxjx,Ann-von-Beaverhausen,NTA. He made the baby too - he should be there to help and support you when they arrive.
9,b6mjur,t2_glp7xoq,seminarysmooth,"NAH if you don’t have the funds to cover the stay. YTA if you explored air bnb’s and couldn’t get a cheaper rate. If the cost of the hotel and getting yourself cleaned up is the reason you’re not buying a gift then def YTA. FWIW, you have a year to send a gift. "
9,9z7xes,t2_2bedmliu,4LokoButtHash,NTA because feelings don't make you an asshole. Actions do. If you were to tell her you could phrase it a lot better though than how you wanted to say it. 
9,b47upj,t2_pf0c0o2,rebeccavt,"Did you seriously keep a tally of his half of the groceries, etc? So petty. YTA. He’s your husband and you share your finances. It’s all a wash in the end. It sounds like you just want something to hold over him. "
9,b2y0bw,t2_4uil9,xHeero,NAH. Ask her for the pass back like a normal person would. This can change to NTA (her being the asshole) if she doesn't give it back or acts bad about it.
9,b2y0bw,t2_37w2pyaf,Not-The-Asshole,"YTA. Your mom bought it for her, not you. You can't have it ""back"" because it was never yours"
9,b35dsc,t2_3bfxf0gf,1_Justbreakup,"NTA, you may not be a 15 year old girl but it sure sounds like you are dating a 15 year old boy "
9,b35dsc,t2_snwpo,LilMeemz,"NTA, leave him! immediately! Red flag! Just kidding, but it does seem like a weird thing to get bent out of shape over. Probably best to just chalk it up to being a quirk of his. "
9,aqpujl,t2_1fa79a,bmf09598,"NTA. Hopefully he steps in it and realizes that if you want a dog, you have to actually clean up after it"
9,aqpujl,t2_z0tkn,SimAlienAntFarm,"YTA: but the best kind of asshole, the kind that is correct"
9,aqpujl,t2_5xaao,RiflemanLax,NTA Buy a poop scoop and repeat over and over until it stops.

9,aqpujl,t2_384jfc8b,Wild_plasser,NTA. Would it be better to speak to them directly? Maybe. Or maybe they're the kind of asshole who would be even worse afterwards. 
9,aqpujl,t2_c8wjd,joshb44231,"You’re NTA. It’s not fair that you have to worry about stepping in dog shit because your neighbor is a selfish, self-centered asshole who only cares about himself. "
9,aqpujl,t2_fn2kz6y,Locogreen,NTA. They need to pick up the poop. You were nice enough to leave it in a bag.
9,aqpujl,t2_14v1df,Goongagalunga,"NTA Put it in a paper bag next time, light it on fire and watch to see if the old man calls the shit poop."
9,aqpujl,t2_vcl37,Pugontoast,"YTA If you have to ask is it ok to handle faeces in order to exact revenge, the answer is YTA. But he’s the WAY bigger ass hole, dog is the real victim here just trying to poop in peace. "
9,apk6ll,t2_qtbd5,Malbethion,YTA. If you don't have the sort of relationship where telling the boss to fuck off is okay then you need to get a grip on your temper.
9,apk6ll,t2_2q00q9do,accountno_infinity,"YTA. You need to work on your anger management. You get frustrated, that’s a fact - but people don’t have to put up with the way you express it."

9,apk6ll,t2_mt3lw,RemoveTheTop,"YTA. Of course you're the asshole, you acknowledge you have anger managment issues, and you took them out on him."
9,apk6ll,t2_5nu5a,Simon_Magnus,"YTA - You were just angry because things weren't going your way in the activity you were taking part in. It doesn't make you a bad person, but you should apologize for it."
9,apk6ll,t2_9ter4,ncolaros,"YTA. Apologize to him, and tell him you were just having a bad day. If he's a normal person, he'll accept and move on. I think you might have taken an normal comment as a slight because you were already angry. "
9,atvjvo,t2_202ja20u,kellie0105,Nta. Finishing your plate is an unhealthy eating habit and I will fight to the death over anyone telling my kids to finish their plate. Regardless of the reason.

9,atvjvo,t2_1wfbhafu,learningprof24,NTA. I would actually tell your mom she can't see him again until SHE apologises to him for her insensitivity and riaking his health.
9,atvjvo,t2_27ajcae2,amandae123,NTA: your mom should not feed him anything he’s allergic to. Good for him for standing up for himself. 
9,atvjvo,t2_62xsz,happythoughts413,"NTA. The “clean your plate” thing is just a power play, which sucks. Your parenting shouldn’t revolve around showing off how much you can force a child to do. Also, he’s ALLERGIC. It doesn’t matter if it doesn’t send him into full anaphylactic shock. No one “owes” someone the right to force them to feel bad."
9,atvjvo,t2_2szhxxgd,amethystjade15,NTA. Agree with everyone else that your mother is. He’s only kind of allergic? That’s still shitty. And your son is only an asshole if he responded with “I’m not gonna eat this and also I hope you die!” while flipping the table. 
9,atvjvo,t2_mxijq,Random_act_of_Random,NTA - How can you possibly think you are the asshole here. Your son is taking care of his own illness and your mom is trying to hurt him. I'm glad your son took a stand and I would reward that behavior.

9,atvjvo,t2_nuggwxa,Dalamas2001,NTA. You're mom is a horrible excuse for a human being and you should cut her out if your life entirely. If you ever the chance to pull the plug do so immediately.

I can have cooked, but it has to be thoroughly cooked. &#x200B; You have a 5 year old who can tell an adult what he is allergic to and refuse to eat it. That is a WIN! Seriously, the number of young children who don't really know what they are allergic to is astounding, so WTG MUM!"
9,atvjvo,t2_84zl86s,Humanity_Why,"NTA. jeez, your mom is a whole entire asshole though. I understand that the allergy isnt super sever, but he'll still have a reaction and therefore rightfully doesnt want to inflict that on himself. I can't believe she'd try to!"
9,atvjvo,t2_8rrjj,Xannin,"NTA. I wouldn't force an adult to eat something they're mildly allergic to, so I wouldn't force a child to do it either."
9,atvjvo,t2_i6cwn34,rayraywest0,NTA you’d think as a grandmother she’d want to avoid causing your son pain. Please don’t let her cook for him anymore.

9,atvjvo,t2_ttks5ss,Boba_Kun,NTA - Your son should be able to refuse to consume any food even slightly detrimental to his health. Just because it doesn't kill you doesn't mean you should consume it. 
9,atvjvo,t2_310tfvv9,katmeowness88,"NTA For crying out loud, HE IS ALLERGIC! Your mother is the one that needs to apologize. It sounds like she just has to be ""right"", even if she knows she's wrong. She is the AH here "

9,atvjvo,t2_15l2thbw,Ariyanwrynn1989,NTA and your moms a b*tch. An allergic reaction is an allergic reaction. How can you knowingly and willingly want to give a kid something you know hes allergic to just because it wont kill him? 
9,atvjvo,t2_x0asa,Robinleighan,NTA my kids are allowed to say “no” to things at 2 and 3 yo and my FIL thinks I’m a shit mom for it but... They have a basic understanding of boundaries. I think you’re good! 
9,atvjvo,t2_nb5zb,reptilesni,NTA. You should read the reddit post about the grandmother who put coconut oil in her granddaughter's hair even though she was allergic to it before you decide if she can babysit again.
9,atvjvo,t2_35b6ghn3,trekmystars,NTA. Your son does not need to apologize for not eating something that he is allergic to. 
9,atvjvo,t2_xzcum,cobaltcontrast,"NTA Smart kid. Please rub this in her face. When he says he's allergic, she needs to listen to him. She needs to swallow her narcissism I mean pride. Respect and protect that kid. "

9,atvjvo,t2_ipwqx,Fishface248,NTA. You mom is so far in the wrong here. He is 5. If her ego cannot handle a 5 year old (rightfully) talking back then she obviously has issues she needs to work out. 
9,atvjvo,t2_u6tzr,regularshowman1,"NTA, obviously. Of course your son shouldn’t have to eat food he’s allergic to, and of course he shouldn’t have to apologize for not eating said food."

9,atvjvo,t2_ztc9r,kittymctacoyo,NTA at all but your mother is being a huge asshole. You’re doing the right thing teaching your son autonomy and that he has rights etc. This is very important. Your mother should know better all around.

9,atvjvo,t2_pwuxh,JohnnyTT314,YTA. You have kids but then they are their own person. Let them decide to apologize or not. Sounds like you have hung on waaaaay to long. 
9,atvjvo,t2_h8iu1p9,twiliteshadow2,NTA! My son has the same rules and it's only people who don't understand that think it's ok. Your mother should be the one to apologize because she won't respect her grandson. Keep it up your being a great mom. 
9,atvjvo,t2_10jany,rabidbadger6,"NTA what the absolute fuck? If someone is allergic to something, even if it’s minor, you can’t try to make them eat it, that’s horrid"
9,atvjvo,t2_13ox7t,plain_wallflower,"NTA per se, but you should talk to your son that the way he spoke with your mother is not acceptable."
9,atvjvo,t2_bch9f,pinksultana,NTA wow if your mum wants the privilege of having a relationship with her grandson she can respect his allergies and avoid everything that affects him at all! She should apologise to him! 
9,atvjvo,t2_kbt18,TheSimbaNinja,"NTA - Your mum just wholly tried to poison your son just to teach him a lesson by the sounds of it, Jesus Christ."
9,atvjvo,t2_146dz4,Prune_Boy,NTA. So she wants you to apologize for trying to give your son something that would literally harm him? The fuck?
9,atvjvo,t2_k8tzfc,butteredhobbit,NTA! The real AH is your mother fir trying to make your son poison himself! FUCK THAT! As someone with allergies - including food allergies - those who make food for me can die mad about it if I refuse to poison myself.
9,atvjvo,t2_ehvk2,ChasingKills,NTA She is hella evil hives are no joke and she expects him just to deal with it.
9,atvjvo,t2_6c7jc,IndyDude11,"NTA, but if your son was disrespectful in his reply, he should apologize, even if he was right. Sometimes it’s how you say something that can offend more than what you are saying. "
9,atvjvo,t2_28np7iy7,whats_it_to_you77,"YTA. You should not let your son speak to his grandmother that way. He should apologize for how he refused, not for the act of refusing. You owe her an apology too. She keeps him for you to go to work--I'm sure you don't pay her and then you complain about her. Ungrateful. "
9,b5x6fk,t2_1ix4h2xo,SilverDirt,"NTA 14 and 15 are NOT kids. If they cant be trusted home alone then something is wrong, and if she simply cant leave them home alone she needs to get the fuck over herself. Theyre not children, theyre young adults."
9,b21clr,t2_t0gra,Rivka333,"NTA. And being-uninterested-in-sex isn't assholish, but it sounds like she was an asshole in how she responded to you when you tried to talk about it."

9,b6xp4k,t2_dbelct0,cat_person_,"NTA. Your parents are using you. And then, when you put your foot down, they are trying to guilt you into allowing them to use you some more. You do NOT need to insure another car for your dad. Stay strong."
9,b6xp4k,t2_ipdjwal,star_guardian_carol,NTA - I'm sorry your parents are treating you this way. This is not how this should be. Healthy relationship boundaries are something that are seriously needed here for your sake. J wouldn't feel bad at all keeping them away from you like you have. 
9,b6xp4k,t2_28dk2fkj,Delanes_Brain,NTA: you aren't the narcissist but you sure were r/raisedbynarcissists. You don't owe them anything and they've done nothing but use you. Stay away.

9,awfjwp,t2_kssq4,BSnIA,"NTA. NTA. NTA. You tried to be the good friend, and she went the cowardly-family breaking-selfish--way. Speaks volumes about her character. Yes the man is at fault, and is a POS, but she is still wrong on so many levels. You did the right thing. Sucks losing a friend, but you are NTA. "
9,b9zrc4,t2_3jrx0q2u,ClapBackRat,"NTA - given the history it is definitely the right thing to do to 100% cut her out. If he cannot do this, he values her more than he does you."
9,b9zrc4,t2_31uqrglr,heheok1,"NTA. YOU deserve better but if you both really want to heal this relationship, then you both need to get rid of toxicity. If that is her, then she has to go far far away. But if your husband doesn't think the same, then you need to rethink your priorities. "
9,b9zrc4,t2_z4p0t,icingnsprinkles,NTA he’s lucky you forgave him and that should have been a show of good faith from day 1. You’re better than me! 
9,b9zrc4,t2_ba06p,FrankGoreStoleMyBike,YTA for subjecting your son to a dying relationship instead of making a clean break with a serial cheater. 
9,at0h5c,t2_46blzib,Abeyita,"NTA - it's not that you don't want to drive, it would be dumb to drive since you need the money. "
9,arnjb9,t2_1l13k6to,helen790,"YTA, for basically everything besides splitting the bill. That was pretty much the only non-asshole thing in this post."
9,arnjb9,t2_161h0l,FighterWoman,"NTA. I always split, unless I voluntarily offer to pay. I’m a woman. If we want to be treated equal to men, we better start acting like it too."
9,anthkr,t2_imusl,Now_Do_Classical_Gas,"YTA, it's a fucking flag, you don't see Germans sending hateful messages and demanding that Wolfenstein games not be made because they have swastikas in them (they do have them change the swastikas for the German market but that's also stupid). "
9,apcskx,t2_1k6cm1xm,lyra_silver,NTA But you might be over thinking it. You aren't owed any social media posts but I understand your feeling hurt.
9,b1zz1x,t2_3f90j6pd,saltyyyAF_,NTA She shouldn't be turning the job environment into high school drama. And you shouldn't have to quit to escape a hostile work environment.
9,b393hd,t2_27wxtdni,TwentyxOnePilots,"NTA Imma say... this is a weird one. But honestly, when you gotta go, you gotta go. At least you picked it up after."

9,amietk,t2_994jo,thiscouldbemassive,"YTA. Don't promise to do things and not do them. And don't get mad when he wants to actually talk to you about problems you are having. He's your room mate, he needs to be able to actually get ahold of you. "
9,b0kk0a,t2_x1j6s,TentaclesAndCupcakes,NTA - It was double-rude to make you out to be the asshole when they did the wrong thing in the first place.
9,awcw3c,t2_10xtr7,lenachristina,NTA - you have no obligation to be your brother's caretaker. That is something you do because you *want* to and not because you're forced to. This is your parents' mess to sort out - not yours.
9,awcw3c,t2_zmjh74j,Bangbangsmashsmash,NTA. Why does you getting a nursing degree make you more qualified than his parents? That’s stupid 
9,amj73s,t2_11aj7i,cognitivetriad,"NTA. Your mom is a huge gaping asshole. If you haven't already talked to the parents of your niece, try that"
9,amj73s,t2_1xtlje8,honeymustardcustard,NTA but it sounds like your mom got some problems. Missing having young ones around or something. I feel bad for both of you in this situation.
9,amj73s,t2_2e07mipu,desperatehousecat2,NTA. I know it’s not your fault but it’s kind of disturbing that your mom would even be comfortable letting and 8 year old girl sleep in a teenage boys room. You need to have a talk with you mom and put your foot down. 
9,a9eard,t2_zmjh74j,Bangbangsmashsmash,NTA but you should also show your manager her harassment in case she tries to flip the script on you
9,b4mk4p,t2_1gma18ky,echelon_01,"NTA. You DO care about the cats. But your ex is using them as leverage over you to make you feel guilty. Even though you had an amicable breakup, there's no reason you need to maintain a relationship that's become negative."

9,b3xpkj,t2_84dw0,herefromthere,"NTA. You know this is weirdness on his part. Don't give him the reaction, just go out with your brother and or Dad and let your husband sulk if he wants to."
9,b3xpkj,t2_2kzzxkvf,TheQueerRiver,NTA at all. You tried your best to make a compromise and he refused to budge. He's being really stubborn about this. 
9,b73t6k,t2_g7knv1f,jolie178923-15423435,"NTA You have many, many good reasons to not have him stay with you. But do try giving him a come-to-jesus talk. "

9,b73t6k,t2_ucljdb2,pantsupfritz,"NTA. Do not let him stay with you! He's a mess right now, and probably has further to fall. He will turn you and your wife's lives upside down."
9,b8dw7z,t2_22px8kls,jarredvox,"YTA. The entitlement in the post is wild. They're under no obligation to give you a dime. It'd be nice if they did, but they sure as hell don't have to."
9,b8dw7z,t2_4mgxv,SeethingHeathen,YTA. >Now I honestly barely know them at all. So why do you think you're entitled to their money? Just because they're related to you?

9,b8dw7z,t2_1rlo8a43,tobahmeister,"YTA. You make it so obvious YOU only care about their money, and if I were her I would have told you to get lost. You sound like an entitled brat. Their money belongs to them. They don’t owe you shit."
9,b8dw7z,t2_2yx974fw,psychominnie624,"YTA for assuming they have to give you the money. No one is under obligation to loan you anything, even if they’re family, especially when they don’t know you. Take out a personal loan "
9,b8dw7z,t2_ohv69,Dr_thri11,"YTA, you say you barely know them. Why in the world do you think you would be entitled to a sizeable loan from someone you barely know, family or not?"
9,afvqlc,t2_276cprat,Space2Bakersfield,"NTA. Just as much as OP has no right to say who his friend can date or who his ex can date, they have no right to be OPs friend. If it hurts OP emotionally that his friend and ex are dating, he has every right to cut that friend out. OP can be friends with whoever he wants and his friend has no god given right to OPs friendship. "
9,afvqlc,t2_232oekoq,oceansoveralderaan,"NTA friends don't do stuff like that to friends, not if they know you still have feelings for them. "
9,afvqlc,t2_5qpc3u9,thedoctrix,"YTA- your feelings are just butthurt and you're being bitter about it. You weren't enjoying your relationship with the woman anymore, so let him, if they get along! You don't have to lose your gaming buddy if you can get over yourself. "
9,9v55ps,t2_16nd1a,BoneYardBetty,"Not the asshole. You have a responsibility to yourself to take care of your mental health, and quietly removing yourself from a hurtful conversation isn't ""bad"" behavior. I'm so sorry for your loss."

9,aar77b,t2_18a48bu0,kwneumann,"NTA, for not wanting people to touch your stuff. YTA, for lying. You should have out it away somewhere safe and out of sight. You knew this would come up."
9,b678ly,t2_7tib3,sebargh,NTA. You talked to her when it was happening and she didn't care. I doubt she'll care long-term.
9,b678ly,t2_163pkboz,Hellhound265,"NTA She had her chance and she blew it. There's nothing wrong with you not wanting her back, its understandable and your choice."

9,a29xtv,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"NTA. She's the asshole. Expecting you to buy gifts for her 4 kids, especially the teen, especially when you're having money problems is an asshole move. Don't get them anything. So entitled and selfish of her. Remind her you are having money problems. "
9,b8eufp,t2_1hut44ma,poke_thebear,YTA. You are not entitled to your SO's body just because you feel like it. He is just as deserving of respect and time to deal with the things that are causing emotional stress. He doesn't have to give you physical intimacy because you ask for it. 
9,b8eufp,t2_mr5lx,Iconoficons,"Can’t wait to see how this thread turns out..,. Absolutely YTA, your boyfriend is allowed to say wether or not he wants physical intimacy too you know. "
9,a5j2x6,t2_p2x1qs4,InsanityBrickBoi,"NTA. Just because she has some kind of handicap, that doesn't justify being selfish and asinine like that. You should file a noise complaint. "
9,a5j2x6,t2_123rwl,Arvalic,NTA. Just because she's impaired doesn't mean you should suffer. She seems like TA. She could buy headphones if she wanted or at least have the decency to turn it off at night

9,aqkhjf,t2_punl9,forester93,"NTA, it seems like she overreacted pretty hard to an innocuous ""your mom"" type joke. Did you ever tell her the jokes about your height/weight bothered you though? Maybe she didn't actually think she was offending you."

9,ba5yf8,t2_3jbmdt59,FBI_squad,NTA I swear to God the point of yard sales is finding hidden treasures like this.
9,ba5yf8,t2_gqmih,vaxfarineau,"NTA. You bought the items for what the neighbor asked for it, so they’re yours, fair and square. You don’t have to give anybody anything back, because you own them. "

9,ba5yf8,t2_31afgbp6,PetiteSelene,"NTA. This is their fault. That's what happens when you treat people badly. It'll bite you in the butt. As for the uncle, he should have asked for those items long before they were sold. "
9,ba5yf8,t2_3at1toux,LuriemIronim,"NTA. It’s his own fault for not doing his research, and he sounds like a dick. It’s not like he’s a kindly old man selling things to pay for his cancer treatment. "
9,ba5yf8,t2_b4jas,justatog,NTA All sales are final and this is karma biting him on the dierierre.

9,ag4wuj,t2_2n98wvok,Autochthonous7,YTA- Have the decency to tell her why you deleted her when she asks. A year is a long time to talk to someone and just ghost them. 
9,a822ym,t2_4tpk5,sjsyed,NTA. I wouldn’t have eaten it either - I’m a vegetarian and I’m not a bean fan. I don’t think saying that (or something similar) would be disrespectful.
9,b2arjb,t2_esap7,GhostOfStonewallJxn,"NTA. This is your dream vacation, and you’ve already offered to bring your SO along, but she refused. If you have the money and the time, there’s not much she can do to stop you."

9,b13q2u,t2_1jq26pdp,TinnyOctopus,"NTA. An active SO doesn't have the right to control your friendships, and this lady thinks an ex does? Keep doing what you're doing, growing up and moving on is on her, not you. "
9,b13q2u,t2_1zyec91o,dotsisu,"NAH. You're trying to keep your friend around, but to be honest, the best thing to do is to cut contact with your ex and her sister. It's unhealthy to be in close contact with an ex's family member."

9,9z7wvn,t2_2hbekfqn,Farcelynn,NTA. What you put into your mouth is your decision alone. I ain't eatin' no ass-lickin' dog hair.
9,9v8uty,t2_apaa631,Vini-B,"Nope, NTA. Neko is a super lame name and almost always brings to mind a tiny big-boobed over-sexualized loli, unless he is thinking about ""Nekoma"" which is an amazing Volleyball team but still a stupid name for a human."
9,a341w7,t2_2feqc27r,Shallowground01,"NTA I would hate that too, my bed has to be super clean or else I get OCD haha"
9,a341w7,t2_1c8gxeky,chancelaf,NTA I sleep with my dog but not ever if anyone else is sleeping with me. No bed is big enough for two labs and two people haha
9,ba2tgk,t2_2ai956ft,shirleyismydog,YTA They have a crappy job and they are just tryin' to do it. I just walk by them like I'm deaf...if WalMart actually thinks I stole something they can call the police and I'll gladly show them my receipt. 
9,ba2tgk,t2_3bfxf0gf,1_Justbreakup,"YTA, her job is crappy, no need to make it even more crappy"
9,ba2tgk,t2_13mt9u,chickypee,"YTA for confronting her about it. Next time, just say “No thank you” and keep walking. You don’t have to show them your receipt but they don’t want you to know that. At Sam’s Club, you do have to show your receipt because that’s in the terms you agreed to when joining. "
9,a6iiwa,t2_m2eyanu,390TrainsOfficial,YTA. He could've had a genuine safety concern and ignoring him isn't a good idea. Drones can be illegal in some areas.
9,adr3ge,t2_zjtdy,gen_angry,"NTA: Your BF lives there, sister does not. He was sprayed at his own home and she's not apologetic at all about it. She's a racist bitch and needs the cops called on her for assault."
9,adr3ge,t2_2sqborcg,Brit_J,"NTA. I'm horrified she didn't even apologise! I'd be mortified about the text she sent you, let alone the pepper spray. Absolutely NTA. She can bugger off untill she's apologetic."
9,adr3ge,t2_5iiub3,EMS588,NTA but your sister is a class A bitch. If thats how she acts I don't see why you'd ever want a relationship with her anyway. 
9,b7edux,t2_4medk,wmnoe,NTA - and pretty much anyone pressuring you into making a huge life decision just to sate someone else is an AH 
9,ao9oje,t2_36az6dcf,Doctor_R6421,"NTA. If she's dumb enough to actually bring a juul to school in any form, it's her problem"
9,b1b2i3,t2_39e0njc8,mikmakpaddywhack,YTA ...are you really asking if youre the asshole for gloating in their face while they are in the middle of working 
9,b1p9n7,t2_f8ga2,JoeTheVapeBro,NTA. You owe your job / coworkers nothing even if they pretend to care about you they don’t. Do what’s best for you and the people you love. 
9,b1p9n7,t2_53y95e,LucidOutwork,NTA It's a job. You don't owe them your life. They want to schedule you for days you can't work. Find a job where they treat you with more respect.
9,aj8i4a,t2_15u15v2w,Hamb_13,"YTA. She was trying to help you in the manner you asked her, then it didn't go the way you expected and yelled at her for helping you. "
9,aj8i4a,t2_doqtb,MadoogsL,NTA It sounds like you were startled and while you may have reacted a bit strongly when it was clearly an accident her reaction was WAY overboard. Come on no need to cry
9,ad7qrv,t2_w4zv9,DovahFerret,"NTA First of all, what you do doesn't make you trashy at all. So, no, the only asshole in this situation is the cheater. I'd say, if you have concretre proof, show it to your friend. If not, make a polite excuse. Also, you should probably report threats to the police. You deserve to be safe. "
9,acry8l,t2_f5pgc,demon1x,"YTA everyone knows monopoly can be a bit stressful. If you cant be an adult about it dont play. Now if you actually are 12, then no assholes here."
9,acry8l,t2_vbv8pe4,thereal_joshb,Yta don’t quit a game you started playing that’s being a baby she’s just playing smart 
9,b1z3zi,t2_17ru931p,basketballwife,"Ooooof that’s a tough one. It’s never ok to invade someone’s privacy, but I think her reaction is because she got caught doing shady shit. Instead of agonizing over whether you did wrong, I would be happy that you left a toxic relationship. Find someone who doesn’t need external validation. I’m going with NTA "
9,b1z3zi,t2_38obfaye,coffee_cats_books,"NTA... ESH... IDK. It was definitely a breach of privacy to look at her phone, but you had good reason to. And you were right, so...? It's a big grey area, but I think you did what most people would have done. I'm sorry that happened to you. "
9,b1z3zi,t2_esap7,GhostOfStonewallJxn,NTA. She was lying to you and this guy was definitely putting the moves on her. Break it off before she actually cheats on you.
9,9wkkk0,t2_ivz6x,HumpDayBlues,"NTA. She needs to grow the fuck up. It’s a birthDAY, and not even an important one. "
9,agogpt,t2_27r2ssi5,Boredread,"NTA. That’s traumatic and you don’t have to deal with him. It’s great if he changed, doesn’t mean you have to like him or be around him."
9,ams5jm,t2_32dol4yp,JWilk79,"NTA. If you both discussed and prearranged for him to pick you up at a certain time, he is 100% the asshole by ditching you to watch a game. You definitely have the right to be a little pouty lol. "
9,ams5jm,t2_llnzsb5,GrouchyCrouchy,"NTA. You have the right to be livid, never mind a little pouty. Your brother is extremely selfish and disrespectful."
9,b8yzzv,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,NTA. Your wedding IS about you and your fiancée. That's the point. You can have a wedding with immediate family and a few friends if you want. You can have a later reception if you want to separate the events.
9,ays9f4,t2_6myjf,yamoth,"NTA - You do you, if you don't want to sleep at your MIL house then don't. With that said, be an adult about it and confront her instead of pussy foot around it."
9,ba02md,t2_1fnnx4on,38noodles,"NTA. I’m wondering if it’s more to do with your 3rd point, that they intentionally pick employees they know are clean so the company doesnt get in trouble? "
9,b2yb1q,t2_g7knv1f,jolie178923-15423435,"NTA >Edit: is there a way to know when the dog has to pee, I hope someone else can answer this because I have no idea >also I don’t have a leash for him, if he has to be let out to pee how do I keep him from running away? you should probably get a leash"
9,agmhor,t2_kv520,Curiousdragon,"YTA-as I bet it's your city code to have it done. I could care less really, but if someone falls on your part and gets an injury, it's you who are liable. "
9,a5k48f,t2_4ii51u,Bomberman_N64,"NTA. Unless he has an addiction, it doesn't seem unreasonable for him to wait a bit to accommodate you during your pregnancy."
9,aiwwuu,t2_wqyn0,cernegiant,"YTA. This woman made a commitment to her husband. If you two want to have a relationship she needs to end it with her husband first. Also be careful, someone who cheats with you will cheat on you."
9,asxaq6,t2_9pximj0,corgarian,NTA unless I'm an asshole too. My husband likes admiring women with me tho. He likes to hear what I find attractive. 
9,avx20b,t2_go17jff,TheThiccBreadsticc,"Are you an asshole for following the law? Hell no. NTA. You only drive a speed that you feel comfortable going. If they want to be dumbasses, let them go find the cops and get tickets."
9,b64tgf,t2_1n8km6xn,OneSardine,NTA. You're hiring them to do a service for you & paying them. It's well within your rights to fire them. Best to find new cleaners LOL.
9,b64tgf,t2_6cdm6,WesleyPosvar,"I really hope this is a SHP - you're an adult raising a human life and can't even say 'penis' over the internet... YTA - yes it was childish, but you *REALLY* need to be the adult here and make a good example for your kid..."
9,ak87z5,t2_17xdk4gq,cityzombie,NTA - I've had very similar things happen to me there too. I wonder if it was the same mod :/
9,b06rs9,t2_26xls7rt,milee30,YTA and acting like a three year old. Mistakes happen. They apologized and offered to make you food - stop being so whiny. Get over it.
9,b06rs9,t2_29a9o3k,Blinni3,YTA. It is highly toxic to expect people to just know how you feel. Or to expect them to know you are lying when you say everything is fine. They made a mistake and tried to fix it. There are many ways you could have gone about this. And you chose one of the more assholey ways. 
9,a2gry0,t2_xx8jh,Quarterinchribeye,NTA and the 12 year old definitely knows what is happening. If the babysitter were male that person would be locked up. 
9,a2gry0,t2_2ompa54q,MelodyBrooke,NTA: That's fucked! She should not be allowed around kids if she sees no problem with what she's doing.
9,a2gry0,t2_deuyp12,thesugarslug," NTA. That’s so strange to me. Why was she naked? Was she changing? Also, 12 years old is old enough to start thinking more adult thoughts.... overall wtf"
9,aknzun,t2_3396h9yy,SadCatMemesAreLife,"NTA. Why is everybody saying YTA? Look both sides. For one side, he WANTED to sleep with YOU, not her, she likes him, but that's her problem, you're friends, yes, but if you knew it and going to his house because HE INVITED YOU, then no problem AT ALL."
9,aknzun,t2_c8tf1,Kapootpatchaaa,"Ohhhhhhh yeah YTA. It doesn't matter if the guy didnt like her back, she still had feelings for him. You just stabbed your friend square in the back and I really want to know what kind of comeuppance you get."
9,anxzqd,t2_4zyy5,TheBestCheese,"NTA Try to find a compromise. Spend some nights down there, spend some nights elsewhere. If they can't compromise, then they are assholes. EDIT: changed vote from NAH to NTA because OP's parents are assholes. "
9,anxzqd,t2_591w6,Woden888,"NTA - It's totally cool to take space when you need it. Family can definitely be stressful. Spend the time you can manage with them, though; family is important."
9,anxzqd,t2_95174,metallicahomicide,NTA. Get a job or a hobby that gets you out of the house. Avoid them like the plague. 
9,a3xjah,t2_kxwo3,heidiramone,"NTA. You're a kid and you need to be a kid. You're probably too young to really understand her feelings anyways, so I don't understand why she doesn't just talk to a friend instead of you. Also, a parent should NEVER tell their kid that they're *considering* divorcing the other parent. That's way too much to unload on your child."
9,axqvgx,t2_kxwo3,heidiramone,NTA lol. Don't you have one of those microwave cover things at work? They help a bit with the smell.
9,aw7rpq,t2_35r9remt,overboredselfassured,"YTA. You didn't have to pursue the relationship further, but you handled it in the most assholish way possible. Also having a hard time believing this actually happened. "
9,aw7rpq,t2_2wj9a87x,littleheaterlulu,"YTA. Even if you are going to be shallow, you should have found some way to bow out gracefully and spare her feelings. You're also a dick. "
9,aw7rpq,t2_cc998,TheDutchTank,"YTA. You don’t tell someone that you’re not attracted to them because of something they have no control over. It’s really just a dick move. It’s totally okay not to be attracted to her for that reason, but don’t tell her that to her face dude. "
9,aw7rpq,t2_r8ih0pb,ochu_,NTA and now your friend is gaslighting you into feeling bad. If she were any type of good friend she would've let you know beforehand. That's a lie by omission.
9,aw7rpq,t2_2ruydy1y,jradams108,"NTA. That’s an odd situation to be in, no one knows how they’d react in the moment. Surprised how many people think YTA"
9,aw7rpq,t2_ycfq3,unabowler,"NTA. The girl and your so-called friend are assholes for sandbagging you, putting you in an awkward situation, and berating you for your reaction."
9,aw7rpq,t2_2pyloibi,FricktasticFox,YTA. It’s honestly fair for appearance to be a decent chunk of attraction but you couldn’t have handled it worse.
9,aw7rpq,t2_l2qlsye,Quria,"YTA There were so many ways to handle it other than ""I was hoodwinked, see ya."" Yes, either of them could have told you about her condition, but that doesn't mean you needed to be a shitlord to her. "
9,aw7rpq,t2_t0gra,Rivka333,"YTA. **Not** for deciding you weren't interested and didn't want to go out with her anymore, but for the way you did it."
9,aw7rpq,t2_ilnu4,Bobulatonater,YTA for how you handled it. You don't have to date anyone for any reason but it does make you look shallow.
9,aw7rpq,t2_1z9hcpo,r1Zero,YTA. Not for knowing your limits on who you will date but because you couldn't have utilized some tact in letting her down. 
9,aw7rpq,t2_aqeqo,bott04,YTA-I can understand her wanting to be known for her personality and her intent was not to purposefully hurt you. I cannot say the same for how you handled rejecting her. 
9,aw7rpq,t2_21q56cmn,fugz1123,NTA. OP was duped by his friend. Obviously the wheelchair would be a HUGE deal for anybody. OP should be angry at his friend and the blind date for withholding that info. 
9,aw7rpq,t2_1fa79a,bmf09598,"NTA, and it's telling about this sub that a guy gets a YTA response for rejecting a girl with a disability, but a girl gets a NTA response for rejecting a guy with a disability. The posts are actually a few posts away from each other too."
9,aw7rpq,t2_2qzpxthr,golddustwitch,"YTA. Even if that was a problem for you, you could have just been polite and just said you just did not feel like you clicked. "
9,aw7rpq,t2_2ytgt21z,IMNOTDEFENSIVE,"Yta you could have at least turned her down nicely instead of being like ""you're in a wheelchair, bye!"" Wtf? You should get her number and apologize to her. You dont have to date her but for fucks sake."
9,aw7rpq,t2_2uycmijn,OctoSevenTwo,"YTA. It’s fine if you just can’t be with someone in a wheelchair, but just dumping that on her and bolting was what made you the A."
9,aw7rpq,t2_1hsgxx38,ctrandrews,"YTA You sound too childish to be in a meaningful relationship. I mean yeah it sucks you didn't know and you weren't told upfront, but damn! You could have handled it in a much better way. "
9,aw7rpq,t2_1gefcs42,ccsherkhan,YTA. Did you really have to say that? You could of just texted her later and said you didn’t feel a connection. What the hell’s the matter with you?
9,aw7rpq,t2_15ebtned,AspartameDaddy317,"YTA because you handled that like, well, an asshole. You could have cut that off with ok it being a dick about it man. Instead you made that girl feel bad about herself. "
9,aw7rpq,t2_hxhcvkp,Jabronskyi,"YTA. Dude! Your tact on this topic is just unreal and unpleasant. Not being attracted is one thing, but what you said... You're a big douchebag"
9,aw7rpq,t2_2twcotrr,Lil-Bar-of-Soap,"YTA and stop refusing the judgment. ""The truth shall set us free"" my ass you only accept it when it's in your favor. "
9,aw7rpq,t2_32anv,jokemon,"YTA dude lol, you must be young or something but you will find personality goes a looooong way."
9,aw7rpq,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"YTA. From how you handled the situation, how you treated her, and by arguing in the comments. Accept your judgement. You're an asshole."
9,aw7rpq,t2_hmo3sn4,terribletyrunt,YTA. You could have just told her you weren't interested. Instead you had to make it about something she can't change and is probably insecure about anyway. 
9,aw7rpq,t2_b175gdp,maddielovescolours,"YTA, I honestly don’t think this is a valid reason to reject someone right off. It’s not like she was lying about having kids or anything that would seriously effect the relationship. How is this a dealbreaker?"
9,9zndzt,t2_anvz3,Copypasty,"YTA, you’re not fine with how he looks if you hide him from your friends."
9,9zndzt,t2_9q6y5nf,BigEyedFish96,"YTA- did you really have to ask this question? You're an asshole op and you know it. Furthermore your boyfriend deserves better than your ass... If you don't like the way he looks, go find someone as shallow as yourself. Tootles."
9,9zndzt,t2_q1t0oiw,The_Professor52,YTA 100% You need to love him for who he is and be proud of him. If you can’t do this then you need to let him go so that he can find someone that will. 
9,9zndzt,t2_g7qyrmf,Obscurian,"YTA. You have any idea how many women out there would KILL for a guy like him? A guy who puts you in first place? A guy who always keeps you entertained? Fuck me, that dude sounds like a fucking CATCH! But you? Nah, all you have is looks, and those won't last. You're literally dating a guy out of your league. I hope he realizes that and dumps your sorry ass. "
9,9zndzt,t2_7g6ezjl,FIVE_DARRA_NO_HARRA,"YTA. ""I'm okay with his weight, but I hide him from all my friends because of his weight."" Really? &#x200B; Hey I get it. I would not want to date a fat person. But, in that case, *don't start dating a fat person.* He's been who he is since you started dating him."
9,9zndzt,t2_15cld4,GrenadeBlaster,"YTA. If you actually accepted the way that he looked, your friends wouldn't be a concern"
9,9zndzt,t2_11igcq,apathyontheeast,"YTA for the reasons people already mentioned, but also for not being happy in that he IS putting in effort and making (albeit slow) progresss. Just leave the guy already so he can find someone who likes him."
9,9zndzt,t2_dn18b,2_Headed_Cat,"YTA. I had a boyfriend who claimed to love me and think I was beautiful, but it was clear he was ashamed of me because I had bad acne. I made me feel awful."
9,9zndzt,t2_w8o7czv,1990Cali,"YTA, if you’re so embarrassed of this man why are you wasting his time while he can be with a woman who really respects him?🙄 I hope this guy finds a nicer girlfriend cause this one sounds like a flaming b"
9,9zndzt,t2_cdq5e,Aedipus,“My boyfriend is black and I don’t care but I’m ashamed of bringing him around my friends cause they’re racist and might make fun of me. But I don’t care tho.” YTA
9,as3m0x,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,"YTA. You didn't actually ask your boyfriend if he was cool with it, you assumed. Why would he like it? You had the audacity to do it right in front of his face."
9,as3m0x,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,YTA You kissed another dude. Instead of declining out of respect. I would guess you were 14 if not for the mention of alcohol. Maybe you are 16 and underage drinking. But you still know better. How would you feel?
9,as3m0x,t2_2rx0a5au,troubledcardad,Yta You cheated on him. You humiliated him. You don't have the empathy to even understand why he would be upset. Yikes. He needs to leave you. 
9,b4o3lv,t2_avfnlvf,gurilagarden,YTA - I've done this. I also have done this knowing it was an asshole thing to do. It only makes things worse.
9,b4o3lv,t2_9us65kz,SmallKangaroo,YTA - just go next door and say that the music is too loud. You really think metal music is gonna help?
9,b4o3lv,t2_xx4i8,chlocodile,"NTA but seems like you’re “cutting off your nose to spite your face”, as the saying goes. Do you want to listen to death metal at full volume all day? If the answer is no, maybe try contacting her and having an adult conversation about it. Edit: YTA"
9,a1v1ph,t2_y6gk1,TheSpanishKarmada,"NTA, you're doing theater as a hobby. If you ever don't enjoy it then you can not do it. If this would make you uncomfortable, just say no"
9,aorwnz,t2_4tpk5,sjsyed,"YTA. That’s her dad. If she wants him there, she gets to have him there. You’ll get to dictate who is and is not allowed in the delivery room once you’re the one giving birth."
9,aorwnz,t2_1531yxr0,cosmically_drizzy,YTA- she’s giving birth but at the same time ur NTA because a lot of people don’t mind having MILs in the room but FILs just make it awkward because it’s more of a mother daughter and husband moment but it’s her choice 
9,aorwnz,t2_qhki5,SB-1,"YTA. He's still her father whatever you think of him, and any distance between them needs to be her choice and hers alone."
9,aorwnz,t2_16ku1f,p0ptart2333,"NTA. I'm sorry but no matter how big a Daddy's girl I am there's no f'ing way I want my Dad seeing THAT, even though both my sons were born by c-section. And then there's the fact her Dad was a prick in her early life WTF is she thinking?!? STA & He's a rampaging twat waffle. "
9,b32ymu,t2_2kqzj3jn,feedbacksandwich,"YTA. I'm surprised you even have to ask. Revenge is wrong, especially over some teenage break up like yours. You have really dropped this girl in the shit."
9,b32ymu,t2_2k24lsce,PasionatelyRational,"YTA and given you have the maturity of a first-grader, you shouldn’t be having any boyfriends either. What you did was done out of spite. It’s disgusting. However no 22 year old should date underage girls so that guy is an asshole too. "
9,ak0zkc,t2_20jino37,selfawaresquare,YTA. I feel like you're the type of guy who will make your girlfriend think you are breaking up with her before -psych!- it's a proposal! Aren't you so happy and grateful!
9,ak0zkc,t2_2vx39kpu,funkydunk-,"YTA. You shouldn’t treat someone like that, you weren’t giving a compliment, you were creating fear in someone who clearly didn’t deserve it. YTA for the way you’re acting towards the people who’re giving you their opinion WHICH YOU ASKED FOR. So YTA X2."
9,ak0zkc,t2_zfppx,Jacques_Le_Chien,"YTA You basically made the compliment a power stunt. Next time, tip more and show off less. Your date is smart and saw through it."
9,ak0zkc,t2_h5i67,spritanium,Really dude? Of course YTA. You gave this poor waitress a mini heart attack just so you could look like a hotshot a few seconds later. Other human beings are not your pawns.
9,ak0zkc,t2_1n4yr3uz,spacedust94,"YTA. Damn dude I’m cringing. That’s not something you do, especially in that context. If the manager happened to walk past your table or greet you then you could have said ‘hey, that server was awesome!’. The way you did it made it seem fabricated and douchey."
9,ak0zkc,t2_120qxl,loutang10,YTA - third date burgers? Are you 14? You sound like an incel in how you describe your date. You're a beg and a try hard bro. 
9,ak0zkc,t2_13nj3x,Illusionairy,"YTA- you scared the shit out of that poor server on purpose. If she did such an awesome job, what was wrong with saying it to her face, and tipping accordingly? You would have gotten WAY further on all counts if you had just overtipped. "
9,ak0zkc,t2_2elr3rxr,FlippingPossum,YTA. You scared that poor waitress and didn't answer her when she asked about her service. Why the heck didn't you tell HER she provided excellent service then ask to see her manager? 
9,ak0zkc,t2_2belhlsr,Lcmom1231,"YTA! Your date was right, you were totally trying to show off, reading that even made me cringe! How embarrassing. She probably wanted to crawl under the table. "
9,ak0zkc,t2_yk2yg,E3nti7y,"Damn, one of the first overwhelming ""YTAs"" I've seen. I agree tho, even came to make it sound like he wasn't on Reddit to justify it."
9,ak0zkc,t2_s86cf,Librarianatrix,"NTA, but next time, make sure the server knows you want to give positive feedback. Your date sounds lit"
9,ak0zkc,t2_p0e0e1j,Browser2025,YTA for wasting everyone's time trying to show off. Managers really don't have time for this. You're so blind you don't even see the problem.
9,ak0zkc,t2_xnzpe,roqueofspades,"Yikes. If describing your date as ""not obsessed with herself"" wasn't a red flag, then your incredulity at being called out for acting like an ass definitely was. YTA"
9,ak0zkc,t2_2kqby8ow,docmahi,"YTA - Ive told tons of managers that waiters/waitresses did a great job, but never like that. The way you did it was quite pompous "
9,ak0zkc,t2_136w9dr1,the-Bus-dr1ver,"YTA if you want to say a waiter(ress) did well, instead of manipulating them, why not just leave a nice tip"
9,ak0zkc,t2_15ys153x,hahabenis44,"YTA, if you had told the server that you were giving her a compliment before getting the manager it wouldve been NTA"
9,ak0zkc,t2_k34pe7z,SellaraAB,"YTA. What a bizarre and anxiety inducing way to compliment your waitress. It seems like you thought it was a kind gesture, but I'm baffled as to why you would approach it like this."
9,ak0zkc,t2_6lharzu,RealityIncoming,"YTA in soooo many ways, it's a bit scary that you don't see it. I'm also guessing you say M'lady a lot too. "
9,ak0zkc,t2_17c778,smellslikefeetinhere,YTA. This reminds me of the dude who took his date to Pizza Hut and asked to give his compliments to the chef.
9,ak0zkc,t2_a02hi,Kar0nt3,"NTA. You were just akward and obviously could have handled the situation better. Btw what's going on in this comment section... It's like everyone is jumping to wild conclusions to support the preconcibed idea that OP is an asshole, instead of actually judging what happened. Has this sub been /r/all'd already?"
9,ak0zkc,t2_ls76c,jordankid93,YTA. I was gonna say NTA until you got to the part about how to called for the manager. Definitely a dick way of doin that
9,ak0zkc,t2_7j02k,amazonallie,"NTA Run from that chick STAT. She made that about her. A little narcissistic if you ask me, and a huge red flag. "
9,ak0zkc,t2_tqpxk,mitch_michaels17,NTA I don’t get what the big deal is. You complimented a waitress and scored her some points with her manager. I have seen other people do the same. How could you possibly be an asshole for giving a compliment?
9,ak0zkc,t2_17j7r5,youridv1,Your date is probably just as creeped out by you as I am. YTA. Why the hell did you treat the girl like that? 
9,ak0zkc,t2_r7ri5,hashcrypt,"NTA. What the fuck has this society become that complimenting a waitress on her service to the manager now makes them an asshole. Also, TIL saying a woman is a ""Good listener, cute, smart, and funny"" is misogynistic. "
9,ak0zkc,t2_ri96ab2,TiberDasher,YTA. I get what you were trying to do but it was all around over the top. 
9,ak0zkc,t2_10yv5e,hldsnfrgr,"YTA. That only works in the movies or in tv shows. You can't do that in real life , man. That's kind of like doing a bomb joke in a plane or something. I'm exaggerating, but you get my point."
9,ak0zkc,t2_l9aa1,giny33,YTA. You sound like a control freak. Wtf let her know you want to give a good word in for her instead of freaking her out. 
9,ak0zkc,t2_1ys9obta,usernamechecksout133,"YTA, but not a huge one. I do this a lot, but I quietly ask for the manager up front, not ask the waiter in question to get them."
9,ak0zkc,t2_2vlbmgvw,randogirl29,"YTA, your poor date probably thought that you were hitting on the waitress. I'd be rippin if my boyfriend ever gushed over a waitress while we were on a date. "
9,ak0zkc,t2_adka6cs,Aquinan,"NTA for what it's worth, it wasn't the best way of doing it sure but everyone here calling you as asshole is nuts. It's not that big a deal. "
9,ak0zkc,t2_it8cn,chubbin4U,"YTA. At first I wasn’t convinced but then upon reading your further responses...yeah, everyone in the comment section is right. You seem like a jerk. What’s worse is you’re a jerk who genuinely seems to think they’re a “good guy”."
9,9wzmtq,t2_1fqgmkww,ThyssenKrunk,"NTA Dont cut the line. Don't start nothing, won't be nothing, the lady was completely in the wrong"
9,9wzmtq,t2_zehwl,Veritablefilings,YTA for calling the cops afterwards. Knowing you were the one that purposely hit her. She ran off and that should have been the end of it. 
9,ainf1h,t2_3013caup,SillyMidOff49,"NTA The guy is a rapist. A manipulative, calculating sociopath. Don’t waste your empathy or thoughts on such puerile scum. "
9,b5tpf0,t2_qc4da,MappinAround,"YTA.. tho I have done this before myself! I just went to a walk in clinic though to get my sick note, not the damn hospital!"
9,b5tpf0,t2_16iku5,Groxy_,"YTA - Lazy and instead of just coming up with an excuse you wasted the doctors time and money. Get better at lying, damn. Fucking hate people that try and abuse the system like you. "
9,anb5e3,t2_1wwb5x44,cannabisqueenkitty,NTA Unless you’re pushy about it. its her body & she will decide what to wear in the end & you need to accept that.
9,b7qebo,t2_4medk,wmnoe,"Reading the headline I really wanted to just say you're the asshole...but then reading the post...oh hell no. DO NOT take that scholarship. Loans aren't the end of the world, go somewhere you feel comfortable and are accepted. SO NTA "
9,b7qebo,t2_3c7ws1dr,MythicalBeast45,"NTA. Believe me, college can be stressful/difficult enough without being treated poorly over your orientation or gender identity. If you don't think you would be happy there, then don't go."
9,b4ou9g,t2_1wwb5x44,cannabisqueenkitty, ignore him completely. he would have asked you for it years ago if he actually wanted or needed it. this is just an excuse for him to get back in contact with you. 
9,b4ou9g,t2_241zjlo2,Tyty__90,NTA Fuck this guy. He's just up to his same ol' manipulative tricks. Donate the sweater or throw it away and be done with it. Also block him on everything while you're at it. 
9,b4ou9g,t2_yua7p,pearl_pluto,"NTA. This definitely isn't about the sweatshirt, he's using it as an excuse, get a restraining order against this creep."
9,akjma4,t2_16wolz,MouthwashAndBandaids,"NTA I would tell him, because if it were me I would want to know. What he does with that info is out of your control. "
9,ayt4mg,t2_qaaph,TooLateHindsight,YTA Is this so they don't get money? What a goofball you are. I went with yta cause I just think your being ridiculous.
9,ayt4mg,t2_mejbt8f,MajSloth,YTA if the controversy is enough to put you off then don't watch it. If you think you'll enjoy the film and want to watch it the controversy and agenda shouldn't matter. 
9,ayt4mg,t2_86iinu,LearnedButt,"YTA. If you don't want to support a movie, which is totally your call, just pirate it like the rest of us. "
9,adrfbl,t2_dii8k,ElectricFleshlight,"YTA, stabbing it in front of him was unnecessarily traumatizing. I would have sliced it in another room and handed him the deflated ball. Could say the broken window cut it open. "
9,adrfbl,t2_19koclzq,MixMaxMeat,"NTA. You gave several warnings. Accident or not, hurting your daughter and breaking your window was the last straw. That said, this seems pretty fake"
9,adrfbl,t2_bms51,TheGreatUsername,"Yeah, YTA. You should have gone to that kid's parents asking them to reimburse you for the broken window/possible medical bills, because something should be done about this, but taking your anger out on the kid is absolutely NOT the right course of action."
9,adrfbl,t2_2osjz7z6,SharpShel,"YTA. You’re an adult, act like one. Not only did you terrify and break the heart of the neighbor kid, you just taught your own daughter a shitty lesson in how to deal with things. "
9,adrfbl,t2_dcn5p,MiaOh,"NTA You have told them many times, and talked to their parents. I don't think they will be throwing balls at your home anymore. Are they going to pay to replace your window? "
9,adrfbl,t2_11c7hval,clutzycook,"YTA: I might have told the kid that you were keeping the ball until his parents came over and could see the damage the kid had caused. Pulling out a knife and cutting the ball in half is too much, IMO."
9,adrfbl,t2_a5f3n,StormFunsoms,"YTA. But i would've done the same, a little diffrently, but yeah. Accidents does happen, and it would've been diffrently if your daughter was'nt hurt. "
9,adrfbl,t2_2s7o7ia8,hellodarlo69,"NTA- They fucked your shit up and injured your daughter so you cut the little shit's ball, he deserved it."
9,adrfbl,t2_daby3,Krinnybin,YTA. I hope your kiddo is okay!! That’s a scary thing to happen. And I totally get that burst of rage. But yeah.. probably wasn’t the best choice. 
9,adrfbl,t2_12jlkk,Dingusatemybabby,NTA; You are the villian of their childhood and that is awesome. You warned them and then gave them a great story to tell for the rest of their lives. 
9,adrfbl,t2_kqzj9,Kinerae,YTA. Better option would have been to have the parents and / or kids come over and see that they cut someone bloody with their games.
9,adrfbl,t2_l2oelaf,PorQuepin3,YTA. Arent you an adult? You should have told him to come back with his parents too so you could have talked to them about the damages as well
9,adrfbl,t2_2mju90ri,MamaMia95,NTA in any way shape or form. I’m kind of shocked at the responses I’m seeing here
9,asksij,t2_4xaya,aggibridges,"NTA. I'm a woman, and a femeinist. The comic is hilarious, and the guy is being an oversensitive dick. Ignore those people and enjoy what you like :) "
9,b5igmo,t2_34llwgbw,A_True_Nord,"NTA, she knows you dont want to talk in the morning, sounds like she was trying to annoy you on purpose "
9,b2d34y,t2_dsflb,Delicious_Albino,"NTA. As you said, neither of y’all are adults yet. It’s completely understandable for you to not want him to drink. "
9,b89soi,t2_k9r6x,RhoBautRawk,"YTA, or this is a shit post. How was that a prank? You harmed the cat, took away its food and sense of safety, and essentially assaulted your friend by making them have an asthma attack. What the fuck is wrong with you?"
9,b89soi,t2_avfnlvf,gurilagarden,"YTA - Your prank, your responsibility. A prank is only as good as the recipient's reaction. "
9,b89soi,t2_lgncd0m,booksgnome,"YTA. You realize the oils are going to stay, and that room is not going to be safe for the cat OR the human? "
9,b89soi,t2_1ohd7hhc,four20five,YTA and frankly... a horrible person. You should leave her alone before you endanger her or the animal further. Just wow.
9,anieof,t2_1rt29qd9,MatrixMushroom,"NTA. It's 1 for 1, he insulted you, you insulted him. But who really won in the end? The guy who can now post that you, ""overreacted and insulted him"". Always try to handle a situation better than this."
9,anieof,t2_g3jlg87,Ngin3,"Wow I clicked on this thinking you were for sure, but that is just so rude and unnecessary. NTA"
9,anieof,t2_fgv5w,boogieman0330,"YTA. If you don't want your picture out there, don't pose for pictures. Also, you were in a public place so they can take photos as they please. Good luck in life."
9,afrsu0,t2_1c45qi9,WillSellOutForKarma,"YTA, this really doesn't matter to you but you went out of your way to call her out. If she was using it to exploit people for more than just likes on Instagram, I would understand it, but no, you had to keep digging at her, you asshole."
9,ay7o13,t2_396413sb,Memmles8,"NTA you shouldn't have to do that and that policy will lose them customers. Do you know what the survey is about? Also that sales assistant said something shit to you, you're fine to respond like that."
9,acww5m,t2_16z5g7,BananaFrappe,"YTA. Unless she asked for your opinion on her food choice, your comment was preachy, judgmental, and annoying."
9,acww5m,t2_21asixxi,BeefBot9000,Yta and you sound like a douche bag. I doubt this morning was the only factor that lead to her crying. Leave the poor girl alone.
9,acww5m,t2_5w4xb,GuyNoirPI,"YTA Dude, don’t comment on other people’s food when they didn’t ask. Your an asshole for making the comment and an idiot for making it to your girlfriend of all people. "
9,acww5m,t2_2hxmlqpp,arctic-zydrate,"YTA. This shouldn't be a question. She is by no means obligated to follow your diet, and from what you say, it seems like she usually tries to do so. Her eating a sandwich does not affect you...at all... You should really go and give her a hug. "
9,acww5m,t2_2j1g9sp1,pokinthecrazy,# YTA &#x200B; What do you mean you aren't judging her food? You totally fucking are and telling her what she should eat. And she let you know it upsets her so fucking stop it. It's not that hard to treat your girlfriend the way you'd treat any other adult on the planet and let her eat whatever she wants without comment. &#x200B; &#x200B;
9,acww5m,t2_zzktl,cbbclick,"YTA. It's the ""should"" that bothers me. The moment you imply that she should out should not do something, you become the asshole. There are very few times an adult needs to instruct another adult, especially in a relationship. "
9,acww5m,t2_994jo,thiscouldbemassive,"YTA. Listen, she doesn't want to be on your diet and that's okay. You can say what you put into your own body, but you can't dictate what she does with hers. That's overbearing and entitled."
9,acww5m,t2_17k94xff,melsellsbells,Yta it's her choice and I also think the way you said it hurt her not only that you judged her
9,acww5m,t2_fev2mnv,somewhocallmedan,"YTA. Nobody elected you god emperor of someone else's diet. Unless she's about to chow down on broken glass or something you know she's allergic to, keep your opinions to yourself."
9,acww5m,t2_1bdqders,DerHoggenCatten,"You say this, ""She is adult and is able to make her own dietary choices,"" but you don't treat her that way. YTA"
9,acww5m,t2_ccasgn,Wednesday_Atoms,YTA. And as someone who has actually taken nutrition and physiology courses I have to point out that you're also talking out of your ass. 
9,acww5m,t2_5n27oy,zipfsch,"YTA you literally judged her food. It's not a talking point on nutrition, it's just shaming, especially when that isn't even a rule, and you're a huge asshole. "
9,acww5m,t2_zw413,Checkmqte,YTA - You sound like a pretentious and arrogant jerk. It sounds totally condescending and offensive.
9,acww5m,t2_19y5d689,lezlers,"YTA all day. Never, I repeat NEVER offer unsolicited advice about ANYONE’S food, ESPECIALLY the person you’re seeing naked on the regular. It’s just a dick move. If someone wants your advice, they’ll ask. "
9,acww5m,t2_wqyn0,cernegiant,"YTA. If she wants to eat a breakfast sandwich it's not your goddamn place to comment on it in the middle of her meal. This is why people don't like keto/Palo/vegan dieters, because they can't just shit their mouths."
9,acww5m,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"YTA. You claim to not judge her and the way she eats.. yet.. you comment on it anyways. That's judging it. You LITERALLY told her ""she should not be combining a lot of far with carbs"". Let the girl eat her fuckin sandwich in peace."
9,acww5m,t2_1u2mjum0,Idonutevencare,YTA. She probably feels immensely pressured by you and that sandwich sounds just fine. Why should she eat a ridiculously restrictive diet just because you are?
9,acww5m,t2_2mckjjl2,tonymontanass,"YTA i understand that maybe you had good intentions telling her that, but chances are she 100% knows how unhealthy it is or whatever, and maybe she just wanted to indulge. You should not have said anything, as I’m sure you made her very insecure and/or uncomfortable with that comment"
9,acww5m,t2_2ttin8hs,pancakeman49,"nta she overreacted , but if she was on a diet and this was a cheat day then yta "
9,acww5m,t2_2v85r5jh,Yellowbird1980,"YTA, and the way you have latched on to the few comments that sympathise with you tells me you still don’t get it."
9,acww5m,t2_aeu6y,stefaniey,"yta. You made a judgment on her choice of food, don't pretend you ""were just commenting."" She didn't ask you for your opinion, or judgment. "
9,acww5m,t2_2crhdflm,ItalianMothMan,YTA. I have a feeling the reason she started crying is because you’ve been picking on her for a while.
9,acww5m,t2_4roorqg,SicksTea9,YTA Judging on what I've read so far she needs to be with somebody that has an ounce of chill.
9,acww5m,t2_1wlsojk0,DarkDuck85,"Bruh. B r u h. It would be one thing if SHE was cramming paleo down your throat, but here you are with a very judgey comment on her meal and, she has even been trying to eat paleo JUST FOR YOU. Go to hell. YTA"
9,b0ssd4,t2_36jv3pvl,flipityflopityfukoff,NTA doesn't sound like someone to raise a family with. Sounds like the type of dad that tells the kids to share a room because he needs a man cave.
9,b1z6r2,t2_udmac,Hunterofshadows,"YTA If I’m reading this correctly, you’ve basically been this girls father since she was 11. Step up and act like it "
9,b1z6r2,t2_esap7,GhostOfStonewallJxn,YTA. You don’t have any right to tell your fiancée what to do with her daughter. As far as I’m concerned you’re a guest in that home. Get over yourself.
9,b1z6r2,t2_15w1v8,xav264,YTA. It’s really hard to make anything at 19 in today’s world. Maybe you can arrange some sort of rent she can pay you. 
9,b1z6r2,t2_i3dyo,adelavraciu,YTA You can ask them both to move out if you own the house and the relationship is not working out.
9,b1z6r2,t2_9303h,docfarnsworth,"yta, It doesn't sound like she does anything bad. But what really crosses the line is the ""i dont care how she takes it"" and the comment about how you dont care what the mother says because its your house."
9,b1z6r2,t2_ric4q,chartito,NTA You can only be disrespected in your own home for so long. She’s an adult that can face the consequences of her actions.
9,b1z6r2,t2_96483,dendaddy,"NTA , I'm sorry relationships go both ways. If you've truly done nothing to her but be supportive she has to go. "
9,b1z6r2,t2_u9rrbnb,Smallerbuttercup,NTA does she pay bills? Does she help around? Theres no reason for her to live there if she cant get along with you
9,b1z6r2,t2_kfg0b,Joxan13,"NTA, OP you should drop them and move on. You tried and she's a POS to you for no reason. She's using up your resources while giving you the finger. My opinion is unpopular and I dont care about downvotes. "
9,b1z6r2,t2_147uf3,primusinterpares1,"NTA, you can't be expected to house a woman that hates you forever,she's entitled to her feelings, but if she feels that way then it's time for her to leave. Worst case scenario , let her go live with her dad"
9,b1z6r2,t2_2y6mz3sn,runfattiesrun,NTA she’s disrespecting you and it’s your house. You did your best to try to gain her respect and she isn’t respecting you.

9,abzqwn,t2_j741zzz,snartkety,"YTA. But not a major asshole. You should ask or do it outside the house. Vaping still leaves an odor, even if it’s not as bad as smoking. "
9,aoahqr,t2_9eti3,KatFrog,YTA - you can talk to him about his eating habits after you have your own place to eat. 
9,b6v3cj,t2_q808n,Germahy,NTA at all but this reads like a shitpost. She sounds like a shit teacher who takes her real life frustrations out on her students 
9,b49vtm,t2_9q4zy,Korzaz,"NTA. I mean, I don't know what you expected. Your friend is in a shitty situation and the only way it can go from here is physical abuse. Is that what she is looking for before breaking up with him? "
9,a8rjri,t2_iflytbj,Blumpkinz4Babiez,"NTA Doesn't matter what your relationship is. Nobody has a right to out you, period. It's one of the most disrespectful things an individual can do to another. It's up to you to tell them when you're ready. "

9,akocg6,t2_1oosvw5x,DuchessOfGeek,NTA. I try to take my Puerto Rican friend out for Cinco de Mayo every year but she refuses and calls me an asshole. Go figure. Kitty needs to scram. Nothing is more exhausting than a SJW. 
9,atcfa9,t2_37ud0iy2,TempusMotherFugit,"NTA. Just cause she has a shitty life rn doesn’t give her a pass to be a horrible person. If she wants a punching bag she should join a gym, not use you. "
9,atcfa9,t2_9ubsser,throwthestik,"NTA. You owe her nothing, not even friendship, after the way she's been treating you. Let her find out the hard way that she shouldn't be taking her issues out on you."

9,aovzws,t2_17ei81zn,tessah22,"NTA. Your girlfriend is jealous, controlling, and gaslighting you. And she sees no issue with it, so she's not likely to change. "
9,artcne,t2_19bwl3eq,CrescentDarling,NTA if his bed broke because you simply sat on it then it was either bad quality or poorly put together. Neither of those are your fault.

9,b42h4x,t2_26hzbxtx,Prepure_Kaede,"Hard to judge. You could do this temporarily to get the point across in which case NTA, but if you cut them off forever over this I'd say it's an overreaction"
9,b42h4x,t2_2it1nomo,hastur777,"YTA. Their exhortations may be annoying, but cutting someone out of your life is what you do for abuse, not annoyance. I don’t see anywhere where you’ve tried to tell them not to bring this up. "
9,b42h4x,t2_kssq4,BSnIA,"YTA. Complete overreaction. I get it is annoying, and kinda prying, but no contact seems extreme for people who raised you since you were 4. "
9,b64p65,t2_iit2wre,aKamikazePilot,NTA. The bigger question though is are you going to take the dog to the vet to get her eye checked out?
9,ab9cnr,t2_1x2st2w,mutherofdoggos,NTA. I don’t even know why she’d want to bring her new man to her old man’s friend’s party.

9,ab9cnr,t2_16981o48,-comfypants,"NTA, but I doubt you'll be able to change her mind on the matter. Considering it's your friend group, she shouldn't attend at all if she's not going with you. "
9,azxs23,t2_jp9eeol,mab6644,YTA I understand you had good intentions but she was already traumatized. You should have respected her wishes. It wasn't your place to go to the police.
9,azxs23,t2_72vcua,05632054,"YTA. I get that you had good intentions, but in this case, going to the police was kind of selfish because you did it to appease your own mind and not hers. You didn’t listen to what she’d said, and by taking that choice away from her, you weren’t being supportive. "
9,b8x2bz,t2_7tfy2c,CoastalCerulean,"NTA not at all! Your parents have their priorities all jacked up, and I’m sorry. You deserve to be treated better. Are you working still? Do you have access to food between now and the 15th? "

9,audeqz,t2_2sgya0aj,sadyarnbitch,YTA. It’s cruel and is basically amputating their fingers. If they ever managed to get out they would have no way of defending themselves either. Just no. 
9,audeqz,t2_1kfdjj5y,avocado__dip,YTA. Declawing is like breaking off the tips of their fingers. A lot of vets don't do the procedure anymore. Do some research before you make medical decisions.
9,audeqz,t2_2215yimg,Spicymayogoddess,"YTA if you do it. It's extremely irresponsible and painful. Don't do it and read up on the practice instead, consult a vet. "
9,audeqz,t2_2n79ojvl,rescuesquad704,"YTA. This isn’t just trimming nails. It amputates every single toe at the knuckle. How would you feel about that happening to you? Also, be aware in many countries it’s illegal. "
9,audeqz,t2_2zxj46f7,catsforthewin1234,YTA You don't ever deserve cats if you even consider this.!!! Want me to rip out your nails so my furniture is okay and I don't have to train your properly?
9,at0asf,t2_2y4b5qfz,Drchilli,"YTA if you don’t go, but NTA for not being enthusiastic about going. You’re not going to have a good time, you’re going because you love your wife and want her to be happy. "
9,b0vvsa,t2_pctbv,KarmaG12,NTA. You're the go between for a reason. You did your job whether she likes the results or not.
9,axux7u,t2_18hy9gib,fishmom5,ESH verging on YTA. The assumptions and ableism are bad. The screaming and swearing is definitely worse. You owe your wife and her parents an apology.

9,azkzlo,t2_1kfdjj5y,avocado__dip,NTA. It's not like you made them eat it right then and there. They really need to let it go. In most cultures it's the polite thing to overfeed your guests.
9,azkzlo,t2_2b8hzzjp,OrangeDoormat,NTA. You were being a good host and doing something nice. They should have just graciously accepted it even if they didn't want it and never brought it up again.
9,azkzlo,t2_1e2krssr,bigrottentuna,"NTA. It sounds like you didn't really listen to what they said they wanted, but they are making a big deal out of nothing."
9,ab2pkg,t2_2eainbpb,P3p3Silvi4,NTA. Fuck them. They cant dictate to you that you cant use their things and then expect to use the stuff you bought for yourself because it suits them all of a sudden. 
9,aeg8xj,t2_ci2zd,doradiamond,"NTA. But seriously, you should cut contact with this guy. The fact that he's being this possessive is worrying."
9,aeg8xj,t2_cvokn,in_da_heat,"NTA Seems like you two need to define your relationship and seems like you just want it to be friends. So make it clear to him, just telling him to stop saying that he loves you will not solve the problem. "
9,b2gpgu,t2_2oijha1b,BigQuestions5,"NTA- You don’t owe anyone friendship, or need a reason to cut people off. They seemed rude, and you’re probably better off. "
9,b2gpgu,t2_q0eac,ProllyCoolerThanYa,NTA. I've had some toxic friendships before and I know exactly what it feels like to be shit on when you felt happy about something. This seems like one of those cases.
9,a2flwr,t2_n360f,Torterrain,NTA - smoking is your habit and listening music is theirs. Both can complain about it to the other but you smoke outside and they listen music inside so I would say they are the asshole
9,a2flwr,t2_bz0l1,MrMikeJJ,"NTA. They are though for loud music while people are trying to sleep. Spray some deodorant on your clothes after a cig, if it bothers them that much. "
9,b64ge9,t2_2htplv4u,DrgSlinger475,"NTA. It's your group, not hers. It's also not a ""nude"" in the traditional sense. A guy without a shirt on hardly counts as a ""nude"". Sounds like your friend is a prude. Or jealous."
9,b3imjh,t2_k9r6x,RhoBautRawk,YTA damn dude if you two were really friends you'd do him the favor of giving him a day to cash in on the deal

9,adw4pn,t2_f23gl,Iisham,YTA for still trying to force it when 3/4 are fine with current situation. If it's such a big deal you should remove yourself.

9,b10y9w,t2_1eqjzkk9,JamesTheCrab,"NTA But you should’ve told your bro first, maybe offered for him to buy them back from you just in case he really liked some that you didn’t want as much?"
9,b10y9w,t2_dripi,jmerridew124,"INFO - Did you pay for them? Edit: NTA. They're yours. He can get his own. If you want to be an awesome brother gift him a system and let him build his own collection, but you aren't an asshole if you don't."

9,b09tax,t2_xv636,ex-inteller,YTA so much I can't even express how mad reading this made me. You're literally the worst. Do you also microwave fish? I mean have some common decency.
9,b4ihws,t2_3fpw39qa,Throwawayaccountuss,NTA seems like he has issues. Or is it like he's been working his ass off for a year only to buy the new oven he wanted?
9,b4ihws,t2_12znge8p,xXHyrule87Xx,"Does his oven not have a cleaning mode? This happens with us too, but the cleaning mode turns that cheese to ashes. NTA"
9,b9eyho,t2_rpbet,j0m1n1n,"NTA. Ultimately, it's her decision. But after two years, you've earned the right to express how you feel about it. "
9,b9eyho,t2_4tpk5,sjsyed,"I really hope it's a typo and you meant to write ""my girlfriend"". Because saying ""my girl"" is creepy. Aside from that, NTA. Plastic surgery can be dangerous, and it's important she hears that from someone."
9,a3vjz3,t2_wv22ewe,Dazza93,"YTA. Adopting a child is not like buying a toy in a shop. You can't just send them back when they're broken. You are a parent, learn to parent. Its tough but its what you signed up for, this kid didn't choose you, you chose him. Imagine the damage you would be doing to him if you did ""return"" (read abandon) him. &#x200B;"
9,a3vjz3,t2_npnp46m,VerbalThermodynamics,"YTA, if you start to try and give him back. If not, then you aren’t. You adopted a child. That child is your responsibility.

9,a3vjz3,t2_cdibl,cutekittensmeow,YTA - If you had a biological child and they were struggling with mental illness as a 6 year old would you abandon them?

9,allagl,t2_2gsvs9c5,Kinghyrule90,"You're certainly NTA here, I'd say. If anything your GF is the asshole because she should know how easy you are to work up and still chose to belittle your preference in a vehicle."
9,allagl,t2_7lkvc1g,a-little-sleepy,NTA I think you are in an emotionally abusive relationship and she is gaslighting you - as well as straight out insulting you and your opinions. Don't be around someone like that. 
9,aqprov,t2_2myy2yvo,a_paulling,YTA a bit. I understand your caution but you did overreact quite a lot. You probably should have talked to her first.
9,ba8jpv,t2_1t7binh5,00Lisa00,YTA - passive aggressive is never the answer - I repeat - passive aggressive is never the answer. Use your words and say you don't choose to do this. You say you're 16 not a baby but this is truly babyish behavior.
9,ba8jpv,t2_8svb3wc,666-take-the-piss,"NTA for intentionally making your stepdad uncomfortable because he's making you uncomfortable, but... stop. This isn't cool, there are better ways to go about it."
9,ba8jpv,t2_11qbqg,godrestsinreason,"YTA - don't be petty. All you're going to end up achieving is bringing a needlessly sexual element to your relationship with your step dad and making your mother uncomfortable. If you don't want to call him dad, then don't. "
9,ba8jpv,t2_s1ay7,sanctusali,NTA. Anyone saying otherwise definitely doesn’t have remarried parents who make things weird. The dynamics between a child and step parent are always uncomfortable. Your mom’s husband is just making it worse.
9,ba8jpv,t2_1lvya3g0,crinklebosslava,YTA You think it’s cool to sexualize the situation to make him uncomfortable? How about growing some balls and tell him no you’re not calling him dad
9,ashi8g,t2_pcitxcd,Wikidess,"YTA - you admit to being an attention seeker because you weren't getting enough attention from your friends, and then you got mad at them for calling you out on it. "

9,a52hhj,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,"NTA for leaving, but you are the asshole for not holding his feet (pun intended) to the fire and MAKING him clean up HIS own fucking mess. You kept trying to keep the peace by saying that you would do it. That makes you an enabler. "

9,ah0a9o,t2_80tnd,grocho,"YTA. They're adults, having lube in their bedroom is normal. And so is having sexy underwear. Give her a chance, having a step child isn't easy. "
9,ah0a9o,t2_2wzp8r3n,evilrobotlizard,"YTA, why are you rifling through their laundry to find her undergarments? That’s very invasive. They aren’t “shoving” it in your face, you’re invading their privacy and seeking out reasons to be offended. "
9,ah0a9o,t2_2dhte57e,InformalPresent9,"YTA. You sound like a fucking creep, spying in their bedroom and being concerned about her underwear. You probably belong in an asylum, not a shared flat."
9,b52pbc,t2_5bto4y,jbh01,"YTA. > I say in a slight yelling voice ""just leave motherfuckers""​ > Am I the asshole for yelling at them my girlfriend sure thinks so. It wasn't necessary, the librarian was dealing with it, you were just being nasty."

9,b9qtbv,t2_zab64,craig_prime,NTA. You **tried** to help him. Years ago. He treated you like shit for it. Why would you help him now? And that's not even including his lack of help during your divorce.
9,b9qtbv,t2_3edpg6o,veastt,"YTA I get what you are feeling, but he's your only family and it could honestly have been the wife that was manipulating him to behave the way he was behaving, love makes a fool out of us all. Give him a chance "

9,b9qtbv,t2_88g5c,OPtig,NTA if you simply don't want a close relationship with your brother. If you're cold to him out of spite or for revenge then you're in TA territory.
9,b9qtbv,t2_2hpu6qea,krill482,NTA You should tell him how he basically kicked you to the curb when you asked for his help during your divorce. Then ask him why he did it. Then decide whether to help or not based on his response.
9,b9qtbv,t2_1e2krssr,bigrottentuna,"NTA. Really, no matter what you decide to do at this point you would not be the asshole. That said, would you rather respond with tit for tat or try to repair the relationship? "
9,b9qtbv,t2_3ayn3ry6,DirectGoose,NTA - BUT it sounds like his wife is the one who destroyed your relationship with him. If he's divorcing her it's probably worth salvaging the relationship and supporting him.
9,b9qtbv,t2_1yuu7lrt,The-Wise-Old-Sage,"NTA - I don’t think you’d be an asshole for not helping him, but it would be nice if you did "
9,b9qtbv,t2_1x63qrb2,liluyvene,"NTA. Your choice here should be the answer to this question: Do you want to foster a relationship with your brother again? If you do, forgive him and support him the way you wanted him to support you. If you don’t, then you aren’t an asshole for refusing. You just need to decide if you want to try and have a relationship with him or not. "
9,b9qtbv,t2_37eqcf72,AwwHellToTheNo,NTA you don’t have to be nice to asshiles and it doesn’t make you one to do nothing. 
9,b9qtbv,t2_yq4nm,Genestah,NTA. But be the better man and help your brother. You have nothing to gain by holding a grudge against your brother. You'll never know when you'll need him the next time. 
9,b9qtbv,t2_27g22qr6,bowlofnotes,NTA- but it's your chance to do what's right. You don't have to give him shelter. But Take him to dinner let him vent. Lend him some cash if he really needs it. Love makes us do stupid things. Don't let this ruin your relationship with your brother.
9,b9qtbv,t2_3emwevaf,c-est-magnifique,NTA But if it's in your power to help him without going too far out of your way you might want to consider it. 
9,an8pb2,t2_13v81yzn,CariadChavez,YTA - Bring your own cheapie yellow towel and use that for wiping down the machines. Don't make people sit in your soup.

9,azcxjk,t2_mi8cbqp,crystalinguini,"YTA? Let me get this straight. You're upset that your manager asked you and your coworkers to talk less, and you were so darn insulted that you walked out?? And now you're out of a job. What did you expect to happen after walking off after a reasonable dictation?"
9,a1rpn7,t2_161h0l,FighterWoman,"NTA, but consider if it’s worth picking the fight. If you’ll get the promotion in say 6 months if you behave... you might be better off hiding your frustration."
9,aru0cj,t2_ebqfpe,Watsonmolly,NTA - do whatever you need to protect yourself. You don’t owe either of them anything and nothing about the way your dad behaves is normal or acceptable .
9,atzi2f,t2_2sw4bedd,actualdisasterbi,"NTA Even if your sister is being a spoiled brat, it isn't your place to intervene. You can vent to your parents all you want, but at the end of the day, if they're okay with it, it's their business how they allow her to treat them."

9,9wi9zo,t2_2g6sbd2e,madzizou,"NTA, of course. You don’t need to have boyfriends/girlfriends if you don’t want them. Who you date is your decision, and being choosy with your partners is better than settling for anyone who asks you. Plus, you’re only 19. You have years yet to start thinking about that sort of thing. "
9,9wi9zo,t2_bdv0s,hobochomsky,"NTA, as long as you're doing it in a polite way. That's your preference to stay single, you shouldn't have to be forced into anything if you don't want to."

9,arm0yc,t2_k50gj,donutshopsss,NTA. This guy sounds like a douchebag when drunk and can't control himself. I don't blame you for not wanting to spend time with him while intoxicated. 
9,a43d81,t2_bt5u0,ogurzhov,NTA. Rehoming the dog is better than him going to the pound. It is not your responsibility to take care of him. Good on you for looking out for the pup. Find a family that will love him!

9,aet5d9,t2_43y29,RevRaven,"YTA - You can get locks for your room as well. He rents the room, he can do whatever he likes in there. He can let his guest stay in there if he likes. You guys don't live together. You live in your own rooms with communal rooms attached. He has no burden to talk to you in any way at all."
9,aczngx,t2_qrfkb,cautionjaniebites,"NTA What he's doing to you is wrong. Remarriage doesn't mean forgetting about 'the old family'. Your feelings are valid, so never let him tell you that you're in the wrong."

9,aczngx,t2_ehvq7,power602,"NTA. My advice would be to tell him how much it hurts you. He is trying to act like it's not a big deal, so make sure he knows that it is a big deal. Don't feel sorry for him if he feels guilty, because he very much should. Honestly, if I were you, I'd feel like he chose her over you, which would be an awful feeling. Good luck."

9,b3l3ah,t2_js8yh,Chinoiserie91,"NTA, why would you not be able to leave a therapist for any reason you feel like? "
9,a3q0eh,t2_keqi2,book-reading-hippie,"NTA This person literally tried to make out with your GF while you were in the other room, you have every right to feel uncomfortable about them hanging out"
9,b9hri8,t2_ucl94,ChemPossible,"NTA. “If you really feel that I’m somehow doing a disservice to your kids by not loving them as much as my daughter, then maybe you should break up with me”. "
9,b9hri8,t2_1kfdjj5y,avocado__dip,NTA. Of course you'll feel more deeply for your own flesh and blood over someone you've known for 2 years. But you should probably walk away when she tries to bait you.
9,b9hri8,t2_uyxiovh,ColebyArnett,"NTA, you didn’t do or say anything wrong. She sounds like a handful. I’m sure there is more good times than bad, but thats a ridiculous situation to put you in. "
9,aephhd,t2_cjjpm,mulligun,"NTA for being upset. Fucking lmao though, your brother might be the most likable asshole I've seen on this sub. Left alone for all of two minutes and he's cucking his big brother. Classic."
9,b2k3jm,t2_1kdlxn8v,wildferalfun,YTA. Licking a child is fucking weird and gross. Being so ridiculous that you can't figure out how to communicate without licking someone. 
9,ab4hn4,t2_1p545jo9,starwarstina,"Nta. Your mil can watch them if she would like. You made plans already and took care of them like a responsible adult. Way to go, buddy. "
9,ab4hn4,t2_2osjz7z6,SharpShel,"NTA. And seriously wtf is wrong with your SIL? She really had her mommy call and ask y’all to babysit? She sounds like she has a lot of growing up to do. And honestly, your MIL is running the risk of putting herself in a bad situation if she keeps inserting herself into situations like this. She needs to tell her daughter (the SIL, not your wife) to clean up her own messes. Enjoy your kid free holiday!"
9,ab4hn4,t2_1l7pljw,nikosteamer,"NTA by any stretch of the imagination , you don't ask people a day before to babysit and then throw a tantrum because they won't drop their plans. Why doesnt the mother in law do it ? "
9,aplqzd,t2_5avl6ad,ARKPLAYERCAT,"NTA doesn't matter the situation you're in your home. You dont have to open the door for anyobdy, family or not. "

9,ar35jn,t2_118bl9,annualgoat,"NTA. She CHOSE to disregard and disrespect your identity for a religion she found, AFTER she had shown you nothing but respect and love when you came out. It's a slap to the face, honestly. She hurt you and will continue too until she apologizes or changes her mind. "
9,ar35jn,t2_1i5a6jfm,iforgotmyanus,"NTA she sucks. If a crooked and bigoted interpretation of religion allowed her to dead name and misgender you, then religion can hold her hand through this tough time. She made her bed. "
9,aije30,t2_ridn7,Stinkehund1,NTA. They clearly didn't do the job you paid them for and they're not entitled to more money just because they're lazy and/or incompetent.
9,aije30,t2_yzg839y,AliceChaine,"NTA. Cats can’t clean up after themselves, especially without a clean litter. It was part of the job, and she knowingly didn’t do it. You owe her nothing. She didn’t do her job. Instead, she should be paying you back for damages. "
9,aije30,t2_2f05g2f7,NerdInA_Bottle,"NTA!!! The poor kitten! :( It was her task, if she didn't feel up for it, she shouldn't have taken the job!"
9,aije30,t2_2x23xaox,DecayingFruit,"NTA , holy fuck that child deserves no payment at all, rather she deserves an assbeating"
9,az7l9u,t2_16iku5,Groxy_,NTA - it's not an asshole move but it's always nice to be considered. They're overreacting but it doesn't hurt anyone to invite them next time. 
9,atz87p,t2_ohv69,Dr_thri11,"NTA, just tell your friend you're really into botw right now and taking a break from the other games."
9,atz87p,t2_2sw4bedd,actualdisasterbi,YTA - but not for not wanting to play with the guy. You're the asshole for beating around the bush rather than just being honest. 
9,b5tgo2,t2_7wy7x,skinsfan55,Only $5? That's a decent amount of money. I say NTA. You didn't do anything wrong and if you caused trouble for the cashier it's only because they were being the asshole. 
9,b5tgo2,t2_78028,Meloetta,"NTA, it was his job to handle it and he didn't, so he got in trouble. That's how it goes."
9,b5tgo2,t2_mkgv55h,sapphicpenguin,"NTA. You tried to rectify the situation in the restaurant and the cashier was not cooperating, so you let a negative review. This is the cashier's fault for not trying to rectify the situation."
9,b5tgo2,t2_pctbv,KarmaG12,NTA. The cashier didn't want to do his job properly when you addressed it with him so that's his fault.
9,b5tgo2,t2_9303h,docfarnsworth,Nta that’s a really strange encounter considering you hadn’t even left the counter
9,b5tgo2,t2_1qabgzef,ComprehensiveWriter6,"NTA - you're the customer, you're buying food and service. You got bad service and then bad follow up until the manager tried to fix it."

9,b43kef,t2_h22v6,NachoDawg,NTA - your parents are enabling her behavior by asking you to forgive her without her asking to be forgiven
9,b43kef,t2_e9ina,RisingxRenegade,NTA. You have to prioritize your mental health if she treats you like that. Also your family needs to hold her accountable for her behavior before they they even try to push you for reconciliation.
9,acx62a,t2_zmjh74j,Bangbangsmashsmash,"YTA for yelling only, she deserves to be grounded/have punishment. Aren’t you in some ways proud of her communication, and how you’ve raised her?!?"
9,arun8w,t2_16ihjhtq,bigfatgato,I’m in between NAH and YTA. YTA a bit because you extremely extremely **extremely** overreacting. You bought him the massage. You have no place to be upset about it. 
9,arun8w,t2_iths4,Bunny36,NTA. It seems like you are not in a polyamorous relationship right now and I really don't understand why your husband wouldn't think to double check. In that situation I would also feel cheated on.
9,arun8w,t2_g07hk,AndrewWaldron,YTA. You should have paid more attention to the gift you were giving. You getting mad at and quilting him is f'd up. You created this whole mess and now want to hold it against him.
9,azybh8,t2_14an6n,therealmccoyster,NTA and you should try to whatever you can to document the cult weirdness and help your siblings get out. There are groups that can help I'll let you do your own research. 
9,ai4pe2,t2_otf88,mecpaw,>if I was a normal boyfriend or a real man I would be okay with the call NTA. It seems you 2 have different views on what constitutes a real man. 
9,arooyg,t2_200ne7k5,PissMcTard,YTA. It's kinda like grounding your children during the week in this day and age. 
9,arooyg,t2_rfkmj,976692e3005e1a7cfc41,"YTA. My parents did this with my Atari until I was 12, and that was pushing it. Your youngest is 13."
9,arooyg,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"YTA and incredibly over controlling, holy shit. If their grades are good and they get their shit done, what's the point of you taking their phones? To be controlling. Not cool."
9,arooyg,t2_2401o7c1,skullz650,YTA. I had electronics in school. Hell I had the most lenient parents ever and I’m doing just fine in life. 
9,arooyg,t2_iojlt,GimmeMuchosMangos,YTA. my mom used to do this to us growing up and it was just controlling and weird. As an adult I really don’t have a relationship with her. 
9,arooyg,t2_1102k2,PM_ME_UR_NETFLIX_REC,YTA How are they going to learn healthy behaviors as adults if they don't get to practice them as children?
9,arooyg,t2_192st0iz,Slapped_with_crumpet,YTA- Constantly punishing them for nothing justs makes them resent you. Use it as a punishment to keep them well behaved and getting good grades.
9,arooyg,t2_pvu6j2v,mydude0940,"YTA you sound like you dont really know how to be a parent, atleast not a good one"
9,arooyg,t2_dih06,limpack,"NTA! There are real dangers for juveniles through the internet and they are doing well because YOU raised them well! But NEVER ask Reddit when it comes to disciplining your kids, Reddit is a libertarian shithole when it comes to raising kids!"
9,alyq0f,t2_k9r6x,RhoBautRawk,"NTA, you should seriously dump him. He's lying to you and you'd be able to find someone who's better for you that isn't three hours away."
9,b14bpm,t2_mfxe3,_STY,"This boils down to ""I feel someone mistreated me so I said something mean."" Are YTA for saying something mean? Probably, really mildly. Are you justified? Probably. Is this worth another ounce of your time or effort? Probably not. Just stop talking to her."
9,b14bpm,t2_3dwgyrtf,ouchmyneck1994,"YTA - the only people who deserve abusive relationships are people who are abusive themselves. Sorry, but you were some random guy on Tinder. Not even a close friend. She owes you no explanation. Yes, it was rude of her to ghost you, but that doesn't mean she deserved to get slapped around by her boyfriend."
9,b14bpm,t2_2mbc2jbq,Neurotica_XOXO,"YTA and petty. You basically said ""you deserved real pain and possibly abuse because you bailed on some random dude you barely know"" which is ridiculous "
9,b14bpm,t2_7za20,Prince-Lee,YTA. It was two years ago. You never even met in person. Why are you still holding onto being ghosted two years ago? 
9,9ym2n3,t2_q5mq1jq,duckkgoquackk,"NTA, he challenged you to take the money and you did so, if anything he owes you a tenner"
9,a4eg7e,t2_118c1a,neuroctopus,"YTA, not for being mad, but for yelling at someone. You had every right to say you were angry in a calm voice, which is what classy people do. But having said that, I'm sorry you hate your hair! That sucks!"
9,avx7zw,t2_xu9ys,TigerKirby215,"ESH, leaning on NTA - Kid was stupid but he's just a kid and you should've probably been more careful. Kid was ultimately responsible for running into you but you should've been more careful."
9,b7ko06,t2_3b7l9acc,bored_german,NTA. Emotional abuse is horrible and you have every right to ghost her for it. I wish I had your backbone to go NC with my father.
9,b7ko06,t2_y6baj,PBRidesAgain,"NTA- You for yourself out of a bad siduation, and you're not The only one. /R/justnomil also includes posts about moms. It's okay to cut toxic people from your life, even if they are family."

9,b7ko06,t2_1ds0jy6,sjsto,"NTA. Letting toxic people go is a good thing. I know a lot of people think ghosting is wrong, but honestly it gives you a clean break. Narcissists won't heed your explanation anyway, so don't waste your time or your air giving one."
9,awwmsy,t2_99wmj,TenthSpeedWriter,"YTA. It's ultimately her decision; what you want for her doesn't matter here. There's a chance she'll regret it but it's her choice to regret, not yours."
9,awwmsy,t2_1kfdjj5y,avocado__dip,"YTA. If she did not ask for your opinion, don't give it to her. It doesn't matter what you want for her, she is not a child."
9,a7junv,t2_ucszje6,TNS72,"NTA, maybe NAH. of course you should strive for high grades, but it shouldnt ruin your day. As another user pointed out, your dad really does seem to care about you."

9,a6jc38,t2_16gtsl,cbh28,"NTA. The friend should have stood up and let the pregnant woman sit down. These two women are the assholes in this situation, harassing you and even touching you without your permission. "
9,a6jc38,t2_2qvoustv,SiriusLeeBlackk,NTA she had a seat and she gave it up. That’s her choice. She doesn’t get a free pass at any seat she wants on the bus.
