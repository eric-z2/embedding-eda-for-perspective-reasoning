Just for fun, I decided to do a 5-minute simulation of your question to illustrate the result. &#x200B; Sim #1: A large company (50 employees), testing 2 employees a month for 24 months with truly random sampling. Employee: **1 2 7 12 14 17 18 19 20 21 24 31 33 35 36 37 38 39 43 47** 3 10 13 15 22 23 Times tested:**0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0** 1 1 1 1 1 1 Employee: 25 28 29 34 40 41 44 45 46 48 49 50 4 6 8 9 27 30 42 11 16 26 32 **5** Times tested: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 **4** &#x200B; Excuse the messy formatting, but you can see that many employees (1,2,7,12,14,..., 43, 47) never get tested at all, while employee 5 got tested 4 times. &#x200B; Sim #2: Same parameters. Emp:4 5 6 9 11 14 17 20 21 30 32 33 34 35 37 39 40 48 50 1 2 8 12 13 15 16 Tests: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Emp: 18 19 24 25 28 29 31 36 42 43 44 45 46 49 7 23 27 38 47 3 26 41 10 22 Tests: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 &#x200B; Again, many employees never get tested, but a couple (10,22) get tested a lot. &#x200B; Sim #3: A small company (10 employees), testing 2 a month for 24 months. Emp: 4 1 3 5 9 10 7 2 **6 8** Tests:1 3 4 4 4 4 5 7 **8 8** Employees 6 and 8 might feel picked on, but it's just the random number generator getting them! &#x200B; Sim #4: 10 employees, testing half of them every month for 24 months. Emp: 7 5 6 2 10 4 8 1 3 9 Tests:6 9 10 11 12 13 13 15 15 16 Again, employees 1,3, and 9 are outliers. &#x200B; Sim #5: 10 employees, testing 80% of them each month for 24 months. Emp: 4 3 6 7 5 1 2 8 10 9 Test: 16 18 18 18 19 20 20 20 20 23 Here, you get something much closer to a uniform distribution, but there are still outliers. &#x200B; The point is that in any random process there are bound to be outliers, and trying to determine whether you are one of the outliers that is bound to occur or if there is some systematic bias in the testing process is not a trivial matter that can be done by the eyeball test. If the testing process is truly random, there will be convergence to a uniform distribution where everyone gets tested with the same relative frequency, but you will almost certainly never witness this ideal probability distribution in a small sample of tests. &#x200B;"
