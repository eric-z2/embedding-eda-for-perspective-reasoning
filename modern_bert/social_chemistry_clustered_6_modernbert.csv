6,b1r8b0,t2_3d3pjchl,drbiddy,"YTA, I don’t blame you for mouthing off to guy, but ywta for taking Jane down too"
6,b5lqzc,t2_3b1uayqy,GlorySBitch,"NTA. If she were polite, no problem. Old lonely women can be assholes too, and 60 ain’t that old!"
6,b5lqzc,t2_25m5e68c,bullili,NTA She isn't paying for it and parking there blocks you from leaving. Contact your landlord again
6,axv8rk,t2_9303h,docfarnsworth,"Nta, I can see the made up name being weird since it’s your step father. "
6,a1rg3q,t2_hj1rj,BlazeReborn,"NTA. I'd try to find out where these two little assholes live, and tell their parents about it. "
6,a1rg3q,t2_3nm3w7j,shortsonapanda,"NTA but seriously, stop doing obviously fine things and then coming to AITA for validation."
6,a1rg3q,t2_dr3m3,Pec0sb1ll,"NTA, I’d have broken both the guns. Then made them take me to their parents. "
6,a1rg3q,t2_1g6ccpmp,pursuitofthewanted,"NTA. Wish you had ""shot"" them in the leg first, little sociopaths. (Only a little kidding, I'm a BIG animal lover.)"
6,a1rg3q,t2_2dfmnuv2,LiquidHwite,"NTA, fuck those little shits, and thank you for sticking up for that old mans dog"
6,a1rg3q,t2_2ofdonef,Fizzzure_,NTA those kids shouldn’t have been shooting at that poor defenseless dog.
6,a1rg3q,t2_anip70y,ExcitedWaffle,You're pretty clearly NTA but thanks for your service against stupid kids!
6,a1rg3q,t2_irv2d,everyonesmom2,NTA. Should have thrown their gun into the pen with the dog.
6,a1rg3q,t2_168sifcf,Aloafofbread1,"NTA 100 percent, that’s straight animal abuse & I honestly applaud you for breaking their guns."
6,a1rg3q,t2_1qbgxh4c,Palerthanghosts,YTA. You could've just unloaded the gun and gone to the kids' parents.
6,a1rg3q,t2_141sti,HitTheBaby,"NTA, those kids probably wanted you to shoot them so they could contact the police"
6,a1rg3q,t2_1hz0c4e,hipopper,NTA. Find the kids parents and let them know they are torturing animals. These kids are fucked up. 
6,a1rg3q,t2_200pdk4o,Whiteboy408,"NTA all the way, those kids are little assholes for shooting that dog."
6,a1rg3q,t2_2bpq13nd,PurpleProboscis,You gave them one more chance than I would have. NTA.
6,agme1n,t2_20rvwj1o,QueenCp,"YTA. You seem like you have an attitude. It probably came thru in your ""apology"" "
6,ahifgc,t2_7eent,Drewinator,Gonna say NTA with the context here but if you just completely stopped helping around the house and with the baby that's not cool imo. 
6,b8ew44,t2_2kqzj3jn,feedbacksandwich,"YTA. Why are you in shock and disgusted? And no. As a guest you do not get to yell, dictate and control. "
6,b8ew44,t2_9us65kz,SmallKangaroo,"YTA - it’s his fucking house, he can do what he wants "
6,b8ew44,t2_801f63,listeriosis69,YTA. It's his house... He can have whoever he wants over. 
6,b8ew44,t2_mr5lx,Iconoficons,"YTA, you don’t get to dictate anyone’s sex life but your own. Especially at their house, Jesus....."
