I'm assuming you're an adult, and if you're not financially dependent on them at all then who says you have to spend time with them at all? Why would you want to be around hateful and ignorant people who make you sad. I hope you have a good support system elsewhere in your life with people who treat you the way a family should. "
5,alro7y,t2_cxmhejk,SpaceAgeHamburger,"YTA for violating the privacy of your friend's phone. You should have asked first and made it clear why and how much it meant to you. If they still wouldn't delete them, that would make them a dick. It's understandable that you wanted the pictures deleted, but think of it this way: if someone got hold of your phone and deleted something, or downloaded something, or messed with it, wouldn't you consider that a jerk move regardless of their motivation?"
5,alro7y,t2_1n7ia2ai,UnknownNaiad,ESH - yeah you accidentally sent the photos but that’s the risk with social media of any kind. Digging in someone else’s stuff makes you super intrusive. She sucks for teasing you if you asked her to stop and she didn’t. You need to learn physical boundaries and she needs to learn emotional ones. 
5,adwxny,t2_2m8od169,stevencri,"YTA. Live Dave said, you waited until pretty last minute to change things after he already bought a place. You didn’t give him too much of a heads up in finding a new place/new roommate either. It probably would’ve been cheaper for Dave to live in a split house, and he probably still wants to live with you, but now it’s too late. You should’ve considered your options earlier instead of 2 weeks before Dave moves into his new house. "
5,aka65b,t2_13v81yzn,CariadChavez,"YTA - I'm so sorry, because I really feel you on this, but the reason you get to go to your fancy school is because your father is doing what he's doing. This is classic teenage girl stuff, especially first generation teenage girl stuff. These high school girls will evaporate in a few years, and they all hate each other anyway. Your father loves you and you've hurt him. Apologize, try to make it right and sleep safe in the knowledge that people who would judge your father for working hard to give you a better life are not people whose opinion matters much of anything."
5,aka65b,t2_vkzyd20,Min_sora,"YTA - Your dad is working to give you a life he couldn't have, and you care more about what some random girls who aren't even your friends think. In a decade you won't even know where these girls are and you'll feel like a spoilt brat for treating your dad this way. "
5,aka65b,t2_1o426oy,margaretyewong,"YTA. But I’ve been in your shoes. Immigrant parents and I went to a rich all-girl Catholic school. You don’t get it now, but you will when you’re older. Your dad is doing all of this for you. So that you have every opportunity that he didn’t. Private school, extracurriculars, nice things, college. Go give your dad a hug and apologize. If these girls were really your friends, they would understand. If they aren’t, then they really won’t matter in the long run."
5,aka65b,t2_fjn38jd,looCsIyerT,"YTA, for reasons you clearly stated >So am I an asshole for being a stuck up teenage girls who yells at her dad for trying to make ends meet? side note: literally none of the people you've described are worth talking to, much less an argument with a parent."
5,a4hfkv,t2_jeme7,OffnOnWriter,"Your question is off based. It's not about whether you're an asshole for not liking Christmas (you're not), it's whether you're an asshole for what you said to your mother (you are). \- I doubt she cared whether you hung one ornament or not, it was about having that time together. \- you say no and then tell her you don't care, and then tell her you thought she did all the decorating and Christmas celebration for herself, which makes it sound like you think she's incredibly self-absorbed. &#x200B; I'm not sure about all the rest you say she talks about; sounds like this opened the floodgates to a couple of topics. YTA for how you handled that though."
5,a4hfkv,t2_ein62sy,nickrashell,"YTA. Perfectly fine to not be into Christmas. However you obviously know your mother is, and that it means a lot to her. To insinuate her motives, saying it’s only for her, is extremely rude. I mean you have to know that it’s a heartbreaking thing for a mother to hear her child doesn’t care about Christmas anymore, but you stated it bluntly and then followed it up by saying she is tossing her childhood baggage on you. So now, not only does she think you don’t want to participate in Christmas but she feels like a burden on the rest of her family which is the exact opposite of what she wanted. Your still young, and seem pretty bright and have well drawn out conclusions you’ve thought about. But if you love your mother, sometimes it’s about enduring it for their sake. Not making them feel bad when really to you it isn’t hurting you in any way other than being slightly annoying. When your 28 and on your own you’ll regret the times you didn’t avoid hurting her when you could’ve just played along, especially if she is a good mom otherwise. If you are me anyway, you may be different but that’s my experience,"
5,a4hfkv,t2_2et7shtd,AMJ_CSP,NTA. But this is obviously a big deal for your mom. if you get along with her in other ways and aren’t busy - why not help her decorate?? If your relation is strained already - then I can see not wanting to help her. 
5,b3hq29,t2_1szolp7k,Strickout,"NAH He's not your ex, but i can see why your Fiance might be a little skeptical about you remaining in contact with your ex's immediate family. Try sitting down and talking to her, maybe simple reassurance that you aren't using him as a cover to see your ex again or something will help. But remember, Happy Wife(Almost), happy life, i think the best thing you can do is just talk to her, see if she has a specific reason it makes her uncomfortable and discuss from there; and you may need to go into the conversation expecting to not change her mind."
5,b3hvgo,t2_1lvya3g0,crinklebosslava,"I’m going to say YTA. It’s hard to say whether the employee was really condescending based on your saying it was condescending. By facts, the employee is right. You broke a rule. He chose to enforce it. You also seem to agree the facts were on his side. Your main contention is his condescending tone. I think you could have handled it another way. You handled the situation by saying in beginning it wasn’t a problem the past four years and you spend a lot of money there. True. But said like that, it just smells entitled. You didn’t really acknowledge you broke a rule. What you could have said was - I know we went over the time. Can you do us a favor. I didn’t know it was a big problem. THEN state what you had stated about past four years and 25000. Admit fault which you did do. Then ask for the favor and why you deserve it. And if you have a problem with the tone, say it to his face directly! "
5,aw1a97,t2_nyawr,osliver88,"NTA. If he asked for your opinion, he shouldn't be mad that you gave him one and it didn't agree with his. when he responded with agressiveness, though, you probably shoulda just defused it and walked away instead of meeting him with more aggression. "
5,aw1a97,t2_13orl7ae,Bingalingbean123,"NTA- but there are ways of being honest without being hurtful. If you knew he just wanted validation perhaps just do that next time...or say something like “I love this, this and this, your making excellent points. If I had any criticism I’d change the structure, or try this, this and this. But, what do I know, if you’re happy with it go for it” Having tact when on these circumstances goes a long way. "

You can't pass 7th grade English if you write an essay with out a thesis and none of the paragraphs flow together."
5,aw1a97,t2_2g8bx0et,BlindfoldedZerg,"NTA, be honest in your opinion. However, a good technique is to first find the things you like about it (surely there is something there that you like) compliment him on those things, and only then tell him what you think needs improving. Edit: However, even if he uses ""heavy hitting words"" towards you, there is no reason to do ""the same thing back"". You will only make enemies that way. Just leave it there. Now, I'm not saying that you are the asshole if you do retort back, it's just not how you make friends."
5,aiv7nb,t2_mk8p3,iamasecretthrowaway,"I'm really torn. I think either youre NTA or maybe you were an asshole-but-justifiable? If you feel bad for how you reacted, it never hurts to apologize and discuss the situation with the teacher. Maybe say something like ""i wanted to apologize for raising my voice the other day. I was worried, but that doesn't excuse shouting at you; it won't happen again"". But I absolutely wouldn't apologize for keeping your health private (she doesn't need to know your medical problem in front of the entire class. If she *does* need a reason, she could speak with you privately. And even then she doesn't need to know the details) or for leaving to go to the doctor. Hopefully she's a big enough person to accept your apology and apologize for her actions, too. "
5,aiv7nb,t2_1ix4h2xo,SilverDirt,"Definitely NTA The only reason you needed to give is ""im not feeling well"", she should have left it at that.

5,b9jpwi,t2_r9re08m,Praise3The3Sun3,YTA. On your birthday your close friends are not required to give you anything so be thankful for whatever they do give. A gift inherently isn't a trade it's saying I care enough about you to give you something. It is the gift of compassion your friend feels for you. Even if it's two bottles of lemonade the appropriate response is to down one and tell your friend that's the best fucking lemonade i've ever had and you make him/her believe it!
5,b9jpwi,t2_1e2pt402,lordlemmongrab,"Nta but she will be if she vocalises it. I can appreciate how upset and dissapointing it must be. It doesn't sound like the issue is with the amount spent but the thought that went into it. 21st is a really big birthday. Tell Becky to get Susanne the same style gift for her birthday - petty probably, passive aggressive absolutely but gives Susanne a taste of disappointment. "
5,avxz68,t2_th0iuna,Lobstery_boi,"YTA, ESH, except the girlfriend. She needs to know ASAP. What if she gets pregnant with him? What if she gets stuck with this cheating piece of trash? Your friends are all shitty people for their complicity in keeping this douchebag's dirty secret. You have the opportunity to do the right thing and tell her what's been going on. Could you inform her either anonymously or as a secret between the two of you? It is *IMPERATIVE* that she finds out the truth as soon as possible."
5,avxz68,t2_2em5b6id,Vigilant1e,"Jesus Christ you are all cold, unforgiving bastards to be saying ESH. Ofc you're NTA. You haven't done anything wrong, you were *told not to say anything* and it's not particularly any of your business. You aren't obliged to say anything. Then again you have the power to save this girl a lot of heartache. After 4 years she must be considering spending her life with this guy and doubtless she would want to know about this before she commits to him."
5,avxz68,t2_10rc63x7,reddit2procrastin8,"YTA, it's is absolutely not your place to say anything. What he did was really shitty, but you going around telling people makes you just as shitty. What is the real reason to tell anyone, who has what to gain? No one, you just hurt more people. It seems like you're jealous of him (saying how your friends like him more) and want to destroy the persona he built of himself that obviously you know isn't true. How you interact with him is fine, but understand that he confided in you because he probably felt awful. People cheat for reasons and you may not really know thier relationship. I'm not giving the guy a pass, but what im saying people make mistakes and it harder to forgive than to hate. If he wants people to know, then he can tell them. Don't get involved because that makes you a truly awful person seeking to destroy someone else's life because you don't agree with it"
5,admbml,t2_15c00l,penelope_pig,"YTA. It sounds an awful lot like your wife may be depressed. And if this is how she's always been, you really don't get to complain because you knew what you were getting into. If you don't love your wife anymore and/or don't want to stay married, then get a divorce, but don't go after her sister. You will destroy their relationship, wreck your chances at having a decent co-parenting relationship with your wife, and basically it would make you a huge scumbag. Find someone else after you are no longer married."
5,admbml,t2_2atwddgm,hunnybunchesoflove,YTA. Maybe instead of shitting on your wife and wanting to go after her sister maybe help your life partner out. A drastic change in weight like that could mean she has hormonal issues or has depression. She seems to be suffering alone while you want to go fuck her sister.
5,admbml,t2_h5yhw,Vangey,"NTA You're allowed to feel feelings but keep a lid on that shit, you said she doesn't feel the same way so this accomplishes nothing but making the next Thanksgiving super fucking awkward. If you're unhappy in your marriage run through the list of counseling, therapy and divorce in that order."
5,admbml,t2_1huvltuj,ImRikkyBobby,"NTA bro. You are human. You are allowed to be attracted to more than one person. In fact, we are designed to reproduce with more the one partner. Don't feel ashamed for wanting to be with another woman. The only reason people are stuck with ONE partner at a time is because it's a shitty social construct created by assholes to keep us in check. &#x200B; Sit down wit the sister and carefully explain your situation. Don't tell her you have feelings at first. Tell her about your thoughts on your wife. There's no easy way to tell your wife ""hey, maybe you need to lose weight"". etc. &#x200B; &#x200B;"
5,b1i0tc,t2_2b56o8g8,_fuck_this_shit__,"NTA. Maybe NAH but I’ll get to that later. It sounds like you didn’t mean anything bad by what you said. You sound like you were just trying your best to be a loving and supportive spouse. He shouldn’t have reacted the way he did. It was excessive and rude. However, depression can make people say some things they don’t mean. That’s not an excuse to be a jerk or to treat people poorly, but it is an effect of depression. If he recognizes that he sometimes acts out because of his depression and is actively working to fix it, NAH. But if he doesn’t recognize that his reaction was not good and isn’t working on it, there’s a problem. Maybe try going to therapy with him sometime so that you can discuss these issues and why certain things upset him. Then you can both understand the issue better and address it together. "
5,b1i0tc,t2_2svyz9wg,ldaniellel,"NTA- if you “always” do that and he doesn’t like it, he should’ve said something sooner. It’s clear you were just trying to be supportive and sympathetic despite the fact that he wasn’t giving you a whole lot to work with. If the way you’re communicating with him isn’t working for him, he needs to speak up and communicate that to you. Depression sucks, but he needs to advocate for himself, not blame you when you’re not caring for him in the exact right way"
5,9z43x5,t2_15vx9y,impressivepineapple,"Honestly, YTA. It’s a shared car, which you now have access to almost 100% of the time. Your sister is back for what, 4-5 days? You can’t let her use it during that time? If you’re more comfortable in the car, maybe she is too. Even if she CAN drive the other cars, running errands would be more comfortable in her car. Because it is her car. It’s yours too, but you share it. So it’s partially hers. If you wanted to stay after and talk to friends, you could’ve just told her to pick you up a half hour later so you had more time. YTA for coming up with very shaky reasons not to share when you get the car for most of the time anyway. Edit: I completely missed the fact that you just got your license a week ago. I’m not going to edit my original response, but now I’d say NTA. You’re excited! I remember when I first got my license I wanted to drive everywhere. If you did this next thanksgiving/at Christmas then you’d be the asshole, but the excitement of it being new makes you definitely NTA here. "
5,as96jr,t2_irh3f72,AimMick, NTA. I mean maybe a little harsh with the fuck off. But It seems like you’ve asked him numerous times. Maybe now he will get the hint. Also no baby on earth has been hurt by being held and cuddled too much. Keep doing you. Your baby will be fine. 
5,as96jr,t2_s3vvgeq,lurkylurkeroo,"NTA ""Dad, enough. No - stop. This is the last time I am saying this. Do not comment on our parenting again. You had your children, your time is over.

You do it again after that, I'll make it 3 months, you do it a third time, it'll be a year. Do you get the message? I've had enough. Knock it off.

5,as96jr,t2_8nxk9,LWdkw,"NTA but I think you know that from other comments now! Just wanted to mention that when our LO was younger (now 16 months) he'd actually calm down quicker when he was in the backseat alone because having us right there but not picking him up to hold him was just making him angrier. But I assume you have tried that! (And if not, it's still up to you to decide what you think is best for your kid!)"
5,a4qvsm,t2_lw9tl3o,Kingwryn,NTA - you can only do so much for someone. This dude needs to take a bus and get in a routine for himself then stop moochin off people.

5,9vrn0i,t2_zgedy7o,kalelovescats,"It's not really something that effects you since she's not your property and can make choices about her own body.

5,ava5fh,t2_qsbzn,tilman2015,"NTA Sister knows your views and if she wants you to raise her kids then should be making things as easy as possible for you to do so. Just the burden of raising 3 extra kids is more than I could ever expect someone to do for me. I would also only ask someone that I felt would raise them how I would like them to be raised. Either your sister thinks you will raise her children well or she doesn't. If she does, then she should respect the way you feel is best to do so and if she doesn't then she should find someone that she feels comfortable with. Although, this could be an ESH as you could just let a dying woman feel like she gets what she wants and then raise the kids however you want anyway..."
5,ava5fh,t2_16cvlk,LowRentMegazord,NTA. I'm sure all the Everyone Sucks Here people would happily volunteer to raise three children *in their own home* into an ideology that they vehemently disagreed with. Like if their sister wanted them to raise her kids as Trump supporters they would totally agree to do it. Because you're not all a bunch of hypocrites. 
5,ava5fh,t2_uydf2ts,johnsonj85,"NTA/ESH - I agree with you , but also think you'd be better off saying you would allow them to follow which ever religion they choose. Your children shouldn't have to suffer but I agree with you saying you will love them and raise them to know right from wrong but that she can't put conditions on this. Does she really want them to go into care rather than admit she has no control over their future. "
5,ava5fh,t2_rvvm2,bubblesthehorse,"yta and i say this as a pretty angry atheist myself. When their mother dies, religion will def be one of the things they remember her by. even if your sister agrees to your conditions, you cannot force religion out of these kids, that's just not fair. "

Good for you for showing everyone that atheists are superior."
5,ava5fh,t2_23szwbd5,DeftIndifference,"YTA. Being unreligious doesn’t mean not respecting another’s right to believe whatever they want. That’s what gives Atheists (here!) a bad name. You don’t have to attack or ridicule their religion, to their face, to prove you’re “right”. Take the girls and raise them as well as you can, honoring their mother’s memory. Make the last few weeks of your sister’s life as comfortable as possible and once she passes, move forward with your family as you see fit. "
5,aun6qc,t2_1wgoxii5,DisneyBride28,"NTA I hate these chains. They totally defeat the whole purpose. People aren't paying it forward like ""someone did a good deed for me, now I'll do a random one for someone else"" but are now like social constructs and it boils down to just paying for food you didn't order. If you feel any karmic awkwardness do a random good deed for someone somewhere. It doesn't have to involve money...otherwise, no worries. "
5,a8xtll,t2_ulnz4,shhh_its_me,"YTA I'm not sure what you were thinking. was it something like ""Eh the baby doesn't care and won't remember""? The problem with that is the parents still love the baby and it's still their child it's not a sub-person because it doesn't know what's going on. You excluded one of their children intentionally. Excluding one person often feels like ""I don't like that person"" Brother is not the asshole because he didn't demand a gift your mother texted to tell you. "
5,a8xtll,t2_2j07y9lc,zemblan_king,"YTA. I feel like asshole is a strong word for this situation, because it’s not really a huge deal, but I do think it would have made sense just to buy something small for the baby.

Trans just means transitioning genders. Which can be important to people but it doesn't need to be their entire identity. They're transitioning to female, cool, great, they don't need to bring up the fact that they're trans all the time when it's an obvious fact and everyone already knows. It kind of sounds like they're more trying to convince themself than anything else. Edit: She does need to specify that she's trans female when it comes to meeting new people though, especially potential romantic partners, because it could be dangerous for her otherwise. However, if she's mostly doing it in the friend group/around people who already know then my original statement still stands"
5,b6i6nc,t2_28qy0gmb,concealed_brainfart,"NTA. Just like you don't need to call yourself a cis-girl all the time, she doesn't need to call herself a trans-girl all the time. Sounds like she's not as happy/confident with her decision yet as she would like or pretend to be, which is only confirmed by her going off on you. In that light, it's understandable though that a nerve was struck when you brought it up but that's no reason to go off on you therefore she's a bit of an asshole. "
5,b6i6nc,t2_an8ub,alexds1,"YTA, mostly for not doing your research and assuming what her reasoning might be. The transgirl/ transwoman experience IS a feminine experience. But it's also a specific one to transwomen. Adding the modifier doesn't make you less of anything, any more than me saying I'm an Asian woman does. It just means that this is a specific type of experience, since there is no universal way to be a woman. I should add that labels might not be important to you because you benefit from being in the majority group. But finding your place is very important to a lot of people, and so is finding your right label. If you want to support your trans friends in the future maybe listen to more conversations by trans folx online or via podcasts or in person, and not offer advice or suggestions about an experience you don't personally share."
5,b6i6nc,t2_lrrje72,thefirstdetective,"YTA - but not on intention. You tried to help her, but she probably took it as ""your problems as a transgender don't matter"".

Just tell her you can not really understand what she's going thru, you tried to convince her, that you see her as a woman and that you wanted her to see herself that way, since you thought it would make her more happy, so basically you made a mistake out of good intentions."
5,b6i6nc,t2_hsmto,avast2006,"Mildly YTA. I can understand why you would think what you thought. If she is constantly saying she isn't ""_enough_ like a girl,"" then sure, from your perspective it looks like adding the trans label would be distancing herself from what she says she wants to be. When she's identifying who she is, the trans label is present, front and center; when she is discussing what she feels she isn't enough like, the trans label is conspicuously absent. You're not crazy for noticing that disconnect, in the context that she is constantly talking about it from that angle. That said, however, I would suggest you don't try to counsel her on what to label herself. That's her job, not yours. She has to figure it out her labels for herself; you don't have to advise her. I don't think you would be an asshole if you told her, ""okay, I don't understand, because I'm not going through what you are. But it's not okay to swear at me over not understanding. You expect me to be civil to you, I expect the same. If you keep blasting me with profanity I'm not going to be willing to discuss it with you. If you keep accusing me of not actually being your friend, eventually I will agree with you. """
5,b6i6nc,t2_2t10qucp,MaterialCorgi,"NTA Some people want it both ways. They want the social points for being ""trans"" while simultaneously claiming they're just like any other girl when convenient or best suited to get what they want. Hard to consider someone genuine when they act like that."
5,b6i6nc,t2_9p08h,ennuithereyet,"While I can understand where you're coming from and I know you meant well with it, YTA. It's not your place to tell her what she should call herself. Telling her to stop calling herself trans probably sounded to her like you're trying to erase that part of her identity, even though it's probably really important for her because it has shaped many of her life experiences. That being said, you were trying to help. I would just apologize for not realizing how important the term would be to her, and I'm hoping you can move on from it and continue your friendship. "

They were probably the only people that even came close to understanding what she was going through. They are also the last link she had to him. Loosing a partner is crushing. It’s a harrowing experience you never truely ‘get over.’ She will always love him, but that does not mean she can’t love you. You suck because you were unfair when you asked her to cut off all contact. That shows you don’t respect what she went through. She sucks too. She should respect your feelings and your partnership. It sounds like she’s not listening to your needs. It’s unfair of her to not balance her time better. She needs to asses if she really wants to be in this relationship and make some adjustments. If she wants to be with you she needs to compromise, she needs to make you feel loved and important. She needs to make time to spend with your family because it’s important to you. You both suck. You both need to be more empathetic and respectful of each other’s needs. "
5,b41w0n,t2_m2yg6,cruisetheblues,"YTA but only because you want her to stop talking with the family. You're not wrong to feel upset about her brushing you and your family off. The conclusion you should have come to is that she's not ready for a new relationship, not that she should stop talking with them. The fact that you're now ignoring each other says that neither of you two is very invested in your relationship. But, see if counseling and/or an open and honest adult conversation about the issue would help. Maybe you two should be together and you both need some perspective."
5,b41w0n,t2_u6iy3,MayAnneEgg,"YTA. I think you need to recognize the grief she might not even herself realize she’s still processing. That said, it sounds like she has no business being in a relationship right now. Shaming her about it isn’t going to help anything either... break it off and let her process her grief."
5,arg441,t2_qim1c00,bskw_99,You’re NTA but if you’re confident then there’s no harm in taking one to ease his mind as well. Just do him the solid every now and then. It’s really not a big deal if you’re not pregnant. Sometimes people just have anxiety about these things. I certainly do.

The father might have looked away bc he's embarrassed at not being able to give them as nice a meal but you said he was probably planning one. And what's up with the 'take out it is' comment? Just weird man. It's not wrong to just say 'I didnt make enough for unexpected guests'. Why you gotta be so weird about it? Edit: I agree that not saying anything, or just saying thank you for the compliment would have been better. Nobody asked for food, it's just assumptions by @OP."
5,azbqau,t2_266g0q78,TheAngelicKitten,"NTA. The kid said he was hungry and you responded on the fly. Idk exactly how it was said, I just know you felt like you couldn’t ignore the comment. The dad pushing it further and saying, “Not really” or whatever was kind of awkward. I get why your response was a bit awkward. What the heck were you supposed to say? Some people are telling you what you said was wrong, but not giving an alternate answer because they don’t have one. Others are telling you what you should’ve said when they have had time to think about it and don’t feel pressured. You aren’t a jerk for not feeding them. You aren’t a jerk for what you said. Even if people want to deny it, they have had many time when they didn’t know what to say! Now, I get that it made you feel awkward, but saying Chris should come over less because of that is silly. I 100% understand wanting to avoid feeling awkward. However, I’d only worry about it if it happens again. The way I was raised, what they did was really rude. Pulling the parents aside and discussing it might offend them. That could hurt their friendship. I’ve learned people aren’t very receptive to directness. Having Chris come over less doesn’t mean this will never happen again. I will say I don’t think it will though. Don’t change how much Chris comes over. Now that you have some ideas of how to respond use them next time, IF it happens. I did see some good responses. Offering a snack is a good move if you’re specific about what you have to offer. I want to add, you could just let the parents respond to the child. If I said, “I’m hungry.” My mom would probably tell me we’ll eat when we get home, and tell me to be patient. You’re not a jerk, it was just a weird situation. "

5,azbqau,t2_1wb4j340,8bitProtagonist,"YTA or twist my cold heart NAH. You're jumping to a LOT of conclusions, and they all have a sad ending. Maybe they wanted to see the home/family where their son is spending his time. They complimented you and your home. You make it sound like they showed up like a bunch of beggars from Oliver Twist. This happened once. You can handle it if it happens again, and I encourage you to pepper your future responses with more compassion. And don't be punitive about Chris by restricting access. You're a grown ass woman. Nobody has offended you. "
5,azbqau,t2_kyx6cnt,msbasicbitch,"NTA. I think it’s fair to feed Chris whenever he comes over to visit your son, his friend. I don’t think you should put a limit on how often Chris comes over for the sole reason you don’t want to feed him. What if they go to the park to play or elsewhere but then come home hungry? You only going to feed your kid. That said, I think it’s ridiculous the whole family expected to be fed when they showed up. I think it’s fair you turned them away. Could you say to Chris that you’re happy to feed him but that you can’t feed his whole family? Not enough food, already cooking a lot, can’t/unwilling to plan for his family etc. "
5,azbqau,t2_o9jr6tg,bobshallprevail,"YTA not for denying the family a meal but for telling your child not to bring his poor friend over as much because YOU felt guilty and awkward. You had every right not to invite them to dinner, please don't feel bad about that part though. "
5,azbqau,t2_362cbgi2,ebenfalz,"NTA. Still I find it a little odd that a singular event rearranges the whole situation for poor Chris. I think OP shouldn't act as if this was the new normal and now they're always in front of her house begging for food. This might have been a one time thing and Chris gets all the blame. Also, while simply ambushing OP is an asshole move, we all can see where they are coming from. How is your community dealing with poorer people? Can something be organized to help this family? "
5,azbqau,t2_15vw4l,littleredteacupwolf,"NTA. I agree you could have worded it differently, but it’s also really weird that everyone had to come pick Chris up around dinner time (after I’m sure he’s talked about the yummy food he gets there) and then they all got out of the car for one kid needing to go to the bathroom? Nah, that was hinky. But I don’t think you should uninvite Chris because of his parents actions."
5,azbqau,t2_oy7iu2i,grannyknot,NTA I suggest not telling your son how often he can bring his friend around though. You might be really helping out a person in need and helping him avoid a shit show at home. He might wind up being grateful to you his whole life and you might change the course of his in a positive way. 
5,azbqau,t2_1q8kike,AfternoonEnd,"I'm leaning more towards NTA, but if you really answered the way you did, then YTA. I don't really blame you, but I was once like that poor family, and you are a great person for even caring enough to feed Chris in the first place and while you had no obligation to feed the unexpected family, you could have said it in a ncier way. The ' well I'm sure your parents have a nice dinner planned' comment is kind of weird. I mean, what if the kids didn't get anything to eat that day, but you said that and they naturally hoped that it would be something nice. And the 'take-out' comment also kind of strange. I mean if the that turned his head, he could've been ashamed since he couldn't provide for his family. Either way, you did what you did. But do try not to push Chris away, he might be feeling ashamed of what happened, especially if you suddenly don't let him come over. Good luck, OP "

I’m going to say 9/10 chance your wife did all the planning for this party. All the power means the ability to do and invite whoever she wants. You could have inserted yourself at any point (something she likely would have loved) and invited your side of the family. Don’t act like you couldn’t have. It would have taken five seconds on Facebook likely.

You can still be there for the important parts. Sometimes “family first” means *take care* of family first. More money = a better life for your wife and child.

If the customer is kind about it then whatever, just fix it. If the customers being a dick, then just wait and talk shit later. If you were a dick about it, then I'd understand why she would be mad, but she shouldn't have talked shit in front of you nonetheless. Considering how you seem to empathize with people in the job though, I highly doubt you were being rude about it. She shouldn't have said anything infront of you, so you are well in your right to complain. If she gets fired it is her fault for talking bad about a customer infront of them. As a person in customer service it is essential to never assume you can't be heard or understood.

This is pretty immature of her, so I'm assuming you guys are both pretty young. 21-23 She definitely needs to learn and grow from this. If she can't, you need to leave."
5,b01xst,t2_13upo0,pittsburgpam,"NTA at all! I am so sorry this happened but don't let it bring YOU down. You have seen that you can get along quite well in social situations that you find interesting, and others find your interesting too. &#x200B; I am an introvert, basically quiet and shy. One time I went to a party with my ex-husband at his boss's place. I know I am quiet, prefer to listen to people, but I put out a REAL effort to be talkative. On the way home I thought about how much I had talked and felt uneasy, wondering if I had made a fool of myself. The next day my ex came home from work and he said his boss asked him if there was anything wrong because, he said, that I had hardly said a word."
5,b01xst,t2_129zot,Nicola_BearNicc,"NTA , how immature of her! Sounds like she didn't want you to be more social she just wanted you to have enough of a good time so she could be your saviour who is helping take you out of your shell. Crazy "
5,b01xst,t2_s24a0,Texastexastexas1,"NTA She thought you are her project that needs fixing. She sounds immature, childish, and insecure. She basically threw a pouty-baby fit. My husband is an aspie r/aspergers and deals with your same issues. I would be so proud of him!!"
5,b01xst,t2_gi6jj,Compactsun,NTA either sounds like she was just thrown or there was something else going on that you missed cause you're a self admitted 'social neanderthal'. Ignore all the relationship advice in this thread. 
5,b01xst,t2_2xg2481w,sweetnectart,NTA How is she gonna encourage you be more social and be yourself around others and then get mad when you actually do? Sounds like she acts like she wants you to be more social but in reality she doesn’t. 
5,aayffj,t2_nvmmo,Eilayth,"YTA for the way you handled it, not your decision. Grading her the way you did seems fair, you gave an explanation (not sure how you got the percentages and how the other 2 lost the 2%, but it doesn't matter here). The issue comes when she comes to ask about it. Okay, you told her her voice didn't fill the room properly. And then, instead of offering her advice on how to improve (which should theoretically be the point of any class), you told her to just get over it and that her feelings weren't valid, because you deemed it so. "
5,aayffj,t2_luz12,kellasong,"YTA, because based on what you said, it seems like you judged her based on what her peers who did the same poem did rather than a rubric. She sounds like she still fulfilled the requirements even if you didn’t like her reading as much as the other ones. Furthermore, you are an adult, and telling her to stop complaining is a pretty immature way of handling the situation imo. Why did she immediately learn what the other peoples grades were? Did you announce them/show them to the class? "
5,aayffj,t2_ixcff0b,jackalnapesjudsey,"YTA I think you could have been more sensitive to the fact she was upset about it. Obviously you should change the grade if you stand by it, but it wasn’t helpful to essentially tell her to get over it. There could be several reasons this has upset her, maybe she has super strict parents or feels inferior and is struggling with self confidence. Telling someone to stop complaining doesn’t really add any benefit. It seems like explaining it again and telling her she did great and give her a few pointers would help more. Also, isn’t the correct word, proceeded, and not preceded? "
5,9u9gzo,t2_owz3mu7,Janaelle5,"NTA on both points, which feels weird for me. Normally I'd say she doesn't have to share her friends with you, but if you're actively fighting on if you can hang out with her friends, friends she's been intimate with, that's just straight up abnormal. I'd be worried, too, because it sounds like she's hiding you and that's never good."
5,ay6cj0,t2_363j16gy,seenyourscars,"I think YTA if you demand it. So what? Maybe he’s just never felt that need to show off his relationship. I totally get that you might be a bit curious as to the reason why, but once he tells you it’s nothing why not just believe him instead of demanding he posts photos. "
5,aq066o,t2_1b3is2rp,ground__contro1,"High schoolers gossip and maybe you should have been more careful with how you handled the situation. Announcing it like that takes away your ability to chose what happens. Maybe he was trying to give you free drugs or maybe he didn’t know what he was giving you, but in either case I don’t get the impression that *you think* he should be fired/in trouble over it. But now it’s more or less out of your control. You’re NTA, but next time maybe play your cards closer to your chest until you have a chance to consider the situation. "
5,artjjm,t2_bz6q2,Atlanshadow,"NTA but I would give him a very clear ultimatum before telling the boss. Just be like, hey man, I really don't care what you do but if I see you do it in front of me again I think I have to tell the boss. It puts me in a really uncomfortable position and I'm just an apprentice- we cool?"
5,b94tbi,t2_11igcq,apathyontheeast,"NTA. Put yourself in his shoes - would you want someone to let you know? Do try to be courteous about it, though. ""Hey, X, you're a great guy and I like having you here. It's awkward, but I wanted to let you know that your personal hygiene thing might not be working out for you. I wouldn't say anything if I didn't think you were a great guy."" Alternatively, ask the supervisor to do it. "
5,b0kall,t2_23wzglbf,doggoshennanigans,"NTA - It seems to me that he’s trying to shame you into keeping quiet about your own opinions and wishes. This is not healthy. I’m not sure how well you two normally communicate, but this is not working. Perhaps when neither of you are eating you could sit down with him and discuss how this makes you feel. If he continues to do this, reevaluate your relationship and decide for yourself if this is a good, healthy, loving relationship/environment and if you wish to continue. Good luck, OP. I hope things work out for you."
5,b0kall,t2_1n2iefrx,bighero6shaped,"NTA you have every right to feel this way. He needs to step up and take care of a few things to keep the house a little more clean. I get it, I'm not the cleanest person but at the same time he needs to understand that a few little things would make you happy and also help around the house. To me it sounds like you guys need to sit down and have a conversation about it before it gets to both of you. Let him have some small victories such as maybe paper plates at the computer. But also give some responsibility to pick up his towel and maybe sweep the house. If he has to sweep then he might understand that things not picked up he has to pick them up to sweep."
5,b0kall,t2_u9rrbnb,Smallerbuttercup,"Lol god I hate this my fiance is the same way I give him cutlery he eats with his hands NTA, update if you find a solution"
5,b0kall,t2_d51ja,twogunrosie,"NTA. I think this is a big red flag, Sweetie. If you're taking care of him now - just like his mommy - don't kid yourself into thinking that is going to change anytime soon. Especially when you take his attitude into consideration. He clearly doesn't give a shit about cleanliness or neatness and it's very obvious he was raised with no manners whatsoever. He complained that you are treating him like a five year old?? That's because he is behaving like one!! Contrary to what too many women think, you are not going to change him. So you've got a choice. You can take this as a sign and move on without him. Or you can accept the fact that you *ARE* his mommy (and his personal maid) and will be for the rest of his life."
5,af02nn,t2_1fcjdbhq,AnarchoNAP,"YTA Trying to break people up outside of abuse is always asshole. You claim to love him, but you want to mess up his relationship. I don’t think you know what you want because if you did you wouldn’t have broken up with him. I kinda think you want what you can’t have. How can you guarantee that you’ll want to stay with him this time if he leaves his gf? "
5,af02nn,t2_1lvc81je,P_Flange,"YTA. So trashy. You had your chance and you fucked it up. Now that he's moved on and is happy, you realise you've made a mistake and want to disrupt that. Don't you deserve to be happy? Not if your happiness means disrupting the happiness of two other people like that. You're also pretty arrogant thinking he's just going to drop this girl that he's happy with for the bitch who broke his heart. You've made your bed, now you get to lie in it."
5,af02nn,t2_zr7v6,RedFloodles,"YTA - you break up with him, which is no great crime. You're allowed to date/not date whoever you want. But you're an asshole if you now start playing stupid games. Actions have consequences, and the consequence of you leaving him is that he's now moved on and is happy with someone else. Also, I wouldn't be so sure he'd take you back..."
5,9xssts,t2_10uwve,MrFluffPants1349,"NTA, but you probably already knew that. Good on you for taking a stand, though. When someone shows you that big of a red flag it's important to pay attention to it. A lot of people your age ( around 16, I'm assuming) might try to brush it off, it says a lot about you making the mature decision to not tolerate that behavior and ending it. And ripping into her for it, NTA either. Some people need a reality check. You probably did her a favor. Hopefully she learns something from it"
5,am8v5w,t2_xqxzr,catcog,"NTA Sara seems to have made it pretty clear that your group isn't as important as her other friends. That, reasonably so, has put you off her. It doesn't sound like this has much to do with her being depressed. You've made considerable efforts to keep the group going, but friends tend to drift apart as their lives change. This can be sad. Soon you'll have a new group of friends. Enjoy your next adventure!"
5,aputk9,t2_gitkg,pm_me_your_molars,"NTA. 3 weeks is hella early to say ""I love you"". I get why you felt the pressure to return the statement, though you shouldn't have said it if you weren't ready, and that is definitely contributing to the shitty situation you're in now. If you make this mistake in the future after learning better, YTA."
5,b20eo5,t2_3d79gykc,SoniSoni67432,"NTA but you need to come to a mutual understanding of how your finances will work. Please pardon me but she sounds quite immature if you can't even have a joint bank account because she's so financially irresponsible. You're not her dad to ""let"" her do things and give her allowance. And when I say that, I'm not accusing you of being controlling: she needs to grow up and change. Or earn her own money if she wants these items so badly. This is a tangent and my own personal thing but as a woman I could never imagine putting my financial security in someone else's hands and having to ask for money."
5,b20eo5,t2_vrant1v,princesspeachbottom,"YTA: for describing it as “letting her buy expensive clothing” it sounds like you are holding the fact you earn the money above her head, like she is not an equal person in deciding what to do with the money you both have earned. As far as I am concerned a SAHM is just as entitled to the household money as you are. YTA for making her feel like you get to make the choice what happens to the money. You knew how she was. Although, I do agree that you two should come to a compromise, she does not need to spend that much, but if she wants to, then you need to validate her feeling on that and tell her your side also, communicate and come up with a compromise. She could feel trapped and grow resentment if you stay on this track. "
5,b20eo5,t2_4jhvb,waterproof13,"YTA For the language and thinking of “ allowing” your wife things. What you should do is make a budget, together, which should include a number for clothes, and then she can do with her allotment what she wants. Be prepared to compromise."
5,9v2shd,t2_vbln5,lucillebluth1213,"NTA. It's great that she's excited but it's not her shit to share. If she can't be trusted with pics/info, then don't give them to her. Also you saying that she's been depressed for awhile and this has made her really happy is a giant red flag to me that she'll say things like she *needs* the baby because the baby will make her happy/cure her depression. "
5,asy9pq,t2_8jtdwrt,yellowromancandle,"NTA, and yikes. If your friend can afford a shopping spree, she can afford to pay for her own food. Maybe have a sit down with her and ask her if there’s some financial constraints you aren’t aware of? And if she truly cannot afford to pay for food to go out, maybe start having more nights in together if the friendship is important for you to maintain. "
5,aej8eu,t2_2lpnthfj,theuserie,"You’re NTA, but I can understand why she thinks you are. If you knew your toddler wanted to say good night, and you kept talking to your friend on the phone instead, that would be heartbreaking. She probably thinks that you should have called back to ask her what was up/if it was something important, because your son is in her care, so any communication could potentially be about him and thus, more important than any other phone conversation. Based on the text screenshot you posted, it also sounds like she suspects you were talking with a potential romantic partner, not a friend, and that’s why it was so important that you couldn’t even call your baby. (Her possible words, not mine. LOL.) So no, you’re NTA. But she’s probably (over-)analyzing every single thing you do and say right now, and sees this situation as the first step in you moving on and away from her and the kid - whether that’s true or not. "
5,aej8eu,t2_2or3lauo,thisisatestabc123,"NTA. I doubt she even cares about the goodnight thing. She’s just weirded out that you talk to this guy so much and is using your kid to guilt you. But if you all are actually separated, it’s really none of her concern who you talk to on the phone. "
5,aej8eu,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,"NTA. I think she’s given you her reason. She thinks something is going on. Dude, I don’t think this is going to end well. I’ve been in a similar situation. Separations rarely help relationships. As you can see, in addition to whatever problems caused you to separate, you now have new problems that will further complicate matters. She’s paranoid that you’ve found someone new. Maybe she’s found someone new and is projecting. Maybe she hasn’t, but she may convince herself that you have and then find someone new herself. "
5,aej8eu,t2_k6ke2,cayg118,"NTA because you didn’t know your son wanted to talk until the next day. If she had texted you he was asking for you, and you still ignored it, you would be the asshole. The only thing is you could have put your friend on hold and picked up for your wife just to see if it was important, but I don’t know that you had to if you don’t have that kind of relationship. Lots of guys talk to their other guy friends on the phone for hours, especially if they were childhood or college friends and moved far away from each other. It’s how they stay in touch."
5,aej8eu,t2_1v30kyyr,mckenmad,"NTA I mean. Who cares how long you talk on the phone to a friend. Normal? Probably not common for most married men with families but you’re in a transition so....seems totally normal. You have more free time- I don’t doubt you’re a good Dad. So not telling your little guy goodnight once isn’t the end of the world. It’s not like you knew that he wanted to do so and purposely ignored it. If it were an emergency she would have called again and sent text messages..so, it’s ok you didn’t swap over. Next time for the sake of your own guilt- ask her to send a text if your son is specifically asking for you- or you send her one. She’s being nosey. Thought you were talking to a girl- because new relationships usually involve lengthy calls..it’s hard not to be the priority anymore (for her not your kiddo). You didn’t answer and her wheels started spinning. When you confirmed you were talking to a guy she already had her mind made up it wasn’t a guy. Now she needs validation for prying. Stop sending her screenshots to prove yourself. You’re allowed to do whatever you want now...why does she think you have to answer to her? Tell her reddit says- relax. "
5,ao0dam,t2_32i08ho5,Zetyra,NTA BUT and this is a huge BUT... This is the person he raised her to be. If he doesn't have an issue with how she treats him then that's his prerogative. You don't have to like her or let her treat you poorly but that is his relationship with his daughter. Trying to change it will likely cause more harm than good.
5,a13vm1,t2_4tqfv,solstice38,"NTA but this is more complicated than it sounds. It sounds as if you do have a deep and valuable relationship. You're both very imperfect but actually pretty well matched. It also sounds like this sickness is really hard on her, and that she's not usually like this. Hang on to each other, talk a lot deeply and truly, and truly listen."
5,arytq5,t2_3013caup,SillyMidOff49,"YTA Yeah...I’m not buying the: “Oh I was just on his phone for a joke” line... we all know why you were. Hence the anonymity or you’d just be posting this completely honesty on your normal account. Sounds like he was dealing with it perfectly well on his own, it’s normal for you to be taken aback by it, BUT you have no right to decide who he does and doesn’t speak to, OR to speak for him. That kind of controlling behaviour is the death of good relationships. "
5,arytq5,t2_94diq,AuditorTux,"**YTA** Look back at what you wrote. Some girl he knew was trying to land him (""can I be your Valentine?"" ""I'll be whatever you want me to be"" ""you seem so sad all the time"") and he kept turning her down (""""I'd rather just be friends."" ""thanks"" ""I already have someone""). And you decided yourself to block her. >He said some girl he tried being friends with but it's not working out. So I was like why? You have (Kaitlyn) and (Jessica) and all your guy friends? Why do you care if he's making new friends? He's already proven (in this case) that he has limits and he's not going to break them. He's been loyal to you when given *multiple* chances. One thing I've learned over the years - the more you make something taboo, the more people start to want that."
5,arytq5,t2_2xij40bi,tinsilprincess,"YTA. Why would you feel the need to message her and block her from your BOYFRIEND's phone when you saw that he was clearly not interested in her and was handling it very well? I never understand how you can just go through your other half's phone, especially with someone like your boyfriend (he sounds sincere, atleast in this situation). Do you not feel uncomfortable or embarrased doing so? "
5,arytq5,t2_1ufgz7nx,kapbear,"YTA I don't even understand why you're posting this. He responded great and handled it all very well. So many people wish their boyfriends would talk like this to other women. I don't even see a problem. You accidentally saw something, he explained. Just move on Jesus "
5,axyz94,t2_o8r43,mcbeenis,"NTA. Just block/ghost him if you’re really not confrontational. You don’t owe him anything. If it were me, I would tell him that I wasn’t interested pretty bluntly, but we all have our own styles. If you’re not comfortable with that, then just cease contact. "

Long post short, you may have behaved inappropriately in destroying his stuff (demonstrating that, when mad, it's appropriate to display your anger through destruction) but you had a *damn* good reason. Being a dad is tough, being a *single dad and widower* is unspeakably difficult. What you do from here on out with him could prove to shape his future, just stay strong man. "
5,9ypl3q,t2_2h5zj2cu,PennroyalTea,"NTA. Your actions were a little harsh, and might have demonstrated dealing with anger poorly to your son....but I feel like they’re justified in a way.

You’re a good man and I hope you can pull him out of this stupid bullshit."
5,b6ab91,t2_axtmaip,Rainnv7,NTA - you guys are long distance and don’t really see each other. You’re not selfish for wanting to spend time with just your bf on your bday weekend. You already asked him if he could go and he said yes. Just be honest with him. Tell him you’ve had a really hard week and just want to spend time away with just him on your birthday weekend. Also say that the place you booked isn’t refundable. I’m sure he’ll understand. You planned this first before his friend came out. He can see his friend another time. 
5,auj823,t2_204arzdy,Saints9Fan,"YTA. Totally 100 percent, you sound controlling, if she feels secure with it big deal. Give it back to her an tell her you apologize for being an a-hole an hiding it "
5,auj823,t2_ktsj4,maskaddict,"YTA. You are *so* TA. First of all, you don't get to dictate how your girlfriend dresses. That's not how this works. You're not entitled to tell her what to wear or how she's allowed to style her hair or who she's allowed to be friends with, and you're not entitled to forbid her to wear certain things. You're not her fuckin' boss, dude, and you need to deal with this impulse to control her. You said you were afraid it was an ex's hoodie: What if it was? Is she not allowed to keep anything that came from any previous relationships? What about photos of her from when she was seeing someone else? Or clothes she wore while she was dated someone else? Does she have to get rid of those too? Everyone has a past, and hers isn't your property. This kind of insecurity can lead to seriously toxic relationship behaviour if you don't get it in check. Case in point: You stole something that belonged to her, something that she cares a lot about, and then lied and are continuing to lie to her about it. There's something about her that you don't like, and rather than accepting it as part of the cost of being with her or just ending it and moving on with your life, you took it upon yourself to *steal from her*, from this person you claim you care about, and then *lie to her face* about it. Yeah, you're the asshole."
5,auj823,t2_36ii445z,trullaDE,"YTA, holy shit, really and seriously and 100%. You not only stole it from her lied in her face about it, it's also something you KNOW she loves. That is one hell of a shitty thing to do. If you can't accept she and the hoody are a package deal for now, break up with her, fine, but I just can't get over the fact that you stole from and lied to your girlfriend, and are still not sure that you are an asshole for that. &#x200B;"
5,auj823,t2_35ye0v15,7CuriousCats,"YTA. Reasons: 1. You know she feels secure with it, yet 2. you didn't give a rat's ass and removed it from her, and 3. lied to her about it. 4. You are acting insecure by being scared it is an ex's hoodie - so what? Is your relationship that fragile? She chooses to be with you (unless you continue to be an ass, then she might leave you) 5. You don't like how she looks in it. Wow. You don't get to have a say in what she wears - she's your girlfriend, not your Barbie doll. 6. Your positive suggestions to alter it and offer other hoodies was nice, but that's like replacing your puppy / trimming it's ears for looks and expecting you to be fine with it. Cool move, but a bit ""I know best I'm trying to help you"" instead of ""I'm trying to understand and resonate with you, then later we can think about helping"". 7. Upscale dates dressing I can understand - but you still don't get to say what she wears. You can even compromise and ask her to rather tie it around her waist than wearing it if she wants. Upscale dates are nerve-wrecking as heck and I understand the comfort needed. &#x200B; Honestly, I don't understand the fuss. This shouldn't even be an issue. She might have a real reason for it, like it being her dad's or brother's who passed on and not ready to talk about it. Over time, if your relationship lasts, I would suggest getting to know more about the hoody, and why she is so attached to it. And I don't mean that in a screaming-match way. I mean it in a way that - after you stopped bugging her about it constantly for a while - you ask, something along the lines of ""So, we never got to the story behind the hoody? You really like it, huh? / So, comforting, huh? I can see it makes for a nice blanket... what else do you like about it?"" in a nice, loving, inquisitive, friendly, maybe with a tad of joking tone. It is important to show that you really are fine with her liking it now and came to accept it as part of her - she might actually open up to you then, as she will actually trust you. Then, over time she might even need it less as you become her comfort and happy zone, but that will take time. "

5,auj823,t2_bo6bn,darkrenown,"YTA. If you wanted her to be less dependant on a physical emotional crutch, I could maybe understand your reasoning, even if you went about it in an arse about face way, but your one reasoning is just controlling and a shitty thing to do. she was obviously attractive enough for you to be interested in her with the hoodie before you got together, so why is it an issue now? Or did you come into the relationship with a laundry list of things she should change for you?"
5,auj823,t2_j017v,G_Art33,YTA man give it back and apologize for not finding it at your house sooner. You may really like the girl but her and the blue hoodie aren’t sold separately apparently. I can relate to feeling much better about the way I’m looked at when wearing baggy clothes and if that’s her deal why would you take away her comfort?

I know you said you and he decided that he wouldn't eat that food *together* but really you are the mom, you're in charge. It's your rule he is following at your guidance (and you're 100% right no adult can make him eat something hes allergic to, especially without mom present). He did exactly what he should do. Also, if she knows which foods hes allergic to, why would she serve him a food which youd need to take antihistamines with in the first place? Pick something else for fucks sake. If your mom has anything to gripe about, it would be that this rule wasnt made clear to her prior to this (you dont say if it was or wasn't but it doesn't sound like it). That's not your son's fault. If you decide to try to smooth it over just tell her you're sorry you and her weren't clear on this rule beforehand but he will not be apologizing for refusing to eat something he is allergic to.

By saying “I can’t make him apologize and I support that 100%” you probably have him permission to be rude to your mother for other reasons; kids don’t understand context very well, he probably will respond bad to your mom again in the future and have this moment as reference when you tell him “well that’s different” That’s my opinion anyway ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Edit: lots of downvotes, I don’t care about muh internet points but have the guts to say why you disagree.

I've had a couple dates before where we didn't hit it off, but the guy was cool and a gentleman, so I hooked them up with a couple of my girlfriends. Just, try not to leave before your date does next time, k?"
5,arnjb9,t2_30hzwx1h,ERArcher,"NTA Although I'm on the fence about how you're talking about her, which shows youre a dick. I'm saying NTA because she shouldn't have assumed youd pay for her. I'm also in disagreement with the other commenters saying it should have been discussed beforehand. It is only logical that everything is split half unless you make a note of saying ""let me take you out"" ""or let's gets dinner, my treat"". But as for it probably being a mutual first date thing it's always neutrally split half. HOWEVER! You are a dick for talking shit about her being dumb. It's possible she just really liked you and was nervous and awkward. But as for being an asshole for automatically assuming half. No. "
5,arnjb9,t2_ebqfpe,Watsonmolly,"NTA - of course you should split the bill, but bragging about how much you earn never makes you look good. Rude of her to ask too. "
5,b1zz1x,t2_2ax462e5,basilkiller,"NTA, except maybe to dating the co worker (but I glass house can't throw stones). Either way your ex sucks for talking smack and Samantha sucks for spreading it around, even if you did any of the things you said they did it doesn't effect your job performance and they need to chill. "
5,amietk,t2_11qe30,Maverick8787,"YTA. It’s reasonable at 10 or 11am to expect people to be awake. You were avoiding him and he knew it. Don’t pretend he didn’t know you were home, and don’t pretend you didn’t answer because you were scared. Imagine being in his shoes. This is now the THIRD time you have to ask your roommate to take out the trash, and at this point he’s pretending to not be home rather than just be a grown up and answer the door. You’d be pissed off, and rightfully so. Next time, just do the chores you’re asked to do. It’s disrespectful to your roommate to leave garbage for days on end and ignore him asking you."
5,b2bqx9,t2_qtaeemg,JediAreTakingOver,"YTA - not for your suggestions but the way it appears youve handled this. This sounds more like an attack on the house he bought. Youve literally criticized the colours of half the rooms in the house, you want to replace furniture, you hate this and that. This screams an attack on his lifestyle. You could have started with suggesting A room to repaint. Baby steps. Instead you are literally attacking the whole house at once and probably making him feel like he lives in an ugly house. Nobody likes to be told their baby is ugly."
5,amj73s,t2_dhky2fp,KuhBus,"NTA - You deserve to have a private space and your mom is an asshole for not respecting your wishes and kinda sounds like she's treating your niece like a do-over child. I'm going to suggest a very asshole thing to do: When you find your niece napping in your room, act like she isn't there and ""accidentally"" do loud things that make your room a bad place for her to take a nap. ""Accidentally"" turn on loud music for a moment, slam your door, bang into a cupboard or just move things around. When your mom confronts you, act like you don't know what you did wrong. It's *your* room after all, you didn't see/expect your niece since you didn't invite her into your room etc etc. When you leave for school, leave dirty laundry and other things you don't mind being handled on the bed. Deliberately make it uninviting. If your mom tells you to keep your bed clean, promise to do so... then ""forget"" to clean your bed until your niece is gone. Why, you were so busy with homework/your latest art project/cleaning other things you just didn't do it until now!"
5,a9eard,t2_b7wsj,andeqoo,"NTA. You're being literally abused it's never ok for one adult to hit another adult in a supposedly loving relationship. period. full stop. you are an abuse victim. she may be bipolar, but I'm bipolar too-- being mentally ill isn't an excuse to be an asshole- especially if they're being medicated. unmedicated is a slightly different issue. u gotta take care of u first before you try to help other people, dude. NTA."
5,a9eard,t2_15wzn2vu,KilnTime,"YTA - yes, she betrayed you and is throwing away the relationship, and you should cut her out of your life. But what you are doing is retaliatory. She is clearly in a bad situation for to her mental illness, and if she ever found out you were responsible, they is no telling what she might do to get back at you. Walk away. Or run. "
5,a9eard,t2_ff3sfc9,brucebannerfornow,"YTA for letting someone give you three black eyes. If someone I care for gets loud with me even once, I seriously reconsider keeping them in my life. Hit me? He’ll no. Get out of this relationship. NTA for the car repo. "
5,b4mk4p,t2_coyio,Angry_Feet,"NTA. I’m not really sure how that is even a question though. This kind of seems like a validation post. You clearly (and admittedly, directly in this post) DO care about the cats a lot. You are just not letting yourself dwell on it so as not to make this break up even more difficult. Self preservation doesn’t make you the asshole."
5,9u310p,t2_13qt3c,gabdmm,"I’d say YTA for not allowing her to wear it. Why tell your daughter she can choose her outfit and then when she picks one, not allow it? She’s only four, and if it makes her happy then so be it. You wouldn’t be pushing Christmas early, you’d be allowing you daughter to wear the shirt she wanted. Also, I began wearing my Christmas jumper in October. Mostly because it’s my only jumper that fits me 😂 But I’d wear it in summer if the mood suited me."
5,9u310p,t2_1g6v26br,Cephalopodio,"When I was five I wore my Halloween leopard outfit for MONTHS. Mom let me because I adored that costume (she made it btw) and I was five years old. I think I wore it till I couldn’t fit into it. Sorry dude, YTA"
5,b3xpkj,t2_3g5rj,oorza,"NTA. Your husband is acting really weird. I could understand if it was some random dude, but you want to spend time with your brother. Being alone and chilling with your brother is a perfectly normal and healthy thing to do, and it seems like your husband is being really possessive over the movie thing for some reason. I'd talk to him and see if he thinks it's something that he thought you both thought was ""your special thing""."
5,b73t6k,t2_591w6,Woden888,"NTA- If it had stopped at him showing up in tears and going to you for support, that would be a different story. But the fact that he’s being and has been such a twat, I wouldn’t let him stay with my family either. That being said, I’d recommend talking with him about his attitude and all the rest. If he’s not willing to admit he’s being ridiculous, I’d say no-go on staying. Just my take though."
5,b73t6k,t2_1wnmiqic,Gabbaliciouz,NTA. You say yourself that you would lose your mind if he lived there. His actions led to this outcome he is an adult he should be able to handle it and figure out a solution. It sounds like he didn't want to listen to your advice as it wasn't what he wanted but he doesn't mind using you for somewhere to stay.
5,b73t6k,t2_12cehh,ladykyleth,"NTA He could turn into the friend who will never leave. He could turn into the friend who is always in your business. He could turn into the friend who doesn’t ever leave you alone because they want to hang out and talk all the time. He could be the friend who stressed the fuck out of your already busy wife. The question is is you can have another grown ass adult show up and hang with you in your living room every night? Can you have a needy grown ass person hanging in your living room every night. Is he a talker? Guaranteed if he is, you will get tired of having him talk to fill the silence because he can’t take silence with what he’s feeling right now. Not that I’ve experienced any of this at all...."
5,b73t6k,t2_1iiytsw4,Nexus_3_,"Definitely NTA. Your friend is also being a 'askhole' and those are one of the most annoying types of people. Judging from how he suddenly found a new girlfriend after a relationship of 7 years, I'd say its possible he cheated in the first place. He has his new girlfriend and his new friends. He can stay with them. You don't owe him anything for mistakes he has made in his life. Edit: just read she lives with her parents. He can definitely ask to stay with them. "
5,b73t6k,t2_276qz4k7,Trash_Ninja,"NTA He fucked it up by himself. Also I think that he's lying to you. For Example: where did the thong come from? There is definitely more he doesn't tell you to keep you on his side. I wouldn't trust him - his focus is on himself and his needs. Heck his behaviour sound so fucking self-absorbed, I even bet he would try to bone your wife. Once you're telling him no, his reaction will show his true colours. Stay strong, you WBTA if you ignored your wife's wishes and forced her to live with him "
5,afvqlc,t2_a783x,jackmusick,"I have such mixed feelings about this. On one hand, I really don’t like the idea of a bro code or some rules about how I can and can’t live my life. On the other hand, it’s really kind of bullshit to do that to someone. It’s been done to me. I’ve almost done it to someone (having interest but not doing more than hanging out a few times). Much later when I really started to realize how that would of affected him I just felt ashamed that the thought even crossed my mind. It’s just a shitty feeling. I’m married now but here’s how I look at it. My friend could have dated the woman of my dreams and it wouldn’t matter. There without a doubt is (and was) someone out there, within reach, that was better for me. Mathematically, it’s just impossible for that not to be the case. It really just comes down down to if someone is strong enough to pass a date up for a friendship. Perhaps the only exception is a distant friend you don’t really talk to anymore? I don’t know OP, but you’re NTA and I’m sorry for what you’re going through. "
5,afvqlc,t2_z7pk8,insideoutcollar,"NTA. It's smart of you to distance yourself from him. I feel that keeping the friendship would reopen an old chapter that you've put behind you. Yes, I know everyone here is all ""you can't control who he dates"" or ""you don't own a person"". Doesn't change the fact that it hurts and you have some feeling of betrayal. The only way I can see myself dealing with this is to cut them both out of my life."
5,afvqlc,t2_ke872zy,EarlMarshal,"NTA Yeah, I know he is also just a person and he also deserves happiness, but I would still say your friend is an asshole. I probably would be really mad at him and would struggle with my feelings. So kudos for acting like an adult. You seem to be a good person."
5,afvqlc,t2_11f38g,Akasgotu,"NTA. You're never the asshole for how you feel, only with how act on those feelings. You are actually dealing with this in a rational, healthy way by distancing yourself from the situation. Good for you and I hope that you don't feel the loss of time spent with your friend too keenly."
5,afvqlc,t2_9v811j6,ayyemi,"NTA. Your friend should be understanding ab how this affects you. Though I agree with everyone else saying you have no right to claim a person, seeing a close friend with an ex is painful regardless. It’s your choice on how you want to go about this"
5,afvqlc,t2_5xaao,RiflemanLax,You're not an asshole for being a little upset- we all have feelings- but YTA if you get really pissy about it. People aren't property and can't be controlled as such. He was straight up with you about pursuing her and apparently she has some sort of feelings for him. Time to move on.
5,afvqlc,t2_23jalm8m,Duouwa,"YTA. You don’t own your ex, you can’t decide who can date her. Your mate did everything right by telling you before hand. You two broke up a year ago, so you can’t claim that it’s too soon or some shit. Why can’t your mate date her? Other than some dumb bro code, which is already stupid, what has he done wrong? Is it cause your jealous? If it is, then that’s fine, you can be as jealous as you want, but it’s pretty dumb to throw away a friendship over it. Take a step back and look at what you’re really saying. You’re basically saying, “You can’t date her cause I did it first!” Sounds pretty stupid right? That’s cause it is."
5,afvqlc,t2_1w7pofg3,Bootybustinwitch123,"NTA, he couldve picked someone else, anyone else, but he knowingly picked a girl you still loved. They are adults and do have a right to date but they should have some self awarness of the concequences of their actions.

5,b678ly,t2_swespbk,JerseyShoreWebDev,"NTA Even if she had (somehow) changed, you would be right not to expose yourself to that again. And the way she acted after you told her that you weren't interested says that she probably hasn't changed at all. "
5,b54zgt,t2_58zm3hg,bellagab3,"YTA your son should be your first priority, not how convenient it is for you. Great parents sacrifice for their kids and believe you me, your son will not forget the time he has with you when he grows up and thinks about who was there for him"

"
5,b8eufp,t2_2q288snz,MarieGotLost,"YTA - Though asshole is a strong word for this situation. Sorry you had to go through all that, but wanting your boyfriend to put his emotions aside so he can be there for you - read: have sex - sucks. Of course that’s unfortunate for you, but if one person of the two doesn’t want it, that’s it. Done. He shouldn’t apologize for it, especially since he’s in a bad place right now. That you want him to do it, even though he’s in a bad place and isn’t up for it (so force himself to do it), is astounding to me. Hope you both get through this, best of luck. "
5,b8eufp,t2_1r6b8ht2,Tigercatzen,"ESH You need to respect each other's needs. Try some cuddling, no sexy times. Compromise. That puts less stress on him, and you still get physical contact.

5,b8eufp,t2_j9afo,Salt-Pile,"YTA but I feel bad saying this as I think this is actually a WIBTA question insofar as you haven't actually done the asshole thing (getting angry at him) yet. There's nothing wrong with how you feel, but it's not okay to pressure your partner into sex. There is nothing wrong with how he feels either. It will probably help for you to try and find other ways to comfort yourself so that your intimacy with your partner can be left as something for mutual pleasure/enjoyment when you are both up for it, not as a comfort blanket for you."

5,a822ym,t2_13imw9,Brandelyn1135,"NTA I know plenty of people who have an aversion to eating food brought in by coworkers.

Goat is just not something everyone wants to eat. Next time this happens, you can just say “thank you, but I already had plans”, or “this is great, but I just don’t think it’s for me”. "

5,aolx0v,t2_2ukrm01a,bowerisme,"NTA. I want to give you a perspective that you may not have thought about. Probably the reason you see so many of these qualities from him is that he is comfortable around you. His habits are stress and anxiety releases from being over-stimulated. The fact that he does them around you shows how comfortable he is around you. You are a special friend and person to him. Congratulations on being a safe person for him.

He could just have told you ""I'll stay up late with my friends"" and that would be ok by my standards, but it wasn't the case. Also him inviting to stay someone (I assume he knows) you are not comfortable with, without telling you or anything is something I really don't like. > he has a history of hitting on his friends’ girlfriends and just generally being creepy The big asshole here.

5,apfrva,t2_2wzp8r3n,evilrobotlizard,"NTA, this kind of stuff is really obviously not okay and your boyfriend should know better.

That whole thing where he made you ""look up"" what that phrase meant shows he's clinging at straws to prove his point. He knows he's wrong. He knows he's inconsiderate.

I know old habits die hard, but it's possible to train a dog to not sleep on the bed. look, I assume the dog can probably sleep most the day if it so pleases, but you, a person with a schedule, work/school and all the stuff a human has to do, needs that nightly sleep. If the dog is disturbing you at night, then something needs to be done. Sleep is extremely important. Talk to your bf again, he definitely needs to be more considerate here! Buying a nice, comfy dog bed is definitely a good compromise. Unless the dog is loud at night, you could even have her bed near yours, so she won't be too unsettled that her two beloved humans aren't there. Or put it in her favorite hang out place if she has one. However you do it, I'm sure there's a solution that will make everyone happy."

The first is that if it's clear that the other person doesn't want to talk to you, you don't bother them. The second is that when you talk to them, be polite - don't start up with criticizing their workout. Give advice, be friendly, but don't start with critiquing them as that's something you want to make sure they want. Finally, if the person says that they don't want to talk to you, don't take it personally and don't be an asshole about it. I think you handled this fine. You'd made it fairly clear that you weren't in the mood to talk from the get-go. OP, I'm guessing that you're probably female and that this was his way of trying to hit on you and at the very least, when you weren't going to roll over and let him do whatever he wanted conversation-wise, he went all ""nice guy"" on you. Some people seem to think that women owe them conversation. "

What are you doing quitting? You've got one more rep to go!"") Regardless of how he was going about it, it wasn't his place.

There are plenty of good names from anime. Edward (Full Metal Alchemist) , Roy (Full Metal Alchemist), Alexander (Fate Zero), Eren (Attack on Titan), or even Ace (One Piece).

The fact that shes crying to you parents about sides shows she's not just a racist bigot, but a childish racist bigot. Blood is not a good reason to force a relationship with an awful person, either.

If it simply comes down to libido or something you might just not be compatible. The lingerie thing then going cold is a bit weird and understandably frustrating.

I'm assuming she's staying for free at his place which is already saving thousands of dollars if you guys stay a couple weeks! It's weird to assume you'd pay 1/2 her trip.

I do think it might be a little harsh to blame him for your issues with alcohol if he isn’t directly encouraging you to drink, but instead you are drinking because you feel depressed.

Recently, I had a friend of mine get her first bf, she has now cut contact with all male friends of hers because she is terrified of harming her new relationship. It's completely irrational, but normal for first relationships, and I think this may be along the lines of what's happening here. As for the bet, I have no idea what's up with that...but it would at least explain the sudden ""you'll need your own ride"" thing.

Of course, that goes for her, too; if she has just been trying to make you jealous, she should've expressed her feelings to you a long time ago, rather than use another person to get to you. If that wasn't the case, she was still rather tastelessly flaunting her relationship."

She’s an asshole for assuming that was only a conversation that could only be had by non-black people, and that going to Hebrew school made her some gatekeeper that conversation. If you were just complimenting nazis at random, you’d deserve a consequence but not a physical one. But in the context of the conversation you were having, you said something that made sense. If all you say is true, she’s the asshole not you. Stop hating yourself, but do avoid buying people who hit you drinks in the future. "

You kind of gloss over your conversation with her but it seems it went from ""I miss you"" to ""No I have a gf now and we're great"". Like it's true, yes, but damn it's cold man. You could have given it some more time or let her press you a bit more. But she just wanted to talk about her feelings. You decided to jump to a conclusion for her, that she can't have you anymore and thus she should get over it. Now instead of going through the natural progression of emotions following a breakup she's forced to accept this new reality and she's a bit angry about it. NTA for moving on, but you did cause your own problem here."
5,akt1v4,t2_2z8ge5rx,CatWanderlust,"YTA with exceptions. If you wanted to spare her hurt feelings you would’ve waiting until all ties were broken for a while or she had felt ready to move on. I can understand that you probably felt ready to move on for some time, and that’s why it was easy for you to move in so quickly. However, this is still all fresh for her, and she needed time to recover. You shouldn’t put your future on hold for an ex, but if you didn’t want to hurt her you should’ve cut things off totally or given her more time. I don’t believe I read the last paragraph, so this part is an edit. Her behavior is totally unacceptable. You could’ve avoided hurting her more than need-be, especially to avoid drama... be either way you’re single and she needs to be more mature about this. "
5,9u531o,t2_15lnqrz2,Stinkycheese8001,"Yep. YTA. He was interested in you, and you just wanted a secret hookup to get you off occasionally, and you tried to pressure him into intercourse while knowing that he didn’t want to go there. You didn’t treat him like a person with feelings. But you also feel bad and realize that you did him wrong. People do stupid shit in their first relationships, and despite the fact that you feel like 23 is comparatively ancient, it is most assuredly not. However, you really need to take a look at yourself for trying to pressure him into sex. That is bad, flat out."
5,a2gry0,t2_13a96t,RealHausFrau,"NTA -not at all! It’s totally inappropriate to be nude in front of children of the opposite sex who are not yours! Plus one boy was 12? Ummm, right when puberty hits?! I would be LIVID as s parent if I found out my sitter was behaving this way in front of my children. "
5,a2gry0,t2_wq5w9,DMVbandz,NTA that’s fuckin weird. I’d let the parents know. Dude when I was 12 I was humping anything with a pulse she definitely knows that kids that age are horny as shit or she’s brain damaged 
5,aknzun,t2_2z8ge5rx,CatWanderlust,"YTA. You knew she was interested. If it was nothing more than a one or two night fling for you, you shouldn’t have done it. If you actually like this guy you should’ve talked with her first. She confided this in you and you slept with him. Kind of shitty and I’d be pretty upset if I were her. She might get over it, but you should make sure you’re the one to tell her. "
5,aknzun,t2_19ddk75z,SimplyJubilant,"YTA. Not because of ""girl code"", it has nothing to do with gender. Does your friend have a ""claim"" on this guy? Absolutely not. But you did something with no regard for her feelings and something that you know will hurt her when she finds out. So you were being a bad friend. I'd recommend sitting her down and telling her in person soon if you want any shot of salvaging the friendship. You don't owe her an apology for having sex with a guy she liked, but I think you may owe her an apology for prioritizing sex over her feelings. "
5,aknzun,t2_6ppl4,bradderz958,"YTA. Even if he is not interested in L, you should respect her feelings towards J. I think you need to be the one that tells her, if it comes from someone else it could appear that you've done it to spite her - even though from what you've wrote here, I don't think you did."
5,aknzun,t2_122th8qz,xTheatreTechie,"NTA, lotta people here saying YTA, he doesn't want your mutual friend. That's apparently clear to everyone. She doesn't have a claim to him and as for ""respecting her feelings"" eh, was she supposed to respect yours when/if she banged him? That's my take. Though I've beginning to notice that I usually go against the crowd on these posts. So maybe take my judgement with a grain of salt."
5,aknzun,t2_15hmlf,Jajaninetynine,"YTA but not for sleeping with the guy, rather for thinking that your friend has any form of ownership over another person like that. Multiple people can like one person. The guy wanted you, you liked him, that's that. You cannot call dibs on someone. People who call dibs like this are vial. (Although from reading your post again, perhaps this attitude is coming from your friend and not you, in which case, your friend is TA)"
5,aknzun,t2_1byh5xq4,NomNom83WasTaken,"YTA. You knew all the circumstances and you made your choice. J, too, FWIW. How \*much\* of an asshole you are depends on a few things, like how much you cared about either of these people before you knew L was interested in J and whether he's worth losing a friendship with L."
5,anxzqd,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"NTA. But as a 15 year old, you may have to tough it out. Some unethical life tips to get out of it: if you're watching a movie, talk through it. Playing a game? Cheat. Poorly. Be as annoying as possible so they'll stop asking you to come down. Trip to the store? You need EVERYTHING. I went through a similar situation with my mom. She likes to get drunk and complain to adult me that ""You never let me hug you! You're never affectionate!!!"" Well, ma, you only like to hug when you're drunk and i want nothing to do with that. :') Good luck, kiddo. "
5,anxzqd,t2_y7ae3,Mr-Dr-Prof-Dankweed,"YTA But I understand where you're coming from. Your family loves you! They want to spend time with you! They enjoy doing things more if you're around, even something as insignificant as watching TV. Your sister sounds very sweet and affectionate. That can irritating, but try to be more sympathetic! She's saying she loves you, and it's not kind of you to respond by being uncomfortable. Talk to her about other ways she can show her affection."
5,a3xjah,t2_kxwo3,heidiramone,"NTA. You're a kid and you need to be a kid. You're probably too young to really understand her feelings anyways, so I don't understand why she doesn't just talk to a friend instead of you. Also, a parent should NEVER tell their kid that they're *considering* divorcing the other parent. That's way too much to unload on your child."
5,axqvgx,t2_2l5ykjsn,Suomynona0000,"YTA...but just a teensy bit. It’s a public microwave, so it would be nice to clean it after you use it (if it was just yours, who cares) especially since you realized that you left behind a mess (in this case a strong smell)"
5,b582yh,t2_xseu9,AileySue,"NTA for being mad, what she did was childish and you should have talked to her about it. She can’t be spending money you don’t have on things you don’t need she needs to grow up. YTA for going off as badly as you did on her and just assuming she will do it again. "
5,b582yh,t2_p6t6gzq,fearmyminivan,"NTA but y’all need to work out a budget. When I was married, the man I was married to and I each had spending money built into our budget. That way if I came home with shoes or he came home with a video game we wouldn’t accuse the other of spending outside of our means. Work out how much money you guys can spend a month on going out, buying extras for the house, etc. Then the hard part: stick to it. This means sometimes missing out when other people are doing fun things. This means waiting to get things you want. This means having a level head and not being impulsive. It’s hard but it’s SO worth it. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_njd5a,princeslayer,"YTA Not for rejecting her, but for how you handled it. There's a myriad of ways you could have cut it off, but going with ""You're handicapped, it's not going to work, bye"" was pretty callous."
5,aw7rpq,t2_21asixxi,BeefBot9000,"After reading your replies to comments here, I'm convinced you are an asshole in general. That probably is why things didn't go well despite the fact you're technically NTA for rejecting someone for any reason. I'm gonna guess this will be a common pattern for your life lol"
5,aw7rpq,t2_1n7g6pln,DubiousDutchy,"YTA, not because a wheelchair is an obstacle you can't overcome, but because you lack empathy in expressing yourself. Be blunt with your close friends, be sensitive with those that do not know you so well. I'm Dutch and even Dutch people think I am blunt in private, which is saying something. I tend to think of it as not selling bs, but being clear, concise and truthful. Still, you could have figured out that it wouldn't work from the start and still treat her well and get to know her, you only saw the wheelchair, not an actual person, so... YTA, don't treat people like dick recepticles even if you are a dick yourself. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_eqkb6,deepfield67,"Damn. I think *I'm* about to cry, too. This hurt to read. YTA and you owe that girl an appology. You can't help not being attracted to someone for whatever reason, though I don't think I understand the reason... But you handled it poorly. I do think your friend should have told you because I would feel taken aback by it if it were me and I would resent the implication that I might not want to meet her if I knew she was in a wheelchair, and by not telling you the poor girl was set up to get hurt. Just out of curiosity, why are you opposed to being with someone in a wheelchair?"
5,aw7rpq,t2_qjtilm0,JustAnArtist01,"ESH with more YTA for how you handled it. Don’t make someone feel they aren’t dateable for a disability or being in a wheelchair. You can just say “I’m sorry, but I don’t feel a connection” and say something nice about the time spent with them anyway. Don’t say “I don’t like you because you are in a wheelchair” type of thing. Your friend could’ve told you, but I understand why the girl you went on didn’t want that info to be told. She doesn’t want to be seen as the girl in a wheelchair. This is probably not the first time she was made to feel inadequate to date because of it. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_pbcjc,buell_ersdayoff,"NTA. What is he supposed to do people? Fucking lie? Give her some bullshit about how there's no connection or how he's not interested? Come on man. What is this shit? High School? If the girl wasn't ready to accept him not liking her because of the wheelchair, maybe, just fucking maybe, it would've been something to be upfront about. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_y091y,LeighSabio,"YTA. You don’t owe her sex or a second date or anything like that, but you do owe her tact and basic politeness. You could have just completed the date and then told her you didn’t think a relationship would work out and would rather just be friends. You didn’t have to bring the disability into it, because no is a complete sentence. “No because you’re disabled” is needlessly cruel."
5,aw7rpq,t2_zmjh74j,Bangbangsmashsmash,"YTA, you acted like a dick! Did anyone ever teach you tact?!? You could have been more polite as opposed to possibly giving this girl mental scars! Your friend is never going to hook you up with anyone again, and I bet word will get around too"
5,aw7rpq,t2_cr75r,IAmInside,"You're not an asshole for rejecting someone for being a certain way, everyone is free to have whichever preferences they want, but **YTA** since you handled the situation so poorly. Being rejected because of illness, especially permanent illness, really fucking hurts. It's something you're far too often worried about. Honestly, this is a situation where a white lie to save her feelings would've been the best choice. So yeah, this is one of those rare circumstances where you are the asshole because you didn't lie. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_1xtd9gx2,Cent1234,"YTA strictly for how you handled it. If you're not interested in people in wheelchairs, fine. Don't throw it in their faces. The whole point of a first date, let alone a blind date, is to figure this stuff out. You figured it out. So get through the date, then simply let her know that you're not interested in another. Done."
5,aw7rpq,t2_2wj9a87x,littleheaterlulu,"YTA, I will say it again, and yes you are shallow. My inbox has lit up with so many stupid assholes saying it's not shallow but it is because you weren't meeting her to have sex, you weren't meeting her to have an arranged marriage, you weren't meeting her to even form a friendship necessarily, you were meeting her to have a cup of coffee. You should be able to politely drink a cup of coffee with someone in a wheelchair. It is freaking shallow that you cannot. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_39pqu1aj,Elysium03086,NTA You were put in a pretty awkward position. People may not agree with your wording but that's neither here nor there. You have the right to refuse dating anyone for any reason. I personally feel that you are not even obligated to give a reason. What would definitely make you the asshole is leading her on knowing that you weren't interested. Rejection stings no matter what; but it's way worse when you have been led to believe this person liked you. 
5,aw7rpq,t2_2c2q3ly2,a_flying_stegosaurus,"I’m going NTA here. Could OP have handled this better? Yes. But I think its unfair to say someone is an asshole for not properly dealing with a situation that wasn’t their fault at all. The girl in the wheelchair intentionally manipulated OP by not saying shes in a wheelchair, and its her responsibility to get that out of the way before the first date. I think OP tried to be friends at first and had good intentions but she wanted to date and he didn’t; an ugly end had to come from this situation no matter what."
5,aw7rpq,t2_784jz,Bashfluff,"NTA. This woman manipulated you. Both her and her friend had to know that this would be a deal-breaker for people. That's why she hid it. What, are you supposed to be her shoulder to cry on after you call her out (not even in a mean way, but in an honest way) for that? Are you supposed to reward what she did by still going on that date with her? No, I don't think so. If I were still dating, I would have told her straight. ""You hid this from me and that's not cool. You had an idea that this would be a deal-breaker for me, but you hid it from me to get a date, and you need to learn how to treat people better."" If that hurt her feelings, yeah, that sucks, but it's also not my responsibility to date her and to try to cheer her up after she tried to lead me on like that, and I definitely wouldn't feel guilty for leaving before the date is over."
5,aw7rpq,t2_6suvr,Zenopus,"NTA. They lied. While this girl may have been sweet and funny, it does not change her apperance. If you don't like it, then you don't like it. That is not for someone else to dictate. You were thrown into a shitty situation, with no preperation. Could have been more gentle, but she is an adult woman who got rejected. The fact she is in a wheelchair should not matter. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_32g79of7,donotresusciate,"YTA. Did you tell her your entire medical history before you met her? Or a huge trauma from your life? An abusive parent? A big dark thing that has shaped much of who you are as a person? No, of course you didn’t. She doesn’t have to tell you she’s in a wheelchair. The fact that a wheelchair is an instant dealbreaker for you makes you a massive asshole. Then how you handled it, makes your arsehole bigger than the wheel on her chair. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_14xww8j1,Band1c0t,"YTA and very impolite, not because you reject her, but the way you talk to her at the end. If you don't like her, just part away, you dont need to tell her that is not going to work and insulting stuffs, the way you did is very social inappropriate, dunno if your parents teach you how to be nice to people. She must be hurt and hate her life, specially with your comment."
5,aw7rpq,t2_5i4enaj,Barbarichealer,"YTA. Not for not moving forward with her. But, cutting the date short, is kind of a dickish move. Even if you didn't see her that way, which can happen with any girl, enjoy the time that your together as friends for the night, even if u know its not going anywhere. Your friend is an ass for not mentioning it beforehand though. You could have been cooler about the whole thing, overall. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_lxaqml,Chill-BL,"NTA, Short while ago, some lady married some dude. She didn't knew the guy had a micro dick, and the guy refused the fuck, because of this. first he wanted to get married before doing it. (like it would solve something) After marrying and finally initiating, she found out. She handled it shitty, but she was lied to, as were you. so in my opinion NTA. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_39so8cww,Remarkable_Answer,"YTA. She and your friend not telling you was a dick move, agreed. But think about how her life generally is, being rejected without people even knowing her. She wanted to see if she could be liked for who she was. Again, dick move but understandable. You not wanting to be with her is also very understandable, you are not forced to overlook her disability and people are dicks if they expect you to. But you handled it all wrong. Should have been way nicer with her. I don't know if you're looking for advice, but I think you should apologize, not for not wanting her, but for being mean. I don't think you're a bad person, you were just in a situation you didn't know how to properly handle, and that's ok. Apologize, learn from it, and move on"
5,aw7rpq,t2_1ckethps,Transit-Strike,"YTA. The only reason you ditched her is because she was in a wheelchair. From what I understand, you genuinely liked texting her. But ""rejected"" her cause she was in a wheelchair. This isn't a case of ""she wasn't someone I was into. So I didn't want to date her. I feel guilty cause she's in a wheelchair"" This is a case of ""I dumped her solely cause she is in a wheelchair"""
5,aw7rpq,t2_6rp99,thechrissie,"NTA What a shitty position to be in. Either you lie (and leave her questioning why you didn't want to date), or you tell the truth (which makes her feel bad anyway). You were put in that position by this girl and your friend and had no way of coming out ahead. They set you up to fail. Also, I have a lot of sympathy for this girl, but when it comes to paraplegia, partners are signing up for a whole lot more than just ""they can't walk good."" There's a whole host of conditions of dating a paraplegic. And honestly, shame on her for trying to guilt trip you into something you weren't prepared for. It's uncool. Could you have been nicer? Sure. But you know who else could have been less shitty? Your friend and Sarah. NTA due to forces beyond your control. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_m01zh,theoriginalj,"NTA. Surprised by all the people that think what she did was ok. She had plenty of chances before you met to send a full body pic or just tell you. It sounds like you did your best to be tactful but she brought her rejection on herself. I'd have been pissed off if I were you, and feel like I'd been baited. And if she'd just told you before hand you might have gone out with her anyway. Nobody likes to be misled."
5,aw7rpq,t2_3a6a0fra,Musashi10000,"YTA As a few people have stated, it's entirely valid not wanting to get into a relationship with someone with health issues, even if those health issues only extend to mobility. You have to assess your own needs and capacities, balance them against the other person's, and determine how much you're capable of giving. She's definitely in the wrong for not mentioning it to you beforehand, but I can understand why someone would want to get to know-how before revealing something like that. What I'd have done in her position is gotten to know you, secured the date, THEN told you, so it wouldn't be a surprise. YTA basically because of how you handled it. I would have at least finished the date. You took off, mid-date, having told someone that you wouldn't be with them because of the wheelchair. Tact is a thing, and I'd recommend you learn some. If you hadn't bolted, then she'd be the asshole. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_6lzgi,Beeb294,"ESH. She should have been upfront. Somewhat understandable knowing that people are judgmental fucks, but she still should have been upfront. She and your friend are TA for that. That said, if she was a nice girl, you hit it off well enough over text, and you thought she was cute. To cut it off over that without any warning, especially considering you only talked for 48ish hours before meeting her, makes you TA. It's not like this was hidden for months or anything. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_hcokh,limpingpigeon,"YTA because ending a first date with an outright rejection _in public_ is almost always a jerk move. Even if the person is not very invested, rejection never feels good and it can feel embarrassing if it's done in public. If a first date is a dud, but you don't want to be a jerk, you say something like ""it was nice to meet you, but I have to get going"". Then later you text and say you don't think this will work out but wish them well in the future so they can be sad about it without an audience. You got annoyed and you were blunt about ending the date. That's your right, but sometimes being bluntly honest still makes you the asshole. And while I agree that actively concealing something that will be obvious upon meeting isn't a good strategy, it's a _first_ date. First dates are low-stakes, low-commitment, and almost always a wild card. I feel like it's probably unrealistic to have much expectation of people disclosing potential dealbreakers before meeting for coffee. Most people aren't going to offer up a list of reasons not to date them."
5,aw7rpq,t2_16fctm,xAlois,"NTA. &#x200B; It's not easy saying this, but I stand behind this judgement. I don't like the way you acted in this situation, and perhaps I wouldn't even personally like you, OP, but, in all fairness, you were thrown in an awkward situation by your friend. You were effectively mislead and lied to up until the date itself happened, and, expectedly, you handled things poorly. You could've had tact, but being tactful is a matter of capability rather than intentions - usually, at least. I feel more sorrow for your date. Yes, she and your friend lied to you, but I doubt you took a moment to think about why she'd need to lie about stuff like this in the first place. It ain't easy, and she's just as much deserving of love as you are. I think you're shallow, but reasonably so. You've a right to your own standards. Maybe give the suffering you've caused to the poor girl some thought."
5,aw7rpq,t2_1e2krssr,bigrottentuna,"YTA. You couldn’t even be polite to the poor girl for an hour or two. She is not obligated to tell you her life story before you show up for a coffee date. If you don’t want a second date, that’s fine, but there was no reason to treat her so callously. Some day, if you are lucky, you may meet someone who will overlook your emotional handicap."
5,aw7rpq,t2_27waref5,AdrianaGaming,"YTA 100%, imo. Yeah, it's a bad reason to reject her, but there's mainly that you rejected her in such a rude way and seem to have ignored her very understand reasoning for why she didn't tell you. She may be sensitive about it overall, too. Basically, the way you behaved sounds way out of line and insensitive. Rejecting her for that would be fine, I suppose, if you truly lost most or all interest, but doing it like this? Come on, man. I hope you never behave like this again. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_33w8juh1,whiskywineandcats,"YTA. For the way you rejected her, for not accepting the judgment of YTA. And for all your justification comments to everyone saying you’re an asshole How would we bang? Seriously? Such an asshole. She didn’t realise it at the time but she dodged a bullet. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_17by7l,Terror-Error,YTA. How could you not be? Yes they were pulling the wool over your eyes but you couldn't have handled it worse. You had no reason to just run out! You were incredibly inconsiderate but I'm certain others will enjoy this vent opportunity more than I. 
5,aw7rpq,t2_wfbqi,NebulaSlayer,"YTA. Yeah, it caught you off guard, but would have cost you anything to be a decent human being? Talk, even if you’re not interested, and be polite and respectful of her feelings. Imagine if you were plainly told “this isn’t gonna work out because you have freckles and it’s disgusting” (shitty example but anyway) wouldn’t feel good, would it? Like you could have just been nice, and then later told her you weren’t interested in A NICE WAY. God, just from your replies it’s clear you lack empathy completely. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_1w674w47,eyeball-beesting,"YTA. Ok, so it turned out you are too shallow to see past the chair like she had hoped, that is fine- everyone has their preferences. But the way you 'noped' it out of there because she was a wheelchair user was pretty shitty. You had been talking to her and seemed to have got on really well. She is still that person and you could have had a pleasant chat and coffee with her, as you are leaving tell her that she is lovely but you don't see a relationship with her. What you did was all kinds of shitty. EDIT - spelling"
5,aw7rpq,t2_hguhx,RiotGrrr1,YTA for shitting on her like that on the date. You could have finished the conversation/date naturally and just said you weren’t interest romantically. What makes you think you handled that correctly??? 
5,aw7rpq,t2_rcmj1,Gouranga56,YTA...look. I get you were not into that. You could have been a lot more sensitive. That was harsh. Yeah she tricked ya a bit on the blind date part but you crushed her.
5,aw7rpq,t2_6u2o6,Jayrodtremonki,"YTA Not for not wanting to take things further, but for making a big deal out of it and ending things on the spot. I mean, if she was missing a hand would you have told her ""eww, gross. No thanks""? Or would you have done something with the slightest bit of tact if that was a deal breaker? And would you expect a picture of her hand before the date as full disclosure? It's not like she tricked you into marrying her or something. It was a date. You found out pretty quickly. Get over yourself. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_emcns,Odeon42,"NTA - That was a lie by omission. Not a way to start a relationship. Any relationship, even if it's just friends. You were honest with her, while she was not honest with you. You're good here."
5,aw7rpq,t2_16cxlp,sloth_hug,"NTA, but your responses to these comments point to you being an asshole in general. She was purposely deceptive and her crying about it when you called her out doesn't make you an asshole. Sorry, tears don't mean someone has to date you. But quit arguing with people as that's not what the sub is for."
5,aw7rpq,t2_1btjiaov,Forzara,"ESH. You handled it poorly, and you can’t just spring handicaps on people. I mean, ffs, if your favorite thing in the world is hiking up mountains - I mean, come on. But you’re for sure an asshole if you just stormed out. Best way would’ve been to finish the date, and politely message saying, “Hey, it was nice talking to you. I had fun. I think you’re nice but didn’t feel any chemistry.” "
5,aw7rpq,t2_11y9dx,Burner31805,"NTA, I'm honestly blown away by the sheer number of people in this thread that seem to think the idea that a person wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone in a wheelchair makes you some kind of horrible person. OP, maybe next time be a little bit nicer about it, but please don't listen to all the self righteous people in this thread. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_2t0aoi2h,et-regina,"ESH but especially you OP. Yes this girl should really have disclosed that she was in a wheelchair beforehand, primarily for her own sake in case you turned out to be a dick about it (spoiler alert: you totally were) but also to give you a chance to process this information privately before you met her, as I imagine it was a bit of a shock and that might have negatively affected your reaction. That said: ""I think you're pretty and I've enjoyed talking to you but I don't want to date you because you're in a wheelchair"" - of course YTA, how is it even a question. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_oa0du,anime_lover713,"ESH - YTA for how you handled it, she's the TA for in a way lying to you about her disability. Cute or whatever, if you're not alright with dating wheelchair girls then that's your choice. Cuteness doesn't always change that. You did handle it poorly though. "
5,aw7rpq,t2_2wdkylaq,damagedtrash,NTA As someone whose disabled and has been in a wheelchair and had a solid relationship through it I know that having a relationship with someone with any kind of disability can be taxing. If it’s not something you think you can handle then don’t even start the relationship. OP I think you definitely made the right choice. If it’s not the kind of relationship you want you shouldn’t start it. 
5,aw7rpq,t2_1k6cm1xm,lyra_silver,"NTA I agree you didn't have tact with how you handled it, but she actively hid a HUGE part of her from you. Not wanting to go into a relationship with a disabled person isn't bad. Not everyone can deal with something like that. It's not like you're dumping a current SO because they ended up in a wheelchair, THAT would be asshole behavior. She should never have hid something like that for you and shouldn't be surprised by your reaction. She kinda deserves it, lie by omission. "
5,9zndzt,t2_2evg93er,InquisitorCelestino,"YTA beyond a doubt. To break it down: 1. You said that he IS attempting to lose wait, but it is slow going because of his schedule among other things. The guy is trying to change, and most likely it's for your sake. You really can't ask for much more than that, it's not easy to lose weight while trying to deal with life. 2. Using his weight as an insult in multiple arguments is a HARD YTA. It's destructive, it REALLY hurts, and you all you are doing is belittling him to no good end. 3. You Think your friends would be ashamed of him? That means you, whether or not you admit it, are ashamed of him to an extent. And that is not justified here. From everything you've said, he seems to be as loyal, devoted, and caring a bf as anyone could ask for. If his weight means more to you and your friends than his actions, then you need to look yourself in the mirror and think about who is the better person in this relationship."
5,9zndzt,t2_16020v,Nyhtt,"YTA, You clearly are not fine with his weight if you are too ashamed of it to bring him around your friends, so stop saying you are fine with it. Bringing up sensitive subjects just to try and hurt the other person in a argument is an asshole thing to do, it shouldn't be you vs him you should work together to solve the problem. If you really loved him it wouldn't matter what your friends think of him. I know when I'm out with my GF I don't care what anyone but her thinks of me. I'll make my self look like the biggest fool in the world just to put a small smile on her face. "
5,9zndzt,t2_f3scg,Bob_Toot,"YTA You want him to conform to a standard that you think your friends will find acceptable, because you're worried about how they'll judge YOU, not how they'll judge HIM. You even said so yourself. If he's okay with how he looks, and you're okay with it, it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. And they aren't really your friends if they are going to judge YOU on how HE looks. And there's nothing wrong with encouraging him to lose weight. You could even go to the gym with him and be motivational. But turning it into a weapon in an argument, knowing it'll make him feel bad and concede the argument to you, that's just plain disgusting and manipulative and he doesn't deserve it, nor do you deserve him. It kind of comes across like you are more in love with the way he makes you feel rather than actually being in love with him."
5,9zndzt,t2_mtnsbp8,BonnJord,"Pointing out his weight in arguments shows that to you, his weight is an embarrassment so you’re not fine with his weight. You don’t want him around your friends because of how you deceive him! YdefinitelyTA."
5,9zndzt,t2_avj2eic,jr061898,"YTA. If you really love him, why do you actively try to avoid your friends of seeing him?. Honestly, that doesn't looks like love to me. Like, I get that you don't to be judged. But that attitude doesn't seems too healthy in a relationship. Even more so, are you so sure that your friends are going to judge for that?. That he is trying as best as he can to be more fit and healthy for you, but it doesn't looks like you are at least making the effort to not be ashamed of being seeing with him. I'm honestly surprised that he is acting so fine about this. If I were in his place I would feel horrible."
5,9zndzt,t2_16gu49,acrylicvigilante_,"YTA. Although every partner we're with has flaws we might not love, not being able to bring that person around our friends because we're embarrassed is a huge sign they're not for us. Also... > My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained. You say all the things your boyfriend does, but never mention the reasons you like him that aren't tasks to better your life. He's not a tv show, he's not meant to keep you entertained. Why do you love him for *him*? For example, I love my boyfriend because he's witty, genuinely kind to everyone, thoughtful, stubborn, and wakes up every day intending to make that day the best. Too often men are valued only because of what they can do, not what they are, and I think that might be what's happening here."
5,9zndzt,t2_14ro68,moongirl12,"YTA. If you love someone, you aren't ashamed of them. He's happy with himself and you continually belittle him for his weight. If you don't change I won't be surprised if you end up single."
5,9zndzt,t2_t3g4h,MtGMagicBawks,"YTA >I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. This is not ""I'm fine with his weight and the way he looks"". You're clearly not fine with it. And throwing it at him as an insult is a real shit move."
5,as3m0x,t2_mk10f,yourfaveace,"YTA. Listen I know people are allergic to talking about their boundaries and levels of comfort with their partners, but I do a thing with my SO that works pretty well: we defined from the beginning situations in which we'd be okay seeing each other engaging with someone else. We're both okay with kissing other people as long as we tell each other but that's it - ergo, we'd know exactly how to proceed in a game like truth or dare. You're not the asshole because you didn't see harm in kissing your friend - you're an asshole because you didn't bother to question your boyfriend's level of comfort with that situation, you simply presumed it would be the same as yours. "
5,as3m0x,t2_14ln1t,cigsafter,"YTA. You probably shouldn't have done it, but your bf also didn't seem against it if all he did was smirk and shrug like you said. I get where he's coming from by not objecting publicly, as that could make him feel some type of way. I think he should've been more clear, but I also think you should've just turned down the dare. I know I'd be pissed if my bf thought it would be okay to kiss another girl because a game told him to."
5,as3m0x,t2_1lhlipy,mixed_breed101,"YTA, for trying to use alcohol as an excuse, and for cheating on your boyfriend in front of him. It doesn’t matter that it was a good friend, you still kissed another guy, all for a dare? You clearly don’t respect the relationship as much as your boyfriend. Getting another girl’s number is completely different from straight up kissing a member of the opposite sex, and I think you know that. I’m pretty sure you’re trying to rationalize what you did by including his dare to get another girl’s number, which makes you an even bigger asshole. "
5,atb3bw,t2_1vyx8226,silver_stature,"YTA. You could have phrased it better, even if it is the truth. If you’ve lived with her for the better part of a decade, I’m sure she’s feeling a ton of guilt and sadness that maybe she’s not enough or she’s done something to push you away. "
5,atb3bw,t2_ohv69,Dr_thri11,"YTA, if your mom isn't abusive or just an all around bad person, its wrong to express to her that you love (even if you said like your mom probably interpreted it as love) your dad more. You're old enough that you should probably get some say in your own living situation and theres nothing wrong with you wanting to live at your dad's during the week. "
5,a1v1ph,t2_1qbgxh4c,Palerthanghosts,"NTA. That is really weird. From what I remember, though, Chad and Taylor don't kiss in HSM so it could've been worse...... At least the directors are willing to work with you and you're willing to take on a smaller role."
5,aorwnz,t2_y5kn5,KyutiePie,"YTA. Not for not wanting your FIL there, but for sort of demanding that he can’t be in the room. For most hospitals, the mother’s decision of who gets to be in the room and who doesn’t is final. You can tell her that he won’t be there all you want but ultimately if she decides she wants him there, that’s what going to happen. Your wife is an adult and will be going through the pain of labour to give life to your child, if having her dad there makes her comfortable then let him be there. "
5,aorwnz,t2_1aw99oim,lilyandcarlos,"NTA IT is also your child. Tell your wife, that This is a very special moment for you, and you are afraid, that her fathers bring there Will destroy IT for you. Fathers have rights too. I have given birth to 2 kids, and only had my husbond with me. "
5,aorwnz,t2_16k1v8,NMPire,"NTA. It's your child together and it should be an intimate moment for both of you. If you were both fine with them being there, then whatever, but since you both aren't (and even more so since he doesn't like you) it's valid for you to not want him to be there."
5,b32ymu,t2_9u2dl,VortexMagus,"YTA It sucks that you had that kind of drama, or that you feel like she betrayed you by siding with your ex, but this is pretty normal in nasty, public breakups. Some people will take your side, some people won't, for a variety of reasons. You just gotta deal with it. On the other hand, I think we're all pretty clear that the only reason you told her parents about her relationship was to hurt her, and no other reason. In this case, YTA."
5,b32ymu,t2_27wbnxwa,hashtagimanerd,"YTA She might be too, but if she was friends with him first, your breakup may have put her in an awkward spot. So I’d say not enough info on her. But you for sure are an asshole for the fact that you did it as “revenge”. Breakups suck. And losing friends over it double sucks. But that shit happens frequently. Your intentions here were to be a dick. "
5,b32ymu,t2_35937dzv,jenski1987,YTA. You are definitely TA here but dont let it get to you too much. You are young and highschool can be tough AF. You may lose this friend but consider it a lesson learnt. I would try to stay out of others business from now on. Im sorry your friends took sides on you that sucks.
5,ak0zkc,t2_5o2dx,TheLadyEve,"YTA, that's what a tip is for. If I had been on a date and the guy did that...yeah, I wouldn't call him an asshole but I would be seriously dubious about that guy. You temporarily stressed out your server and then took up the manager's time just so you could give her a compliment....when you could have just said ""thank you for the great service"" and left a generous tip. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_urb8pnp,BigDisaster,"YTA here, totally. I've worked in customer service for over 15 years and the whole ""let the server/clerk/cashier think they're in trouble until SURPRISE...they're actually not!"" act is never, ever fun. When you freak us out like that it can take a while for the stress to go away--stress hormones don't just vanish the moment we realize everything's okay. You can absolutely sour the rest of our work shift, which is a shitty thing to do to someone you're supposedly hoping to compliment. The next time you want to do something nice for someone else, try to think more about what would actually be nice for *them*."
5,ak0zkc,t2_j3k54fn,drunkirishfeminist,"YTA - surely this had to be another dumb validation seeking post but then I read it and no you actually managed to be the asshole in this situation! What a truly arrogant and condescending way to behave, I’m glad your date saw through it. Also the reaction you saw from the waitress wasn’t gratitude it was relief you weren’t fucking her over, she would have been grateful for a bigger tip."
5,ak0zkc,t2_amcm0,squary93,"YTA there are good ways to compliment the staff and bad ways. You chose the bad way. And not only that, your date probably took it like ""Why is he paying more attention to the waitress than me?"" And maybe she isn't as good as a listener as you believe and she gets annoyed by you continuing to talk instead of asking her stuff. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_pxerk,Ralphie99,"YTA I assume you wrote this trying to portray yourself in the best light possible. However you still come off as a pompous ass. You made the waitress think that she had done something wrong and made both her and your date feel awkward by not telling the waitress why you wanted to see the manager, despite her asking for a reason. Instead you repeated your request without providing any other info to put her mind at ease. Your date must have been very uncomfortable during this whole interaction. And then, plot twist! You actually wanted to talk to the managed to compliment the waitress! See? You’re a great guy after all! Who wouldn’t want to be your girlfriend? You put on a show for your date and it backfired because you came off haughty and superior. Next time try to act like a normal human being when out on a date rather than putting on a big production to try to impress her."
5,ak0zkc,t2_2oxw45vo,nepsola,"YTA on this one OP. Ughhh, blurgh! You basically sound like you were on some kind of weird power trip. It's the way you did it. Not telling the waitress why you wanted to speak to her manager, making a big show of it. All you had to do was leave a nice tip, thank HER for her great service, or if you really had to go and speak to her manager, you could have simply excused yourself as if you were going to the bathroom, then told the waitress herself that you'd like to tell her manager she did a really good job. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_28dojdf0,101kbye,"YTA- it’s like you were playing some weird psychological game where you make someone feel bad at first and then surprise them with something positive. Huge red flag. My dad is a narcissist and does this all the time. For example, he’ll tell a 7 yr old (my niece) he didn’t get them a birthday present and you can see the glee on his face as he watches the child’s face fall. Then it’s “just kidding! Here you go!” while snickering. It’s not funny, it’s cruel, and why would you want to inflict any psychological pain on someone like that? This reeks of “it’s just a prank, bro!” She’d be smart to not date you again. Also, who asks “be my girlfriend” on the third date? "
5,ak0zkc,t2_ridn7,Stinkehund1,"YTA. You could've said something like ""I'd like to compliment you on your service and let your manager know what a good job you did"", but even that would still be sorta douchey. The way you did it was a major asshole move. She didn't look happy because you complimented her, she looked happy because it turned out that you didn't have a complain about her after you behaved like you did. And you seem to think you did her some kind of favor with that, which makes it even worse. Your date was absolutely right; you are so full of yourself that you're spilling out the top, dude."
5,ak0zkc,t2_eriht,celephia,"YtA. No reason to terrify the poor girl. Nothing good EVER follows ""Let me speak to your manager."" Secondly, why oh why did you have to make such a big deal about how she was such a good server and you are such a good person for giving her such a nice compliment and doesn't your date see how you're just such a nice guy? Guy above said it best- what in the fedora tipping shit is this? "
5,ak0zkc,t2_2jexbi8i,Luciferbelle,"YTA The title is very misleading. You were already trying to win over the readers with it. I've been a waitress, this has happened to me. My manager even told me it was an asshole thing to do. Also, she's probably a ""good listener"" because you never let her speak. I've been on dates and told how much of a ""good listener"" I was. Mainly because the dude never shut up about himself or how much money he made during the entire date. Just leave a good tip, and get on with your life. I got left a $20 on a $30 tab. My manager recognized it as me doing a good job. Btw, try being the ""good listener"" for once, and shut the hell up."
5,ak0zkc,t2_1642om,Cassereddit,"YTA. The gesture may have been meant well, but you could've gone about this in so many ways without making the waitress think she'll be complained about For example tip her well and say that you would like to give the manager positive feedback about you so she can move up in life."
5,ak0zkc,t2_airpb,clintnorth,YTA. if you did all that on the down-low it would have been fine. but that was very showboat-y of you and there is not way it didn't cause stress for both your server and your date as well. 
5,ak0zkc,t2_dhvmby,min2themax,"Oooof. Well intentioned but YTA my dude. You clearly scared the waitress into thinking she made a mistake. And the fact that you don’t get that does not reflect well on you at all. Don’t blame this girl for thinking you were indeed, the asshole. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_139j1o,fatlittletoad,"YTA because you wouldn't tell her why. This whole story would be different, and I guarantee your date would have reacted differently if you had said, ""Thanks so much! If your manager has a minute I'd love to let him know how happy we are with your service!"" That's it. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_1q41ufbz,PicklePuffin,"Looks like you've got the idea from the responses- your account of this makes it sound like you were trying to be impressively gracious. Telling her she did a great job would be fine. Telling the manager on the way out would be fine, in most cases. The way you did it causes stress to someone in an already very stressful job. It feels artificially magnanimous. You did sound like you wanted to be impressive. Treating service workers well is an excellent thing to do. Being ostentatious about it, ruins it."
5,ak0zkc,t2_12a0y7,LiteUpThaSkye,"YTA. Someone asking for thr manager is never a good thing, and you know that. Especially with the way you just repeated it. You probably terrified the waitress that she was going to lose her job. Next time... ""I'd like to tell your manager what an excellent job you've done"" Honestly.. If I were your date.. I probably wouldn't talk to you anymore either. Had you worded it the way I suggested, completely different story and reaction. Lesson learned I hope. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_fva633u,bonio22,"YTA. i know they weren't your intentions but you scared your waitress for life and i don't know if you left the tip \[manager won't give her a tip or anything\], your date overreacted though, but it was not enough to consider esh edit: also, i don't know if you are just talking about yourself and being annoying or if she really doesn't have anything to say about herself edit2: also, next time don't try to make a show out of it, just thank your waitress and leave a good tip, it's not like manager is going to give her a raise because of that"
5,ak0zkc,t2_pf0c0o2,rebeccavt,"YTA. If this happened as you described it, you were totally acting full of yourself and I would be kind of horrified if a guy did that on a date with me. You know how you let a waitress and her manager know that she did a great job, while not looking like an asshole in front of your date? You tip her well. That’s it. That’s literally all you have to do. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_9u7th,zoeyversustheraccoon,"YTA There are a lot of better ways to compliment good service without trying to come across as Mr. Magnanimous. You undermined the sincerity of your intentions. And the subsequent comments about not tipping extra...you're digging yourself into a deeper hole. Next time, tip 20-25%, tell the waitress she was awesome, and tell the manager the same thing on the way out the door. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_m50rp,MzHarleyQuinn,"Kinda thinking YTA. My first issue is in how you describe your date. Sure, it’s been just a few, but what you seem to like about her is that she’s pretty and silent. Wanting a good listener as a partner is normal...would she get one with you? Secondly, it’s not that you complimented the waitress. Of course that is nice...but you started with some attention-seeking scare tactic that probably had this poor girl internally crying, why? Was the “A-ha, gotcha!” moment worth it? That shit only works on reality TV. And, having worked on it, reality TV is pretty much as awful and manipulative as you can imagine. I’m being as nice as I can be here, but this all reminds me of shit my dad would say and do. It’s not a good thing. He’s a selfish prick. He prefers his wives (and mistresses) Stepford-like. He’ll grandstand like this, reaching for sycophantic gold stars. I haven’t talked to him in years. It’s not like he listens, anyway. I don’t think there’s a cure for narcissistic behavior, but you may not quite gone yet. This is barely a snapshot into your life, and maybe you’re just not great at storytelling? I don’t know. Even so, check your head a bit, cause this shit is not cool. Why did you feel that it was okay to pull a “Gotcha!” on someone who had been doing such a wonderful job? Did she deserve that? EDIT: Oh no, reading more...Y are absolutely TA. Compliments are fine, but fucking pay up. At your job, do you want an atta-boy, or a raise? Fuck off with your archaic shit, and don’t dine out again until your attitude improves."
5,ak0zkc,t2_4axzx,seedypete,"YTA. And if there was any doubt it’s been more than erased by your responses here. You’re a huge asshole, you were showing off for your date without caring how anxious it would make your server for no reason. She was a prop you were using to impress your date, and your date didn’t fall for it. Good for her. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_13k1le,khaosknight69,"This is a late comment and I doubt you'll read it, but the reason everyone is saying you're an asshole is because of how you went about telling the manager your waitress did a good job. You know exactly what it was too, you make deliberate mention of it - ""I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him."" That's not how you do that if the next words out of your mouth are a compliment, that's how you do it when you have a complaint. That's why she asked if there was something wrong. On the trip between your table and her manager she was probably shitting herself wondering what she did wrong. Your tactless manner in which you chose to compliment her turned your compliment into a negative situation. &#x200B; So YTA, but it seems like you may have not intended to be. Still, I will echo the others and your date in that NEARLY ALL PEOPLE understand intrinsically what happened and why things went wrong for you here, and if you really truly don't understand what you did then you're either severely developmentally disabled, or just an asshole. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_uu8a7iv,Jb2head,"YTA, I understand your intention, but reading your comments, you “don’t believe in tipping extra.” You wanted to commend the server on her great service, but not want to pay an extra tip. That makes you come across as a jack ass. Unpopular thing to do, but I don’t leave a tip for mediocre service. If the person hardly talks or barely refills our drinks, unless we ask, I do not tip, for average service, I tip about 5-10$. But I have tipped, one waiter who was a really cool guy, 25$ before. (I’m a college student so I haven’t gone to any really expensive restaurants) When I was younger my dad would tip like 40$ or something to good waitress or waiters. There’s a certain way to do it and that ain’t it. It’s just like you show your gratitude with a tip. If you were going to call the manager over and commend your waitress for their service, I feel like it’s almost mandatory to give them a decent tip as well. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_1rt29qd9,MatrixMushroom,"NTA, you wanted to tell the manager that the waitress was doing a great job, and that's not showboating. If you had just complimented the waitress, she would have to then go and basically brag to the manager to get any recognition. Sure you could've handled it a bit better, but I'm still shocked at the amount of people saying you're the asshole."
5,ak0zkc,t2_53f5575,too-cute-by-half,"Yeah, YTA for what I'm sure you see as an ""alpha"" move. These are a bunch of red flags as well: ""This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself."" You sound as if you like women who ""know their place."" ""rare quality of being a great listener"" says to me that a lot of women have expressed annoyance at the way you dominate conversation."
5,ak0zkc,t2_mwkp5,paradox8493,"YTA. I would've said otherwise based on what I thought your intentions were, but after reading the other comments, at the very least you went about it in the wrong way. And apparently, ""You'd rather tell the manager she did a good job than tip a little extra."" Being cheap like that makes the comments saying you were making an intentional power play/showboating seem far more credible. Had you told the waitress, ""I'd like to tell your manager personally how fantastic our service tonight was!"" Rather than just, ""I'd like to speak to your manager."" and not even saying, ""No."" when she asked if something was wrong, then I probably wouldn't have landed on the yes side. If you aren't actually an asshole, just admit to your date you went about it wrong, and make an attempt to go back and apologize to that waitress for how you went about it. Learn from this mistake and be better moving forward. Which starts with apologizing."
5,ak0zkc,t2_2dzxazg,Soulless35,"YTA ~~The way op asked for the manager was kind of mean, but I don't think it's that much of a big deal.~~ The way op asked for the manager was rude and he was trying to get a negative reaction from the server. Didn't see it at first. Got it now. Edit: to the people saying ""maybe she isn't a good listener and you're just self absorbed"" and things like this. Really? Were you there? Do you know him? It's very possible the guy has been on a streak of bad dates with other people where they were all self absorbed and he feels as though he lucked out with this girl. Insane how saying ""she's a good listener"" gets turned into ""op must just talk over her and be glad she doesn't talk at all"" Edit 2: changed from not the asshole. To, you're the asshole. Had a conversation with a friendly redditor explained it to me in a way I wasn't looking at it. I agree op is the asshole, but only for the way he asked for the manager."
5,ak0zkc,t2_2ycqr7h0,GrandmaMoustache,"YTA. Have you ever heard of yelp? Go there to compliment the server. If you couldn't do that much of a simple task, maybe try doing what normal people do and give a good tip and maybe wrote how pleased you were on the receipt. Hell, most restaurants have an 800 to call to provide a survey on your service. Sounds like your potential girlfriend dodged a bullet. You said how intelligent she is. Dating you would be beneath her."
5,ak0zkc,t2_1kg3ta3w,Drivngspaghtemonster,"NTA but I can see her point. It comes off as a little pretentious, especially since the waitress asked you specifically and you held it over her head like she’d done something wrong. I’d just cop to it. Tell your date you weren’t trying to be a jerk, but you realize it came off that way. Good luck. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_i65gk,Itsalrightmeow,"YTA, remind me of my dad.. Not on a good way. Probably made the waitress have a heart attack. Just like that girl because she's pretty and let's you talk about yourself. And asking to see a manager and making a scene? Idk maybe you don't realize but you seem kinda full of yourself.."
5,ak0zkc,t2_mtu5nfo,ConsterMock93,"YTA. One thing I wanted to point out is never apologize if you havent done anything wrong. The argument could transition from arguing about that waitress to arguing about ""well why did you say sorry if you didnt think you did anything wrong, or mean it?"""
5,ak0zkc,t2_147k2f,WistfulQuiet,"YTA You scared the hell out of that waitress. Why didn't you say I'd like to tell your manager what a wonderful job you did tonight? Also do it in a normal way instead of that creepy repeating that you'd like to see the manager. Also the girl's right. It was showing off and it's not attractive. You could have done this in a less showy way. You could have written a note on the check that she did a wonderful job. You could have left her a bigger tip. Even speaking with the manager is fine, but the way you went about it was ridiculous. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_b6iaca6,Boreall,"Unpopular opinion but i gotta call NTA, sure you could have handled it better but the way it's described here, you had good intentions. I'm going on this alone since that is what you asked about. The suspense thing is not ideal but doesn't qualify as asshole. So regarding giving the compliment, i call NTA. Furthermore, saying ""Whatever i did"" is only an asshole move if you clearly know what you did, since you're not entirely certain, she should have explained, you shouldn't have to work to find out. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_13aqby,MrRibbitt,Obviously by now you should see why YTA. Sometimes it's not your intentions that count. It's how you do it. Let this be a learning experience. Leaving a good tip without saying a word goes a lot farther than what you did. And if you want to say something nice say it right to the server. And leaving a good tip when the service is just ok says even more. If you want credit for you 'good' actions you're doing it for the wrong reason. 
5,ak0zkc,t2_1roxfa,SpecialSauce92,"YTA, but only a little bit. Your intentions were good (at least I hope they weren’t to earn your dates favor) There are just better way to go about what you wanted to do. You should have told the waitress you wanted to give positive feedback so she doesn’t freak out. I’m not sure why you date thought you were trying to impress her, but I wasn’t sitting at the table, so maybe that’s the vibe you gave off"
5,ak0zkc,t2_g5tzg,badhershey,"YTA. With a chance of the date's the asshole, too. I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt that you're not as much of an asshole as everyone else has inferred you are from this story. What you did is pretty cringey - at least from the way it's written. Sometimes this stuff doesn't translate well in a text medium. But yeah, don't make a scene to compliment someone. Just compliment them if you must and more importantly leave a good tip. It's hard to say without witnessing it all. But maybe your date took this a bit extremely, but either she's right or she's dramatic, which either way means it's for the best she's not texting back. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_12frgzgj,Classic-Rock-Jovi,"Sorry, but I'm gonna have to say YTA on that one. I work as a waitress, and the way you asked for the manager would've scared the absolute shit out of me, especially since she asked why and you wouldn't explain. I'm sure there were some good intentions there, but if you're going to do it that way, perhaps approach it a different way. A tip or a simple compliment to the waiter/waitress would suffice. Some others see it as a power play or whatnot, but I'm still undecided on that aspect of it."
5,ak0zkc,t2_32kfy7e3,ZeLoudGoddess,NTA Your date was the asshole. If she thought that was you showing off then she doesn’t deserve you. If someone did that while I was on a date I would be very impressed. But I’ve also worked as a waitress and it is so rare to find people who do that. Or even people who treat you like a person. If the girl you were dating thinks it’s weird to be kinda to people who do those kinds of services then she doesn’t deserve you tbh. She clearly thinks of no one but herself. She probably get jealous of the waitress too. Which would still make her an asshole. 
5,ak0zkc,t2_nfee6on,PutThatOnYourPlate,"YTA. It’s one thing if the manager comes over and you give a big compliment or if on the way out you mention to the hostess that the server was amazing so they can pass on the feedback; but to just tell your server “get the manager” ESPECIALLY when she did spill a drink on the table- that’s fucked. She was probably terrified you were going to tell the manager about it and your date probably saw that she looked uncomfortable when you told her to get the manager. If you don’t get it, then you clearly don’t deserve the “smart, funny good listener” you were on a date with. Side note: You clearly have never worked as a server so just so that you’re aware of it- people suck. They will go out of their way to complain over nothing because tons of restaurants give free food when people do that. So don’t ever just tell a server “get the manager” unless something is wrong. Asshole. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_1ntjfgvs,sydney_layne_,"YTA. You were clearly showing off to the girl no matter how much you deny it. Asking to speak to the manager (especially if she made a mistake and already felt bad about it) made her nervous and stressed that she messed up and that's not ok. Plus you clearly think you're all that and a bag of chips and I wouldn't be impressed either. You're clearly just looking for validation for what you think you know about the situation. So >pardon my french, but what the fuck? Yourself. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_2y17vd38,mvggiegrhee,"This happened to me today. Just got off work. Only when I asked if anything was wrong, this woman answered me like a normal person and said “no, everything is wonderful, I just know him and wanna say hi” because she wasn’t an asshole. You on the other hand.... YTA for sure. Why would you not answer her and just repeat yourself if you weren’t trying to make her nervous or pull some kind of weird power play? And because she had an excellent experience, my customer left an excellent tip. I’m guessing you left 15%. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_pwpok07,TannerTheG,"YTA Compliment waitresses by leaving a good tip and saying to manager on wayout and thanking her politely not scaring her. Also never say ""for whatever I did wrong"" because that implies you think she's the one in the wrong, you clearly know what you did to annoy her so apologise for it."
5,ak0zkc,t2_zm216uy,cmurphgarv,"NTA at all. Wtf? You paid her (the waitress) a compliment. I mean, it was a little weird not to tell the waitress why you wanted to see her manager, but I think that your date's reaction is fucking weird. Unless there is some dynamic at play here that I am missing from your description, I don't see anything wrong with what you did. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_2477xh8a,cupcakesforme,"NTA: she sounds like a bitch. I have worked in the service industry and its always good to have feedback. If shes that bent out of shape about how you worded something, move on. Good luck "
5,ak0zkc,t2_gek8car,ClarityByHilarity,YTA. It was showy. The way you repeated “I’d like to speak with your manager” when she asked if something was wrong. You were putting on a show and it gives me a really uncomfortable feeling that I’m sure your date felt too. It sounds like that wasn’t your intention but honestly it was just way too much. Cringe. Sorry dude. 
5,ak0zkc,t2_lpbcxj0,Grumpy_Roaster,YTA for being a socially inept Nice Guy who radiates neckbeard autism. The best part is the waitress smiled so he thinks she's really into him. Cringiest shit ever.
5,ak0zkc,t2_48f0e,postulio,YTA for oh so many reasons. Not the least of which you did this during a date. Jesus Christ dude you display epic levels of stupidity
5,ak0zkc,t2_2slaa2n7,salazarthesnek,"You’re NTA for giving a compliment. YTA for how you did it. You don’t ask to see a manager. Find them or leave a compliment with the host(ess). (S)he will pass it along to your server and manager, I’m sure. Or you could leave a pretty fat tip. That’ll be far more appreciated. But just to be clear, giving someone a compliment to their boss is actually a really nice thing to do - it makes them look good but you just made yourself look like a douche in front of everyone. Oh! Also you could leave an online review mentioning her name. They check that stuff and often times a review like that will get posted in the back if it mentions someone by name."
5,ak0zkc,t2_10fgnj,super_common_name,"YTA. But you would be YTA even without the whole scary prelude because **that's way too much focus on the server and not enough on your date.** Maybe if you'd been dating a long, long time AND your date was included in your plan, like ""That was a great server; let's tell her manager, okay?"" It still seems like something a couple who had been married 30 years might do, though. Also, the whole ""**ask her to be my girlfriend**"" thing. Are you 14 years old? If you meant that you wanted to ask her to be exclusive, it's way too early for that. You need a couple of months worth of regular dating. Third date is the traditional first time you have sex. Being in a relationship is a gradual buildup."
5,ak0zkc,t2_2ecfhqbk,dippybippy,YTA. If you seriously wanted to complement the waitress just leave her a generous tip and say thanks for doing such a great job. Then if you want to tell the manager call the next morning when they are slow and tell him. This was a look how nice I am to the poor waitress ploy and your date picked up on it.
5,ak0zkc,t2_lpo1q,Cavsfan2014,"NTA, Idk why everyone is saying you are. You said a very nice thing about the waitress and I’m sure that made her look better to the manager. Apparently going out of your way to be nice makes you an asshole. I’d find a new girl "
5,ak0zkc,t2_3xvjp,Skiamakhos,"NTA but I think your date thought you were paying more attention to the waitress than to her, which is not cool when you're on a date. If I think the service staff are doing a good job, I'll tend towards leaving a large tip & a really good Yelp review & mention the waiter or waitress by name there. The management will see & they'll get their kudos, but it won't make a scene (even if it's a positive one) in the restaurant."
5,ak0zkc,t2_2zmcbz0s,Teddywhitetiger,"NTA, Jesus fuck, y'all gotta calm down in the responses. The way you asked for the manager was a bit weird (probably scared the waitress a bit) but giving her a compliment was a wonderful thing to do. Sounds like your date was jealous of the attention, especially since the waitress and manager had no problem with it. The rest of y'all need to chill tf out. Dude was being nice and y'all are running to burn him at the stake, Jesus Christmas."
5,ak0zkc,t2_2nz4zq5s,thewhitewallisblue,"NTA, she shouldn't have assumed you only did it to impress her - although just out of curiosity, did you? Is this something you would have done if not on a date? Next time though, if you really want to make the waitress feel good, I wouldn't let her believe you're calling the manager for something negative even for a second! I bet she was stressed out before she heard what you had to say."
5,ak0zkc,t2_13netj,Catman419,"YTA. That could have been handled differently. One way would have been to talk to the date first, “You know, I’ve been here a couple of times, but tonight that server was amazing! I really hope the managers know how hard she works.” It would prep the date that you were going to compliment the waitress without looking too smarmy. On the other hand, you could have taken the date home, banged her, and *then* called the manager and given the compliment. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_29hqpsx2,Lady_krolux,"YTA Not only is that the most obnoxious way to compliment wait staff I coild think of, but then you actually said ""sorry for whatever I did wrong"". That doesnt earn you brownie points, I'd rather you didn't apologize than gey that load of bollocks of I were on a date with you. Get your head out of your ass and learn from this experience."
5,ak0zkc,t2_2c2q3ly2,a_flying_stegosaurus,YTA. You clearly tried to be nice so I feel bad for you but you could have just complimented the waiter and maybe a larger than normal tip. But to make a suspense and show out of it makes it seem sketchy to me.
5,ak0zkc,t2_21qxl3f5,ShadowChicken032,"I’m going with YTA. This entire situation is a lot like the people who go “not touching can’t get mad, not touching can’t get mad”. This entire situation isn’t about what great service she did but more about you being funny and cute. I’d love to know how much you tipped. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_2j3k95bf,Lr217,"NTA unless you were literally trying to be an asshole. All these people acting like you're some kind of fucking monster are just absurd. You definitely made the waitress think that she did something wrong but you aren't an asshole for that, you likely didn't any better and didn't think you were being rude. Next time just let her know why you want to talk to the manager. You are not an asshole for making a waitress stressed out for a little while. If you do it again, then maybe."
5,ak0zkc,t2_120wprko,br094,"YTA for sure. First off, click bait title for sure. But the main problem is the way you did it. You demonstrated an ego issue, and she doesn’t like you because of it. In the future, stop being so prideful. It’s not cool, it’s not funny, you need to grow up. And that’s my honest constructive criticism. "
5,ak0zkc,t2_p65y4r,SelfConfessedCreep,"I Can't decide wether to put NTA or ESH. (Sorry, I know that doesn't help the algorithm) I Wouldn't say you were being a complete a-hole, just behaving a bit weirdly and being mildly cruel. However I Don't think that warrants her response here. You had good intentions, she didn't have to stay in a mood for the rest of the night. She should have just said, 'That was a bit weird/cruel, you shouldn't do that.'"
5,ak0zkc,t2_2zld2gmk,RichieDuck,NTA cause doing nice things doesn’t mean you’re trying to impress someone always. I do nice things but not to impress people I do it to be nice. I wouldn’t date someone who gets mad about that cause that means that if you guys keep dating she’s gonna get mad at more stupid stuff cause she’s stupid so go find a different date okay
5,ak0zkc,t2_zp99d,DunneyC,NTA. All the ppl calling this person an asshole are assholes. As a former server it would have been a pleasant surprise for that to happen to me. Cant believe the overwhelming consensus of ur the asshole. U did nothing wrong my friend. Cheers.
5,ak0zkc,t2_1cdotn5q,Santadid911,NTA. I don’t get why everyone thinks you are? I would have felt proud if someone wanted to tell my manager that I offered great service.

However, I would definitely look into scholarships and ways to help pay at these out-of-state schools if I were you, that should help with the guilt. You're not being the asshole, you're just taking advantage of their offer. While it's not asshole territory, and it's not ideal (life and paying for school sucks), you can improve things doing what I said above (financial aid, part-time job, scholarships at the out-of-state schools).

It's very nice that you are considering their feelings but you're not the asshole accepting their aid help at a school that would be better for you. Turn the facts a little bit. Say U gives you a full ride but has a shitty program for what you want to do.

5,afrsu0,t2_1tzq9iyk,spectra27,"YTA you have no way of knowing if she is depressed or not. It’s not your business. As someone who struggles with anxiety and depression myself, you should be ashamed of what you did. Not everyone exhibits symptoms the same way.

5,acww5m,t2_ehua9,FreddieTheDoggie,"YTA. You are judging her food, but you choose to rationalize it as informing her off nutritional information. I'm sure this may not have been the first time you've judged her food choices either and she finally cracked. As you said, she is an adult. If she asks for your expert commentary on her food, happily offer it. But if not, keep it to yourself."
5,acww5m,t2_rdh6z,Vrassk,YTA but its deeper than a simple comment. She needs to feel safe and ok with her choices around you. If she eats a sandwich and you make a negative comment she will have to put up a defense around you or fear judgement. It's no longer a relaxing moment but a tense one. No one likes to be on guard around their so or in their home. 
5,acww5m,t2_r0ugwcl,WeAreTheMisfits,"YTA \-""I in no way judge her food."" Then why comment on it. Your comment is a judgement and believe me you do it often if she broke down and cried about it. She is eating this way to please you. Maybe you should appreciate that and not comment on it to please and respect her. \- ""I'm just bringing up the nutrition aspect of her food"" - I am judging your food as not being nutritious enough and therefore the wrong choice. Don't do that again. \- ""She is the adult and is able to make her own dietary choices"" - Except that you don't actually practice this, you just say this to make yourself feel better about judging someone. She can make the right choice as she is smart and an adult, but you know she is making the wrong choice because you are right. \-"" just trying to bring up talking points on nutrition""- you brought up judging points on nutrition, not talking points. Your food choices are a choice and she is appeasing you. Stop treating her this way. It is controlling, judgmental and degrading. You aren't helping her. You are putting her down, telling her she is stupid and less than you. It is gross and immoral behavior. This example makes me question what other behaviors you have in your relationship that are about you having your way. When at any point you bring someone to tears, you need to really stop and evaluate yourself. "

Based on this interaction, I suggest you eat more of them. Kidding, but seriously, of course you’re the asshole. You’re judging your girlfriends food. First rule of dealing with women: Never make any comment that could be interpreted to be insulting their appearance. That includes comments on what they eat, how much exercise they do, if they’ve gained weight, negative opinions of clothing or makeup choices, etc..."
5,acww5m,t2_npcu11l,mathxjunkii,"YTA. And her breakfast sandwich sounds delicious. Did she make it herself or did she stop by Panera? Panera has something very similar, and I 100% recommend their breakfast sandwiches if she enjoys that type of thing- let her know that, would you?

5,acww5m,t2_gut70yi,DurandirX,"YTA + INFO I think you didn't tell the full story, nobody cries for a comment on food except if there is something else going on.

5,acww5m,t2_1310vc,FlokiTrainer,"YTA - You spent your entire first paragraph judging her food choices. Your second paragraph was just uncalled for. If she is eating healthy, what do you care?

Even if it isn't your intention, most people are very sensitive about that topic and will see you as an asshole for even thinking of mentioning that kind of thing.

5,acww5m,t2_v52u5,enigmaticowl,"YTA. You yourself said that she eats healthily, so clearly you know that she knows what is healthy and what is not. You know that you weren’t “enlightening” or “educating” her on nutrition because she already knows healthy from unhealthy. So if you didn’t want to share knowledge, you clearly had to have been sharing an opinion. And she already knows she splurging, I’m sure that’s not just a careless decision for her, she probably had already thought it over and finally decided to give in to a craving this time, and then you go and make her feel even shittier? Yeah, YTA. Not sorry."
5,acww5m,t2_2emokka3,bastigesinatree,"YTA. STFU. You eat your paleo and STFU about her food choices. Are you her doctor? Is she 2 years old wanting candy and ice cream for every meal for six months and you're her parent? No? Then shut your mouth.

5,acww5m,t2_yg8kz,danimals3,YTA. No one asked you dude. STFU. And stop defending yourself saying it was just commentary on the “nutritional aspect” of her food (“it’s not like I forbade her from eating it”). Yeah that’s not an important distinction worth making. The point is you couldn’t HELP yourself having to explain to her a simple concept I guarantee you she gets. Like you just had to blurt it out. Do you feel compelled to do this at other times too? I’m asking because your GF CRIED. That sort of reaction cold possibly mean she is fed up as all hell.
5,acww5m,t2_hl2p8ed,ForkMinus1,"YTA Unless she asks you about her food choices, poses a serious health risk to herself due to what she eats, or her food directly bothers you (smells bad, noisy to eat, etc.), you probably shouldn't have said anything."

You're trying to guilt her into not eating something, and that fosters an unhealthy relationship with food. I'm personally vegan and eat (kinda) healthy and my SO is not. I NEVER comment on his food about environment, animal rights, nutrition, etc. because it's NOT my place. You're being a dick so you should stop it. "
5,a6b37y,t2_2ca6kc50,Yeti616,"NTA - I guess.. I mean, I doesn't sound like the relationship was going well in the first place so breaking up was probably a good move.

You want, you buy, etc. Hubby makes more money than me, and he has a more expensive car, and gadgets from Amazon. LOL I work a side gig for extra money, and I buy crap from the thrift store. But the NECESSITIES are 50/50 Don't be afraid to tell him to suck it up, or pay rent on his own.

5,b1z6r2,t2_q373g,NoctiferPrime,"YTA. It was a bit of a roller coaster for me reading through your post, as an adult with a step-parent. To preface, let me say good on you for giving it your best effort to form a good relationship with your step-daughter, I wish my step-dad had given any kind of shit about me. Where you're the asshole is assuming that she should turn 18 and immediately leave, or that somehow you've ""put your time in."" When you form a romantic relationship with someone, they are a package deal with their children. Maybe they'll move out at 18, maybe they'll stay much longer for whatever reason. It's understandable, honestly, that you want it to just be you and your fiance. But when and how your step-daughter leaves is not your call, in any way, ever. Feel free to talk to your fiance about it and express your concerns, but you would absolutely be a massive asshole if you just booted her. >My fiancé will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it’s for the best. For the best, *for who*, exactly? It won't take long for your fiance to realize that it was a selfish decision on your part. I don't know just how close your fiance and her daughter are, but it sounds like they have a very good relationship. If she loves having her there, and you just kick her out, at bare minimum she will resent you for it. In my case, my Mother would have *left* my step-father before she ever let him kick me out before I was ready. Is it really worth potentially blowing up your relationship with your fiance just to get rid of her daughter? Kick her out if you want, but don't be surprised if you end up alone. "
5,b1z6r2,t2_407rv58,AggressivelyEthical,"YTA, and judging by how you've replied to other commenters, I think you're also exaggerating or misrepresenting how disrespectful the daughter is to you. I believe that you feel it's your house, your fiancée, but not your daughter, and you just want her out. You need to understand that tying yourself to her mother means you get the kid too as a package deal, and chances are if you kick one out the other goes, as well. You should reconsider your mean-spiritedness and just wait until the daughter has saved enough to move out of the house on her own, or you risk living there alone."
5,b1z6r2,t2_elfuf,waterbuffalo750,"YTA. This is a tough one for me. I'm really not opposed with making an adult move out of the house, they should move out of the house. But you've just got a lot working against you here. You're ultimately holding a grudge for a teenage girl being moody with a stepdad that came into the picture as she was old enough to resent the idea. And claiming ""it's your house"" is pretty petty. You need to get that figured out so everyone feels like they have a home, whether that involves fiance paying rent, or redoing the deed, or whatever it takes. It's a family home. "
5,b1z6r2,t2_27ajcae2,amandae123,"YTA: the way you keep saying your house means that this isn’t a real partnership between you and your fiancé. Also, what do you consider being disrespectful? I can tell you that if you kick her out, your fiancé will probably go with her, so make sure you are prepared for that "
5,b1z6r2,t2_2qzpxthr,golddustwitch,YTA- shes only 19??? most people don't move out of their houses right after high school although I wouldn't blame her if she did want to with the way you are acting. You should care how she takes it - you're in a long term relationship with her mother who loves having her there. 
5,b1z6r2,t2_9d4jv,readerchick,YTA. Your SO will be a mom for the rest of her life. That doesn’t mean daughter will live with you forever but she will still be a parent and have to deal with daughter’s issues for the rest of her life. It sounds like you were expecting her to leave the day she turned 18. She’s pretty young still. She may leave and come back. If she is disrespectful towards you then that should be dealt with. Does she help around the house or pay rent? Does the mom even want her to pay rent? A lot of parents don’t but she can at least be doing chores. 
5,b1z6r2,t2_la80h8z,maps_on_the_wall,"-I don’t care how she really takes it YTA. You’re throwing out the feelings of her, and you obviously don’t care about her if you put step daughter in quotes but not fiancé. You stated yourself her mother loves having her daughter around. If you don’t like it you have no legal obligation holding you back. "
5,b1z6r2,t2_1628qf01,OrangeSockMonkey,"YTA if you do this without your fiancee being ok with it. That's still her daughter even if she is an adult, also not all children up and leave right after high school. You should have considered this when you got involved."
5,b1z6r2,t2_rsoto,eatthebunnytoo,"YTA I would have gone with you not being an asshole but other than saying you expect a 19 year old to be fully financially independent and that you don’t have a relationship with her, I’m really not seeing that she is unreasonable to be living with her mother. She has a job too, so not like she is loading at home smoking weed. I’m going to guess she saw right through your attempt to make a relationship happen by buying her a car. "
5,b1z6r2,t2_471l0f1,throwaway_ay_ay_ay99,"YTA All your “It’s my house” responses make it seem like you’re not really looking for clarity here and mostly just validation, which I don’t think ya got. Also YTSnowflake. You didn’t mention anything but indifference from your step daughter. I’d gladly take indifference from some of m family members. Try harder, be more creative, but if “It’s my house” is your mentality then I’m guessing your tries weren’t all that great."
5,b1z6r2,t2_30s3ube,my-sweetestfriend,"YTA. Your girlfriend and her daughter are a package deal. Also, kicking her out would be inappropriate considering she hasn't done anything notably bad, you just want the house to yourself. Sure, maybe you can help encourage her to start saving or planning for the future, or help her take steps to become independent, but kicking her out for virtually no reason and springing that on your girlfriend would be a really bad idea and would definitely make you the asshole. Try another approach. "
5,b1z6r2,t2_ducfj,Cockwombles,"YTA The worst thing anyone can feel is not welcome in their own home. It will cause her problems for life. She already probably went through something unsettling when her parents split up, and she needs stability still even though she is growing up. Above all, it’s really not your decision, it is her mothers. If it will upset your fiancé, why are you even considering it? Doing this will turn them both against you, or cause a rift between the mother and daughter. Chances are about 50/50 that you will be the one leaving. >To be blunt I don’t really care how she takes it. My fiancé will probably be a little upset. Yes you are an asshole. No. You really have no say in this, sorry. You can discuss your feelings with your fiancée, but I think it’s just something you have to put up with for a few more years."
5,b1z6r2,t2_2pg70np3,Exiled_From_Twitter,"YTA. But what a shitty situation you're in. If you were to just attempt to kick her out without consulting her mother that would be classic asshole. It's your girlfriends house just as well and you can't unilaterally kick out her daughter. Of course you would be justified in pressing your gf on wtf is going on with her daughter and even push to get her to leave. I mean I completely understand where you're coming from, and I empathize, but that's just the nature of your relationship right now. "
5,b1z6r2,t2_16cvlk,LowRentMegazord,YTA. >I really feel like I’ve put my time in This is why it's so fucked up when people with children remarry. Now she has some jackass living with her completely indifferent to her child constantly trying to whittle away at their relationship.

I know it sucks being the step parent but its what you signed up to when you started dating someone with a kid. Im sorry she was a cunt about the car but that still doesnt give you a right to kick her out. 
5,b1z6r2,t2_4go1hyy,BrownEyedQueen1982,"YTA You don’t come between a parent and her child. If your gf wants her daughter out she will talk to her. Until then mind your own business. Being indifferent towards you is not disrespect. Respect is earned not given, and other than trying to buy her affection with a car, what have you done to ever try to get to know her? "
5,b1z6r2,t2_1hq21elc,littlebabyheifer,"Yta, no need to kick her out but you could just take away the things that you gave her; such as the car— etc. if she has a job then she can save up to buy her own. Your fiancée can assist with helping her buy a new car if that’s the case. Just do basic discipline of taking away things. No need to make her homeless. From now on, just make her pay her own bills and buy her own car."
5,b1z6r2,t2_1ibz3jtz,goodatbeingaverage,"Eww. Eww. YTA. You are sooo the asshole. Your fiancé loves having her barely-an-adult daughter around, she’s trying to be responsible and save instead of moving out before she can afford it, and you just want to kick her out? You’ve been in a relationship with your fiancé for 8 years, but she’s had a relationship with her daughter for 19 years, and in only one of those relationships does she have a lifelong commitment. Get over yourself. "
5,b1z6r2,t2_32evy,krunk7,"YTA for how you’re going about this. Kids are kids, so holding a grudge against a kid is pretty immature. That being said, once 18 you have two life paths: continue your education or start your career (and pay your own way). Doesn’t mean you don’t help her get on her feet or save up for deposit/first months rent and bills. But there should be a clear and reasonable plan with dates and timelines. If not, that’s how “kids” end up living with you till they’re 30."
5,b1z6r2,t2_2kqzj3jn,feedbacksandwich,"NTA. But there is a real problem here with you and mom not being on the same page re parenting. Sounds like you have been very supportive money wise.

5,b1tr3a,t2_v0n654f,midnightyell512,"YTA - I could have gone either direction with this, but it comes down to: if she doesn't seem to care, she probably doesn't.

It may have something to do with the $1500 price - wow, that’s a lot for a cat! Still tho. I think it’s a reasonable option rather than forcing those two cats to live together. "

5,adrjgb,t2_wqks4tb,finianden,"NTA- I actually think it’s really great that you’re considering it, as it definitely sounds like the best option for both cats. You’d know both cats are happier, plus you have the peace of mind of knowing that she’ll take great care of the cat. "
5,b49vtm,t2_2zi8oo1z,lexen3997,"NTA. What I'm about to say sucks, you need to let it go. She is an adult, one that can make her own decisions, shitty ones at that, but her decisions regardless. I have a friend like this, except the guy is her age, I'm just waiting for the inevitable end and ready to support her thru it. This man is older, he knows what to push and when to do so, you're not gonna do anything but make her weary of being around you. Just gotta wait it out and hope she gains enough sense to drop the asshole. "

I agree that as a friend you should try to make her realize what a shitty person he is. But how to approach this - ask someone with more understanding of psychology and how to help someone in an abusive relationship. Never stop continuing being her friend. When she does eventually realise what kind of person he is, she will need someone she trusts and that she can go to for support."

Really really think about it. Also, really think about the fallout.....she is not under any legal obligation to keep you on her insurance or pay for your school.

5,b5chit,t2_2n47k6le,KZCrow,"NTA - their IT problems arent your concern. I'd refrain from charging them though. If it's simple enough that you feel like you can fix it and you feel generous enough do it. You never know when you'll be in a situation similar to theirs.

That being said, at least do him the favor of explaining how you feel and communicating all of that to him. Don't pressure him or give him a real ultimatum or anything - you definitely would be the asshole for that. But make it clear to him that you want a certain thing, and that if he can't provide it to you, you aren't going to waste your time with the relationship."
5,b4dxso,t2_17a3rc,MsCardeno,NTA - it’s nice some people prioritize that stuff and are so passionate but you have to focus on your wellbeing and life as well. This is coming from a married lesbian. Don’t let them make you feel bad 
5,b0qmsz,t2_3djijb6d,Michael_Scott_1001,"NTA - You're right, it is weird that she takes their pictures but it's not really your issue. I'd just tell her that it's weird and stalkerish just so she knows it's not normal behavior and move on. It sounds like you've already done that, so nothing you can really do. One day she'll look back on this and cringe hard tho"
5,aruqj6,t2_ky8w6,Aguyontheinterwebs,"NTA. Your sister has some deep seeded issues when it comes to other women and their children. She literally shit talked a baby. It could possibly be because she is jealous and wants another child. Here is a thread from a forum where women share their thoughts on pregnancy, this particular thread from women experienced miscarriages and loss discussing their irrational but ever present anger/jealousy towards other pregnant women: [https://forums.thebump.com/discussion/5669519/is-anyone-else-angry-jealous-towards-pregnant-women](https://forums.thebump.com/discussion/5669519/is-anyone-else-angry-jealous-towards-pregnant-women) Though, this usually happens when a woman finds out she's infertile and can't have a baby, or has lost a child. It seems odd that your sister is acting in such a way unless something happened that she hasn't told you. I could be reading too much into it, or your sister just thinks that things she has done for your nephew are reserved only for them and can be nobody else's original idea. And it will extend to other things, Birthday gifts, vacations, whether your nephew joins a sport. She definitely craves some form of drama in her otherwise boring life if this is the case."

Honestly Your WIFE may not even want to be there herself and will likely hold it against you if you don't go and leave her alone in her obligation. It's lose-lose so might as well take your medicine gracefully. Also it's a catch 22. If she is the mythical unicorn who genuinely won't hold a grudge against you, then she is worth sucking it up for.

Your wife's family is your's now - congrats - and unless there's some major reason why you don't get along, like them being rude or abusive to you, suck it up and go.

5,aeg8xj,t2_2nz4zq5s,thewhitewallisblue,"NTA but you're going about it the wrong way. Instead of trying to control his behaviour, focus on your own. He obviously can't send a clear message to save his life (""I love you, but I don't want to be together"" = WTF) so you need to decide what you want to do about this and act accordingly. You can break this off yourself without telling him to change his behaviour - just be done, he clearly doesn't know what he wants."
5,axy8hn,t2_37v86r26,Error40561,"NTA This is just giving you a hint of who your boyfriend really is - manipulative, passive-aggressive, immature and insecure. A healthy adult would simply leave you if you cheated on them. It doesn't bode well to be dating someone with this mentality."
5,axy8hn,t2_32599a2,KylexLumien,"NTA/NAH I don't think your BF is at the best stage to be in a relationship. He seems to have some issues. In your shoes, I would be worried that what he's saying could also mean if he ever cheated, he'd just expect you to cheat back and everything would be flowers and sunshine, again. I think you both really need to figure out whether you're on the same page because, although it's just hypothetical, it can carry over to other areas of the relationship."
5,axy8hn,t2_kv520,Curiousdragon,"NTA-You should dump him and encourage him to work on his confidence. Sounds lame being with a guy that is so emotionally immature. His ex was wise to leave him. And probably did for the same reason, but he is a victim in his own mind. You do you though. "
5,b1fa7j,t2_173trb,ha3lo,"YTA if you ask her, yes. What she does on her accounts is none of your business especially since you’re not together anymore.

They’re hers, she can do what she likes with them. "

5,aftnyt,t2_4at5t,Lucavious,"NTA. You can stay with him, sure. But you absolutely can't trust him. He's cheated twice and maybe more. He will cheat again. It would be silly to continue on as though there's any chance of a typical relationship when it's been proven time and again he doesn't have what it takes."
5,aftnyt,t2_doqtb,MadoogsL,NTA Clearly you have multiple reasons not to trust your bf (including cheating before and the ex knowing stuff she could only have known if he told her).

5,b10y9w,t2_1qkdksp2,oops_itwasme,"NTA, neither is your brother really. Your parents kinda are though. He's 12, he's been playing the games and won't want to stop, you'd have been the same and hell, I bet you still are now. You don't like having to stop mid game. For that reason I'd say you and your brother have a chat and work something out, if you don't play the game, why take it, he can play it? Also, when's his birthday, could see about getting him his own copy of one or two of his favourites? "
5,b8z7fh,t2_2k4gave0,GoldGangsta0211,"NTA: 4 dogs, 2 are yours, one randomly pees and the last randomly growls. Why don't you ask your friend that they just keep their dogs in their backyard and you just go over to their place to feed the dogs. Makes life easier."

Also &#x200B; >His reply was that “if you think that was yelling.. you have no idea. I can show you what yelling is”. &#x200B; This is a direct THREAT TO YOU. I would run. Seriously.

5,a3vjz3,t2_164d1x40,imsorrybutihad2,NTA. Sounds like your weathering quiet the storm. No clue the right thing to do but . . . Feel what you feel and be honest about it with no guilt. The confliction just makes clarity harder. Maybe therapy for yourself is a good option. Or family therapy with your husband. You’ll work through this.
5,a3vjz3,t2_bg4sp,Killairmanable,"NTA https://www.today.com/parents/it-takes-more-love-what-happens-when-adoption-fails-918076 I take it that you’ve probably already read this article, but it helped me gain a little perspective on your situation. It sounds like a horrible situation for anyone to be in, but ultimately you have to do what’s best for everyone, even if that means sending a child back to the adoption agency. "
5,a3vjz3,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"NTA. You admit you can't control him and you say you feel like he feels nothing for you. He's terrorizing his school. If he's a nightmare at 6, imagine 8. 10. 14. He's strong and apathetic now. What about when he can really hurt you and others at school? The therapy isn't working, and you know that you can't fix what he has. *You have a diagnosis, and that diagnosis says you can't fix this.* People will ignore that and tell you to keep trying, even though you're miserable, he's miserable, and his school and the other kids are miserable. You're not wrong to admit you can't handle him. Bad parents would insist they could handle it, while failing to control him. You've read about the parents where there child kills someone, and you wonder how they didn't get that child to someone who could handle them before it happened. Your life is a nightmare. Get him the help he needs and help yourself. Anyone who shames you doesn't understand the danger you're putting yourself and others in if he is violent and uncontrollable. You're unhappy, he's unhappy. Don't wait until he's 8."
5,a3vjz3,t2_6yuaf,Viperbunny,"NTA. You are in a really tough situation. You are doing all you can. I don't fault you for having issues. People don't understand how hard parenting is without these issues. This disorder is so challenging. I wish I had advice. It sounds like you are tired and beaten down. Can you see if you qualify for any services? Is the school providing him with the services he needs? There may not be much you can do. You may want to try /r/parenting because there may be people who can offer you advice. Whatever happens, whatever you choose, it sounds like you have tried really hard."
5,a3vjz3,t2_trrnrz,thatssjtoyou,"I have no experience with adoption at all but I kinda think YTA. I understand he has issues but...hes a child. He's your child. I guarantee that if this was your biological son nobody in the comments would be telling you to put him up for adoption. You arent a terrible person for being worn down, but you'll be an asshole if you return him."
5,a3vjz3,t2_jq3ya,Superspick,"NTA, but you shouldn’t be alone in making this and you’ve said nothing about your partner. It is not the only option, but if it’s the best one for most (because if it gets worse, it won’t be just you suffering) then you do it. Don’t expect that to be easy either, of course. Logic dictates you learn the full scope of the situation before making a decision. A therapist doesn’t possess the knowledge to get a sufficient scope of what is needed (long term), imo, and it demands more knowledge."
5,a3vjz3,t2_ia0fz,iimorbiid,"NTA You do whatever you feel is right, nothing else. Also I'm probably gonna get downvoted for this but why are people saying ""it's not like adopting a pet, you're actually taking responsibility for a child"" am I the only fucker here that actually believes that adopting a pet is just as big a commitment? I would **never** give up any of my animals for any reason, people here seems to think ""it's only animals"" which disgusts me. The difference here is that you say it might be a matter of your own safety, if you feel that you are not safe in your own home then you have to make the decision whether to continue raising this child or not. "
5,a3vjz3,t2_p9f3n,bradferg,"NTA. You should be seeing a therapist, too. Shit seems tough to deal with. The top comments seems to give the best advice. You're not the perfect angel sent to fix everyone. You just do your best. Don't beat yourself up--whatever your decisions."
5,a3vjz3,t2_bqnfgj6,Lostkiddo101,"Sorry OP, YTA After having a child for 3 years you’re already considering giving up on him? Would you put your bio child up for adoption after 3 years if they had a mental or developmental disorder? Parenting is 18 years of commitment at minimum, at max it’s a lifetime commitment. If you don’t think you can handle him, you should 100% give him up but please stay away from fostering/adopting in the future. Abandonment for a child that’s already experienced it feels like hell."
5,a3vjz3,t2_118sbx,LRLI,"You're not an asshole,but YTA if you give him back,simply because you wanted a child and you couldn't give back one you gave birth to if they had a disability - he's not a toy"
5,a3vjz3,t2_1f0l4mu,bebespeaks,"NTA. Many adopted kids have trouble adjusting to new families/homes/environments. Not just for a few weeks, or months. Many kids struggle for years and years on end. Some dont experience an end. It doesn't matter where they come from or who their original parents were, it is what it is. I see your edits to your original post, and I agree that more intensive CBT is needed. Maybe a speech therapist and an occupational therapist, a play therapist could be or help as well. As the boy gets older, maybe an acting coach and a kids acting/theater class might be of help. I dont have any Xp with adoption, but I can read into this that the child needs more help than what has been provided...probably until age 21, if not even longer than that. "
5,a3vjz3,t2_raprb,Loveyouguysbut,"NTA. You’ve got to think about the rest of your life. Is this how you want to live? It’s a horrible situation you’re in. A friend told me about one of her friends who had to “give back” a 6 year old adopted son who touched her in a sexual way. It was too much for her to handle. I think I would’ve done the same thing. It’s not the child’s fault, it’s just that most people lack the capability or skills to handle certain emotional traumas. Good luck with whatever you decide. "
5,a3vjz3,t2_1oz6q2h1,emileo425,"NTA. Don't listen to the people on here that are trying to make you feel bad about your life. In the end, you can't live your life with regret and you can't live your life pleasing other people's feelings. Forget that. Try all your avenues and have everything documented and do what you have to do. Sometimes things don't work out and there isn't anything wrong with that!"
5,a3vjz3,t2_2ot5u8ar,reddi2K,"YTA You seem like educated, compassionate people. You are his best, the only chance he's got. He may be in your lives to TEACH you something. It will be a hard road at times, but you must have understood that adopting a child at that age is fraught with risk especially coming from Haiti. Sometimes adorable toddlers and pre-Ks grow up to be hateful little kids. Hopefully therapy and meds can help him in this difficult phase of his life. Also, be sure he has plenty of time around kids and adults that look like HIM. God Bless. "
5,a3vjz3,t2_265c6n8v,ThisisLukes,"YTA. You can't just give the kid back like some gift you didn't want. He was put in the system as a baby who knows what he's been thru. You can't use generic tactics you get on forums to ""fix"" his behavior. Kids feel tremendously and can tell what's what. This kid needs more attention, more love. Home school setting would be good so you have more time to spend with him, to get to know him, to let him know that he is loved and cared for. Yes, you're an asshole for even considering to ""give back"" a child you've had for 3 years already. Maybe you should've took nature's sign that motherhood wasn't for you in the first place. Would you have given your child up for adoption if you had a baby who was a challenge or would you have loved them unconditionally and did whatever you needed to do for that baby? That child's been thru enough. I can't imagine how it would feel to be given back because I wasn't worth the effort. "
5,a3vjz3,t2_d2houhg,cleverbutnotoverlyso,"NTA. You’re still human. Some people are better equipped to handle the stresses of parenthood than others and it’s a whole other thing if the kid has special needs, especially if you didn’t know it when you got him. No matter what you do, be sure to do it for the right reasons and to the benefit of all. Wishing you peace, patience and wisdom to do the right thing for everyone."
5,a3vjz3,t2_15ncks,AnimeDreama,"NTA. What you are going through is overwhelmingly difficult forcanybody to deal with. Your emotions are valid and don't make you a bad or evil person. You clearly love your son or this wouldn't be a difficult thing for you to consider. RAD is a very difficult disorder to work with amd I don't envy you. There is no easy answer or solution here. All I can tell you is to continue to love him the best you can, give him attention and continue to work with him and therapists."

Perhaps second opinions or an iep would help things. Either way, you're walking through a difficult season and I wish you the best. "
5,ae3ifk,t2_3eosam7,bubbsnana,"NTA. Since it happened more than once, it would’ve been a good idea to be more direct in your answer rather than saying “anything but jewelry”. Like maybe say a few specific items. Maybe you could’ve gotten a new car jk lol. It reminds me of that book about Love Languages. There’s a type where the way they show love is giving gifts. "
5,a4o62b,t2_focdf0o,catzinthecity,"ESH. You said in your post that your relationship was affected, and of course your mental health affects your relationship. But then later you said you are the main person affected and sort of implied it shouldn't matter to her if you go or not. But when you're in a relationship your SO is also affected so it does impact her when you don't get help. Her response of course wasn't helpful and was shitty too but she isn't wrong to feel slighted by you not getting the help you need. But I also sort of think there is more to this story if one snippy comment about something frustrating caused a break up. "
5,allagl,t2_3wvxcmu,Thyperson08,"YTA for being so incredibly sensitive about what other people think of material things you like. It's not like she was insulting your integrity, lifestyle or beliefs. Like an earlier comment said...take a chill pill dude and look inside yourself to see why you get offended by such trivial things so easily. "
5,allagl,t2_jdubj,BullyFU,"YTA, the Beetle is a girly car and you getting upset over that, when you don't own one and aren't in the process of purchasing one, is ridiculous. It seems it was fairly innocent teasing on her part that you took way too literally and decided to get bent out of shape over it. You know it's stupid to get offended over that but you're still trying to spin things in a way where you can come out on top and that's childish. Get over it, it's just a car that you don't own. "
5,allagl,t2_ga8ykjb,hamboy315,"ESH. this is the most nonissue argument I’ve ever seen. If this is the type of shit y’all argue about, things seem pretty solid. Shes clearly being annoying and judgmental, and you’re reacting like she was insulting yo momma. However, if this is an example of how you’re always fighting about stupid shit, then there’s a bigger issue here and y’all should address that and question whether you’re a good fit for each other. "
5,allagl,t2_hfzic,notevenapro,NTA. You have a right to be your opinion and she mocked you and insinuated you had anal sex. Just an FYI. It is a girly car just like pink but some of us can rock those girly things. 
5,aqprov,t2_4zyy5,TheBestCheese,"YTA I think you overreacted - I really doubt that your cousin is your mom's minion. You don't need to have any contact with your cousin if you don't want to, not you basically ghosted someone, and that's not cool. "

He Who Must Not Be Named. And, most importantly, in response to “young lady” it should be “old man.” People don’t get to just declare their authority in your life. That is something you grant them. "
5,ba8jpv,t2_28dv1764,Nyctophobiana,"NTA I think what you're doing is hilarious. But, really, he can't force you to call him dad. Just keep saying no when he tells you to. Let him huff and puff and look like a lunatic over your simple no. You could also start calling him ""not dad""."
5,ba8jpv,t2_2lm9dv0i,coco-coco-coco,"NTA he never should have tried to get you to call him “Dad” and your mother should have told him you are not going to call him “dad”. . .your stepfather sounds like a malignant personality who is literally loafing all day. This creep knows exactly what he’s doing—he’s the asshole. However, by poking the bear you may be making life harder for yourself. I think you should stop sarcastically calling him “Daddy” for your own well-being only. And no way in hell does this guy deserve the title of “dad”."
5,ba8jpv,t2_10kzanl4,TombBroom,"Hmmm NTA. He has no right to force you to call him ‘dad’. He is not your father and if he wants the title he needs to earn it, if he ever will. I know people who refer to their step parent as their name but still have a great relationship, they just don’t replace the other parent. "
5,ba8jpv,t2_24751cic,MissLucy333,"ESH, but 100% something I would do. Sprinkle in a couple names like, ""Parental Unit"" and ""Father figure"". Double down on the weird, and never call him ""dad"".

5,ba8jpv,t2_29zhituz,ChasingMyCoattails,"NTA but this is hilarious. I switched from calling my father ""daddy/dad"" to pops because of some of the weird shit I've been witness to on the internet. If I called anyone ""daddy"" anymore, it would either be as a joke or because I wanted to make someone uncomfortable. That being said, I'd be annoyed af too if my mom's boyfriend asked me to call him dad. It's just weird. If he's not taking no for an answer, I'm thinking having a private convo with your mom about the situation might be good. I know she doesn't wanna take sides but you are her daughter and she needs to hear you. It's not right that she refuses to do anything about this even though it clearly makes you uncomfortable. And if she just straight up refuses to do anything, well, I guess she'll just have to get used to her 16 year old daughter calling her husband ""daddy"". "
5,ashi8g,t2_jvhpq,redstonecyanide,"YTA in this situation, but it sounds like you know that. I'm sorry, I know that probably sounds harsh. I know you're just trying to have friends and fit in, and that can be really tough at your age. Learn from this. 1. Just because they've developed a new hobby doesn't mean they dislike the old stuff. You can still have conversations about that stuff too. Maybe they're all talking about the new thing, but be on the lookout for ways to start a conversation, such as a new videogame or anime. Like, ""Hey have you guys seen Apex Legends? What do you think about it?"" 2. If you feel like they're unresponsive to you and your ideas, it's okay to let them know you're feeling left out. 3. If your friends in one group are completely unresponsive to you, it's okay to look for more people who share your interests. You can be friends with both groups. 4. You don't need to have large groups of friends to be validated, and you really shouldn't have to try super hard to fit in to a group or get that group's attention. 5. You can still apologize to them and try to fix things, if that's what you want to do."
5,b84s9a,t2_j48vv,ToTTenTranz,"First off, write the essay. It's just highschool. No one cares. &#x200B; Second, YTA for thinking that will ""prove the teacher wrong"". It's an opinion over fictitious characters in a movie. You have your opinion and others will have theirs, like your teacher. &#x200B; I'd say if your teacher is a good teacher, he might be impressed by your tenacity to hold your argument in a constructive form through a well redacted text. Just do it to reinforce your argument, and not to ""prove your teacher wrong"" because that's just petty and childish (even for a 10 grader, honestly)."
5,b84s9a,t2_xv636,ex-inteller,"YTA. Starting shit with your teacher is a dumb idea. Accept that no one agreed with you, and you sound like a weirdo. Maybe work on why you feel the need to do this dumb, weird shit, perhaps with a therapist."
5,azdk7v,t2_qb4c6q5,Smilla-vins,"YTA. You seriously crossed a line. This is such an incredible intimate thing to do, even with the other person being aware. I wouldn’t even consider wearing the boxer shorts of my boyfriend without asking him first. Edit: Guys wearing panties designed for women is considered a fetish. So there is also the sexual side of that. That you allegedly did that with your sisters underwear too gives me SHP-vibes. You can’t be so obtuse..."
5,azdk7v,t2_qz6x5ex,many_mean_comments,"SHP. I would go NTA *if* the reasons were the ones you stated, but >now she thinks I got some crossdressing or panty fetish **which I don't** >i did the same thing to my sister last month Really makes it hard to believe it"
5,ay847b,t2_21ma90y0,StarfruitCactus,"NTA, You already sound like a very considerate person, and it's absolutely fair to expect him to do his share of the housework. It actually might help nudge him out of the slump a bit - getting the house clean can feel like an accomplishment/be fresh-start inspiring in my experience! Good luck :) "
5,a0j1is,t2_761uu,Mcsmack,"NTA. If the bride says it's okay, then it's okay. Slacks, a dress shirt, and a tie is perfectly fine for a wedding. Trust me, everyone at that wedding has much more important things to worry about than what the SO of a bridesmaid is wearing. "
5,a52hhj,t2_1121vp,scottydog503333,"NTA but you definitely need to seek therapy and mental health help, and to everyone actually encouraging OP to divorce her husband. over harmless water and shoes. because ""he doesn't respect your mental illness"" Naw that's not cool, you need to respect it too and seek help to better yourself as well "
5,a52hhj,t2_15vx9y,impressivepineapple,"Others have said it, but NTA. If it was a laundry emergency, why didn’t he just go down there with shoes to do the laundry, and leave those shoes at the basement door as to not track around nasty pee water all over the house? I don’t have OCD and I’d be pissed as hell and maybe have left too. I can’t imagine how much worse it is with the OCD as well. "
5,a52hhj,t2_118x3u,Strautske,"YTA, It sounds like he was immature but not worthy of asshole status You started the fight and when he didn't want to deescalate the situation you both decided to keep adding fuel to the fire. From how you talk about him (in post/ in replies) your relationship is great a large majority of the time. This just happened to be a bad day and even the best relationships have bad days. Then you went nuclear, packed a night bag on an 8 year relationship, over water on the floor. Go home and apologize, he will do the same (hopefully), and everything will be ok"
5,ah0a9o,t2_994jo,thiscouldbemassive,"YTA for treating her badly. You sound very young. Adults in relationships have sex. Your parents did, and now your dad and his girlfriend are. One day you might have sex, too. There's nothing gross about it -- it's part of a healthy relationship. They aren't shoving it in your face. You are going into their room and poking about. So you need to respect their privacy instead of acting like they don't have a right to have a sexual relationship because you exist."
5,ah0a9o,t2_1pclp81m,bagelwithclocks,"YTA. your dad is an adult and is making adult choices. Nothing you have said here is assholish behavior from your dad or his girlfriend. You have made a lot of judgmental comments with no justification. One year is a perfectly ok amount of time to move on from a relationship. People are allowed to have lingerie. Lube on the night stand was in their room, not out in the open. &#x200B; It does sound like you are having trouble processing your parents divorce. Parents divorcing is extremely hard on their kids, and parents should expect some level of assholishness from their kids. You shouldn't be expected to like or treat anyone new as a parent, especially soon after your parents have divorced. It doesn't sound like your dad is asking you to do so though, just to give her a chance."
5,ah0a9o,t2_jcl1v,skyrix03,YTA. Why would your dad need to hide that hes having sex? Why do you care what kind of underwear this new lady wears? Seems to me like you're just looking for excuses to be mad. If your parents couldn't be happy together they deserve to find happiness elsewhere. Its none of your business who they're with unless they're being measurably hurt by their partner.
5,ah0a9o,t2_ohxx8,VivaVeronica,"YTA, but it's understandable to be uncomfortable. How long do you think is the ""right"" amount of time to wait after a divorce? Before you answer, remember to add in all the pre-divorce time he spent miserable. Maybe you also shouldn't root through your dads night table and hamper? Sexy underwear is a thing one wears to show off for a new boyfriend. It's good you're going to talk with him. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask him to put away his lube haha."
5,ah0a9o,t2_1m0abdfm,LivingAtAltitude,NTA No one likes to think of their parent as a sexual person. I'd imagine it's even more cringe when it's with a new partner. It's good that she's kind to you and makes your dad happy.
5,aeqibd,t2_2bxqxreo,hmmwill,"YTA Or at least very clingy. You aren't even together just talking, no harm in her talking to someone else unless your agreed to be exclusive. Plans to date isn't dating so unless you agreed to be exclusive it seems a little over the top to get angry"
5,ag4os8,t2_1k6f1oc6,amanda-11,"NTA-If you are always the one sleeping on the couch or floor and paying the same as everyone else. You should either ask for it to either be a rotating thing (this year u/Quria sleeps on sleeps on the couch, next year the single girls sleep on the couch, the next year couple 1 sleeps on the couch, etc.) if you are all paying the same amount or ask to only pay $50-100 bucks since you are aren't going to be getting a bed when everyone else is. Also why are the couples not paying their fair share? They way I see it everyone should pay $XXX, so the couples in the group need to pay $2XXX (ex: everyone pays $160, so the couples pay $320)."
5,b9qtbv,t2_20ujfgcr,itsstilltoospicy,"NTA your brother is an asshole. You do have a chance now to be the bigger person and help though, especially since you know first hand how dark things can get. It might also be an opportunity to rekindle the relationship if she was feeding him lies about you, although I wouldn’t go in expecting this. You’d be a saint if you did help but you also wouldn’t be an asshole if you decide not to. It’s your decision and either way you’re not wrong."
5,b9qtbv,t2_9u7th,zoeyversustheraccoon,NTA but I wouldn't do anything that permanently destroys the relationship. People can change and he's your only family. Don't do anything you may regret later. Doesn't mean you have to start a super close relationship with him right away but you could just acknowledge the apology and keep living your life. He is apologizing after all. 
5,b9qtbv,t2_nd7mj,TheBoyJude,"NTA, he made his bed not one, not twice but three times if not more. Sucks for him, but just because you're brothers doesn't mean you need to be there for him no matter what."
5,b9qtbv,t2_wfbqi,NebulaSlayer,"NTA, it’s understandable that you are/were hurt. But I think if you find a place in your heart to move on and forgive him, you’ll be better off. Maybe he was in an borderline abusive relationship (from the very little you told, her trying to break you 2 apart and manipulating him to believe she wasn’t cheating, it seems that she is not a good person in the very least) and it’s hard to see reality when you’re in this position. This is not an advice sub, I know, but these are my 2 cents. All the best to you, anyway."
5,b9qtbv,t2_r8ih0pb,ochu_,"NTA - what a hypocrite of a brother you have. If I were in your shoes I'd probably still help him though, if nothing else than as a chance to express how he'd hurt you and to show that you aren't the same as him."
5,b9qtbv,t2_p026x,RussianEarlGrey,"NTA. This could be an opportunity to reconcile with your brother and maybe, with time, go back to having the close relationship you once had. But only if you want to. It might be that you feel like the relationship is truly dead and there is nothing there to rekindle. In that case, as sad as it might be, move on and ignore him. He only has himself to blame. You decide what you want to do. Either way, NTA in my opinion."
5,b9qtbv,t2_m7wyh,PEPSICOLA123456,Nta - but there’s no stronger bond than two brothers. I think you should help him out as it’s like an act of forgiveness and will hopefully remove the sourness between you guys. 
5,b9qtbv,t2_ftp1v,channy64,"I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. NTA The roles are literally reversed now. You two are the only family you guys have, and yet he couldn't help you in your time of need. Why should you help him now? Let him deal with it on his own, just like you had to."
5,b9qtbv,t2_6wy2n,XenoRyet,"NTA technically, I guess. You'd be within reasonable behavior to just move on. That said, I'd think about whether or not you want to repair the relationship with your brother. Because if you do, now is the time, and this is how you do it. He's in a spot where he can maybe realize the problems with how he's acted in the past, and you're in a spot to show him that family can be there for you even if you've fucked up. You by no means are obligated to take that path, but you should do some thinking on whether or not you want to."
5,b9qtbv,t2_3as1877c,DM-Mormon-Underwear,"NTA one way or another, personally I wouldn't bother with him, especially with your wife being against it. What wasn't clear is whether he is actually asking you for anything? Sounded like all he did was give an update and apologized. You could accept/not accept or ghost him, but I definitely wouldn't be offering him anything in terms of emotional/financial support."
5,b9qtbv,t2_33fae6dv,hunt3rhunt,"NTA, and i believe its a sound judgement too. If you get involved, it will be messier. You will just be another bullet in the cheating wife's clip. Let him sort it out. Refuse any future invitation cuz you can probably draw from experience how fked up a divorce can be. "
5,b9qtbv,t2_17f80q,hallun123,"NTA & INFO: what kind of support is he asking for? If you want to have a relationship with him you could be the bigger man and support him emotionally, but I wouldn't support him financially. But I would also say your under no obligation to support him either. If he actually cares at all about you he'll take the emotional support and friendship and it might be a good opportunity to rekindle a relationship. "
5,b9qtbv,t2_1642om,Cassereddit,"NTA, but family should stick together as long as possible imo. It's your chance to be the bigger man and mend your relationship if you are ready to move on from the past. But it's totally understandable if you don't anything to do with him anymore. He was a blind fool but in the end, he still is your brother"
5,b9qtbv,t2_b0qny,guitarguywh89,"NTA but consider that most of what hurt you likely came from his now ex wife. This is an opportunity for you to show how much of a bigger person you are. You don't owe him shit, but if you do help I would expect him to be even more grateful"
5,b9qtbv,t2_1x3ds49z,24Cones,"NTA. Although he wronged you long ago, and you’re not the asshole for not helping him, I believe it would be a chance to bond with your brother if you decide you DO want to help him. Nothing wrong with NOT helping him through this, but if you gave any emotional support I feel like you could mend some of your relationship and in general being the “bigger person” may help you feel good after it’s all done "
5,b9qtbv,t2_cvt5i,killer_orange_2,"NTA. Look let me ask you this question, what do you want from this situation. Do you want your brother to hurt like you did when he rejected you or do you want closure. He was wrong in the past and is now asking for help. Being blood does not mean you have to stay in a toxic relationship. However that also doesn't mean you can't repair the relationship if it will help you heal. This does not mean doing everything for him, but rather being supportive of him during the struggle. Do what is going to help you heal from your divorce and him being a shithead. I would also remember your wife got to see what he did to you and is hurt by that too. Talk through your decision with her, but do it in a way where it is not about hurting him for hurting you, but what helps both of you heal. "
5,b9qtbv,t2_2lha25t3,tbonelarouge,NTA- but he is you're brother and if it was me I would probably forgive him and help him out as best as I could. An eye for an eye type thing in this situation could lead to losing someone close to you and you're only real family forever.
5,b9qtbv,t2_2cjzuucf,fromonegeektoanother,"NTA at all. I totally understand not wanting anything to do with him. Still, he is your only family. If it were me, it would be a LONG talk (face to face if possible) about everything that had happened. I wouldn't be able to just get over it (I am not that kind of a person), so that talk is essential. Based off of that would determine if I help him. Good luck! "
5,b9qtbv,t2_2fkssncp,timmyturnerdiedtoday,"NTA. I mean if you don’t want to you wouldn’t technically be an asshole. But knowing how hard your divorce was and how it feels like shit not having him there, wouldn’t you want to mend your relationship considering it’s only you two? At some point or even now you’ll look back and think about your relationship with your brother and think what happened? The wife was obviously poisoning him - and probably loved her a lot for that kind of shit to take affect deeply. And now he’s hurting. But it’s your choice, if you want to salvage your relationship with you brother, you hash out your issues with each other and start anew. Don’t bury anything. Note he said he’s sorry he didn’t believe you. Meaning he’s admitted his wrong, and her wrong. There is hope for you and your brother to be civil and close again. Or you can just move on. But some day you may regret it. Maybe. "
5,b9qtbv,t2_3fjp13yt,Nobody94-,YTA He’s your only family. You don’t have to stoop to his level and even you admitted it was his crazy bitch wife trying to turn him against you.. I have a little brother and even if he did me this way I wouldn’t hesitate if he needed help. 
5,b9qtbv,t2_k1le5,Rambo1stBlood,"YTA. You were both really young adults the first time around. It was immature (or perhaps, understandable because most people aren't fully mature at the ages you were.). Times have changed though....You are both adults. By doing the same thing he did at that young age, you are just acting like a kid about it....but this time its not understandable because you are not a young adult anymore. He said you were right about everything...do you really need more than that? You have a chance here to strengthen the relationship with the only family you have - Don't fuck it up. "
5,b9qtbv,t2_25ddy3zw,IIDoggs,"NTA YES, your brother fucked up big time dropped the ball and turned his back. BUT, he needs your help I get the whole let him burn, it just seems too cold a dish to serve in this case. Life gave you guys a second chance to be close again, forgive and take it. I wouldn't just jump in with both feet, but don't turn your back on him either. Hindsight, if he he helped you back then, you may not be married or as close to the current wife. Something positive came out of it. Good luck to both you guys. "
5,b9qtbv,t2_2u8931er,misucaroline,"Yes you wbta if you did this and I’ll explain. It sounds like your brother has just had the veil lifted from his eyes. He was being gas lighted and was probably in a very emotionally and mentally abusive relationship. When one is in that type of relationships, the abuser does everything in their power to isolate their spouse from their family. Your brother hurt you. No one is denying that. But you are a better person. Someone above said to be who you are, not who he was. Who he was in the past was a person in a terribly abusive relationship. But now you have the opportunity to get your brother back and rebuild a relationship with him that can be the strong lifelong bond you both deserve. Think about it. "
5,b9qtbv,t2_3hxi22er,NoGoodDeed762,"YTA, A bit of a harsh judgement on my part, but that IS your Brother, right? Cut the crap out of the math, and ""help a brother out"". I was in a similar situation, not long ago. I help my BROTHER out whenever I can. He returns the favor, likewise. That is the deal. Period. Barring attempts on your life, or something else that crazy, don't let other people create drama between the two of you. Don't let your relationship turn into bad country music. Be the bigger man, and he will follow your lead."
5,b9qtbv,t2_6yuaf,Viperbunny,"YTA. Drunk texting is not irrelevant. You told your brother and he made a decision. You actively crossed a boundry he clearly set. He was the one who had something to lose and he did lose. You both have a lot of growing up to do and so does your wife. She doesn't get to decide what you do. Whether you help him or not, you have been behaving lilike an ass."
5,an8pb2,t2_30xh2oil,High_Frequency_Tribe,"YTA This seems like something that's has like 10 solutions I can think of right off the top of my head, and they all have the same thing in common of just being an adult "
5,an8pb2,t2_2tm2gxjx,Ann-von-Beaverhausen,"YTA. But not a mega asshole as you’re trying to solve the problem. Honestly I would probably bring my own towel - who knows how clean they get theirs. Or grab a roll of paper towel out of the change room. Or wear wrist bands and a headband ‘70s style. You should actually just do that anyway, because that would be awesome."
5,b3s2dk,t2_34fbpsyi,DRCsyntax,"NTA - She's completely out of fucking line. People like this infuriate me beyond belief. It's a damn flag, an inanimate object, get the hell past it. &#x200B; I'm black/mexican in Texas and hate seeing news reports about ""Confederate monument being removed from blah blah"" Why?! What the fuck for? So, we're just going to ignore the Civil War occurred? We're going to hide it? Why? &#x200B; Anyway, not trying to derail, I'm just tired of people riding on the curtails of their ancestors, who would more likely want them to remember that kind thing instead of try to damn and curse it. (Because it's a clear sign of how far we've come as a people....not just a reminder of how low we were.)"
5,b3s2dk,t2_7ntysqp,jonslegos,"NTA. Regardless of my opinion of the confederates and the history of the civil war, (it's not all black and white, but yes the confederates did some bad things.) she destroyed private property. Theres no way you're an asshole. I will say one thing though, not all blacks were enslaved. Her ancestors may not have been enslaved blacks, and I'm not gonna make assumptions, but I'm willing to bet she didn't do any research about her ancestry to confirm her claim."
5,a86kbb,t2_2k8oi3ol,just_another_casual,NTA. Your mom bash on your dream and say that she doesn’t care about your dreams? No mother should ever say that to their child. Actually. No parents should ever say that to their child. You take your time when you want to accept it. I fully understand why you’re upset. It would kill me hearing that.
5,b1vqef,t2_fdkkf,thedup,"NTA, you kissed him because you thought he was cute, that doesn't mean you're leading him on, it means you in the moment maybe changed your mind. Leading him on has to be a conscious decision to be an asshole move lol. After the date are you still sure you don't want to be with him? If that's clear, fair enough, at least he got a nice cheek kiss out of it lol Z sucks though, what a creep"
5,b37qkk,t2_icgzt,LordJiraiya,"NTA, you let your preferences be known far in advance and you found a compromise so that you both can enjoy things together (the borderline shows). She already knew that you wouldn't want to see that specific genre of film but she asked you anyway, and then is upset for you asking so you would know that you don't want to go? This makes no sense to me, she should go see it with someone else or by herself if she wants to go that bad."
5,a82jrn,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,"NAH. No one buys the cow when they’re getting the milk for free. Why would he? He’s getting precisely what he wants, on demand and with zero commitment. So here’s the more important piece...what to do about it. He’s using you and has no reason to stop and no intention of stopping. The idea that if you stick around, maybe he will come around, is unlikely to pan out. It might. He’d have to catch feelings. I wouldn’t bet on it. The other strategy is the one I would go with. Cut him off and go no contact. I wouldn’t stay friends. If you do, he’s likely to tell you what you want to hear, and as soon as he gets back in your pants he’ll revert right back to where he is right now. Going no contact would really be for you. It will help you break away and learn to fly on your own again. Its better that you end it. Secondary to that, he may miss you and be more open to a real relationship. He may not, and go searching for another girl similar to you that he can use with no strings. Either way, you regain your independence. I don’t think this is going to end well with the relationship in its current state, so you’ve really got nothing to lose. "
5,aejroo,t2_1ctyfubn,JivyNme,"NTA: but you can still be supportive to your gf, being sick sucks on many levels. Could you suggest a second trip some other time so she doesn’t feel like she’s missing out completely?"
5,aejroo,t2_17xdk4gq,cityzombie,"NTA, but there are probably other sick people there too unfortunately, can't really avoid it unless you live in a bubble. Maybe she could wear a medical mask in the car with you guys? It's not wrong to want to protect your mom though! Totally understandable. "
5,a1rpn7,t2_143th2,viewfromtheclouds,"NTA, but there’s some things in life that aren’t fair, and are no one’s fault. You can get angry, but that doesn’t mean others need to change their reality to accommodate your anger. I understand your frustration though, just make sure you don’t channel it thinking someone isn’t making your life fair. Sometimes it rains."
5,aru0cj,t2_38uvxif3,SaddensMe,"NTA You are an adult. You can decide whether or not to open up to your parents. The fact he was so inconsiderate and told you he “made no promises” when you told him not to tell your mother shows that he shouldn’t have the right to listen to you or the right that you gave him by opening up to him. I understand if you feel bad for not giving him the chance to help you, but if he isn’t considerate of your feelings and how important it is that you trust him enough to open up to him, then he doesn’t have that right to know anything about your life at all. Even though he is your own father. "
5,adrfp7,t2_2osjz7z6,SharpShel,"YTA. Here’s a parenting truth: we love our kids to the ends of the earth, but yes...our kids annoy the shit out of us sometimes. Especially teenagers (based on the phone charger argument, I’m assuming that’s the age range of you and your sister.) Had you been at home, dad would have told you guys to go upstairs, so he didn’t have to listen to your nonsense arguing. But you’re in a motel room. Arguing loudly. He wanted peace and quiet. He put you outside for 1-2 minutes so you’d knock it off, and you didn’t. Let your sister charge her phone, then you charge yours. It won’t be the worst thing ever, I promise ;)"
5,9wi9zo,t2_2g6sbd2e,madzizou,"NTA, of course. You don’t need to have boyfriends/girlfriends if you don’t want them. Who you date is your decision, and being choosy with your partners is better than settling for anyone who asks you. Plus, you’re only 19. You have years yet to start thinking about that sort of thing. "
5,apxa03,t2_175qe7,Tython199,"YTA You needed to tell her, you just picked a very asshole manner to do it in. Even if everyone knows, doing it in a group setting was not the way to do it. Everything is more devastating in a group. If she didn't know or had just grown used to it, she likely doesn't think the other people there knew as no one said anything to her. You called her out on it in front of who whole group. If you tell her one on one and let her down easy on it, you're not the asshole. Doing it in a group makes it much more hard on her and you much more of an asshole. "
5,apxa03,t2_qouiv,TouchMyAwesomeButt,"YTA for not going about it delicately. No one likes hearing that they smell, even less that they smell like cat pee. You should've taken her aside, told her you didn't want to hurt her feelings. But if she really wanted to know the truth, her body odor isn't very pleasant. "
5,apxa03,t2_6rj74,enna12,"NTA You weren't saying it to be mean. You were asked a question and answered honestly. Knowing that very well may have helped her to do something about her smell. I've always felt that if I smelled (not like a I haven't showered in three days and know I stink, but a I stink all the time and have no idea), I'd want someone to tell me."
5,arm0yc,t2_ycxwx,viajar-es-vivir,"NTA at all. If you say you don't want a drink and he buys one for you and insists you drink it, that was completely his decision and he should have to pay for it regardless. Stand your ground and don't drink if you don't want to, especially if it agitates your anxiety. It sounds like your friend is going through a really tough situation and if there's anyway he can get some counseling, I think that would go a long way to helping him (and you)."
5,b19cac,t2_22rvvykj,rosy--dead,"INFO - was it the middle of the day or at night? Either way, NTA. Keep managing your PTSD. It's not an excuse to freak out at people, but you know that. Also littering is bad. Honestly this post kinda makes me mad on your behalf. I don't want people I don't know touching my car. I don't want to deal with random flyers for shit I don't care about. Plus - the way he started walking toward you again and was staring at you seems intensely creepy to me. edit: also, are you a woman? younger? It shouldn't matter, but I think it does. I'm a 21 year old woman and if something like this happened to me I would be really freaked out. I don't know if I'd react the same way but I think feeling scared/vulnerable justifies your reaction a little more."

5,a43d81,t2_pws4opb,paintedpinecone,"NTA - You have gone above and beyond for your mother and the dog. It doesn’t seem like she wants the dog back at all (& even if she did, she already proved she can’t take good care of him), so rehoming him would be the best thing for him. Thanks for sticking up for the dog & getting him healthy! "
5,a43d81,t2_qrfkb,cautionjaniebites,"NTA If you choose to rehome him please look for breed specific rescues to help you. Pounds suck as do most shelters and just no to Craigslist. If you like him though, maybe things could be easier once you move And you can try to keep him? "
5,ab3pkd,t2_15t9j1,Kontorted,"You *think* he doesn't like it. Have you thought to ask him directly? Additionally, is it really so hard to just use someone's name?

5,aobql4,t2_h24nvv,moe-kalong,"NTA I agree with everyone that tells you to leave this punk, if not at least talk to him and try to put him to reason but I'm afraid he will be very hard to change (himself) because after all he only can change himself if he wants to.

5,axfrqy,t2_3bj41thw,MegaFaggotJR,"YTA You asked, he said no and then you pestered him. You aren't entitled to a spot you wanted just because you didn't have the foresight to book ahead of time.

5,axfrqy,t2_2b56o8g8,_fuck_this_shit__,"YTA. Not because you asked the first time, but because you didn’t take no for an answer and asked again. The middle seat isn’t comfortable for anyone, regardless of height. He booked his seat, and he has no obligation to trade with you because you’re tall. I understand flying is uncomfortable for tall people (husband is 6’5, I’ve heard all about it many times) but if someone says no to switching with you then you need to accept it and move on. "
5,axfrqy,t2_rz5fj66,Kecir,"YTA. He paid for the seat, told you no and you should have dropped it. Your unnecessary need to go on and on about how short he was in your post makes me wonder if he even really freaked out so quick or if you kept pestering him and that was when he snapped at you. You act like you are 7 ft 5 or something."

Next time, book the seat you want. Also are you a troll or what? This can't be real. No one could be this entitled. "

Maybe have a long discussion and ask if she considers other gay people and how they sometimes would marry people of the opposite sex to hide it etc. and how that doesn’t make them bi? If she can’t respect that and it’s something important to you to identify with then she might not be mature enough for you and clearly doesn’t respect you feelings on it. Also her comment on going full gay or whatever it was is very immature. I’m bi and don’t consider myself straight when dating men and lesbian when dating women. Still bi.

YTA for the way you're flaunting their rules and disrespecting them while they are doing you a favor by letting you stay there.

On the other hand, I think talking about a show *during* the show can be very entertaining and enlightening. **Pause the show.** I do this with my girlfriend, because she sometimes likes to comment about or discuss what's happening. If it's not a mini-conversation that can be concluded in 5 seconds, I pause it. Sometimes it's really great to have a back-and-forth about what's going on for a minute or two, and then continue. It seems like this is the best compromise for both of you. You don't want to miss the movie, and it seems she's incapable of keeping quiet. "

You do not have yelling fights about it bc it’s not really any of your business who she spends her time talking to(if she’s complaining about it that’s different, but you don’t say that). It sounds like you’re upset she was around you 24/7 anymore and she’s not responsible for your emotional well being either.

I'm a therapist and 1) this guy sounds like a bit of a dick and 2) you can stop seeing your therapist at any time for any reason if you stop feeling comfortable or don't feel like you are getting anything out of your sessions.

Yes, you have an antisocial personality disorder, but an explanation is not an excuse and it's certainly not a reason for other people to have to put up with a bad attitude or bad behaviour. Even in your post, you're focused on your success and how your siblings are less successful. Most people couldn't give a fuck about that shit. You even refer to people asking about your New Years as ""fuck heads"" even though by your own admission they didn't know you weren't there. "
5,apr7jh,t2_1wrrox4l,CrippledAstronaut,"YTA, there was no reason to tell her that and you knew it would hurt her obviously because you tried to not tell her. It would be one thing if her best friend had feelings for you as well and you two wanted a relationship. But that’s not the case. "

Her negligence in not doing the task has now cost you both in time, and money. Her expectations of being paid is pretty silly, in my opinion. You don't do what is agreed upon, you don't get paid.

Our regular house sitter is in her 60s and does a flawless job."

It’s your job to be worried, and it sounds like you’re not one to yell much at all if you’re even posting this. Just don’t yell - it’s the quickest way to chase your kid away.

5,acx62a,t2_1oq0ls5p,pukui7,"YTA There was no need to yell at your daughter. Do you really want her thinking that's normal appropriate male behavior? She's an hour late. Don't let that slide, if it's such a big deal to you. But don't be an ass about it.

5,acx62a,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"YTA. But only a little. You were worried and scared. Something could have happened to her and when someone who is responsible goes dark and stops replying? It's scary. Get her a portable charger/power pack. Tell her to keep it fully charged and carry it with her in her bag. That way if her phone gets low on battery, she can plug it in. This was a mistake on her part, but she's clearly a very responsible teenager and keeping her on groundation when she already has so much responsibility isn't fair at all. Cut her a break, have a serious conversation about WHY you yelled at her, ad let it go."

5,acx62a,t2_npcu11l,mathxjunkii,"Nah you’re fine. You’re NTA. But she needs to understand that even adults call people they live with if they’re going to be late. If my boyfriend told me he’d be home at 10, and it got to be 11 and he didn’t show up and wasn’t answering the phone id be soooo anxious. I don’t care if he’s late, or doing something with his friends, but tell me if you’re going to be later than you said so that I don’t think you died. In reality, she’s a 16 year old girl, and as a girl who has been 16, 17, 18, etc.... I remember what I was doing when I “lost track of time”. But with the way you’ve described your daughter, she’s *fine*, even if she has started “losing track of time”. I wouldn’t worry about that if I were you. (But it definitely explains the lack of phone call). I would say, for now, tell her she has to text you if she’s going to be later than she’s suppose to be. Promise not to ask questions or request a phone call, but tell her you need a text saying “I’m going to be late”. And tell her it can’t be after 11. If she needs to set an alarm for 9:45 on her phone to remind her - do it. (Or if she has a Fitbit, she can set a silent alarm that will just vibrate on her wrist, and remind her to text you. That way, none of her friends will ask about it and she won’t feel embarrassed that she has to call her dad). It’s just a learning curve for both of you. You’re fine. "

I was NAH and this was a misunderstanding, but its this part which is kinda, you're shifting blame onto him on a thought he ""might"" have taken advantage of the situation. > He should have left. He should have called. He should have texted. He should have asked. We have 2 kids under 3 yrs old so sex is... Scarce. I feel like he didnt call me because secretly he wanted the massage This sounds a lot more like he was totally blindsided by the ""gift"" but accepted it because you set it up for him. If he really wanted to deceive or take advantage of the situation, he really wouldnt come out of the situation and immediately jeopardize his relationship by telling you. This is like filming a crime you are committing. Now if you think your husband is an absolute idiot who couldnt get away with a crime or have more INFO on his reaction, I might be NAH or NTA."
5,arun8w,t2_doqtb,MadoogsL,"YTA While I see this is uncomfortable for you, it doesn't sound like your husband intended to do anything shady. He simply received the massage you bought him, thinking it was what you meant to get. He was straightforward and told you everything that happened. Don't punish him for this. You said it yourself you are insecure and upset about him possibly wanting something that would make you upset. Talk to him instead of letting your mind go crazy about it. He came to you for sex after, remember, didn't just ""relieve himself"" during the massage."
5,arun8w,t2_5oe85,Jantra,"YTA, but for a reason I'm not sure I see anyone else bringing up. Your husband told you what happened, didn't relieve himself, and came home to you.

He knows you sent him there, paid for it, and intended him to get it. He had no idea you didn't know the whole of it. You did put him in that awkward situation that he wouldn't have otherwise gotten tino. I'd suggest you could sit down and admit you didn't really know what it was, and in the future, you would have liked him to say no and come home, but you're not mad with how he handled the situation. (Even if you are, but you should be mad at yourself for not knowing what you signed him up for.) Thank him for coming home and telling you the truth. You need to let this go."
5,arun8w,t2_14s8j7,MrBoo843,"YTA. You sent him there. You paid for the ""Full Body Massage"". You told him to go get the massage. You said yourself there might have been a slim chance this kind of massage was your intention. He even felt uncomfortable and told you so upon arriving. He did not leave, he thought this was your gift. He did not text or call, because he thought this is what you wanted. Sex being scarce would make me think this was your intention even more if I were him. Just own up to this stupid fuck up and both have a laugh at how ridiculous this situation is."
5,arun8w,t2_1ufgz7nx,kapbear,"Maybe you should get actual advice and not just getting judged on who's the asshole because everything is not black and white. But I guess YTA because you can't take it out of him. You and your husband should be on the same side of this. He barely got touched. There's a huge difference between making him come, stroking him, giving him a blowjob and grazing his dick. She touched his back, his arms, his neck and it felt great but for some reason the skin on his dick is the problem? He didn't even come. Your husband told you everything and it's not his fault. Maybe it's weird, maybe you don't like it but move on. It was a mistake. This is so not a big deal. He's your husband, your dick, you love him, and you make him come. It was a mistake. He didn't cheat on you. You have to shrug and move past this. "
5,arun8w,t2_ridn7,Stinkehund1,"YTA. You booked the massage and made a mistake. Your husband had no way of knowing that and probably thought of it as a nice gift, especially if what you say about your polyamorous tendencies is true. Sounds very much like there is a lot more than just ""slim potential"" for you to sign him up for something like this. And now you're guilting and punishing him about something *you* misunderstood. He didn't cheat on you. He didn't do anything with that masseuse, didn't even ""relieve"" himself there. He did nothing wrong here and you're behaving like a crazy person."
5,9x905y,t2_1xra82le,TitaniumHymen,"YNTA but you need to tell her.

Edit: Though this may not be as important of an issue... they may resent you for not letting them use electronics. I’m not saying they will, but they certainly could. I would have absolutely resented my mother for not letting me play. "
5,arooyg,t2_2h00ilpl,heypeoplasatansback,"Sorry, but YTA. Don’t get me wrong, I do understand that you might want to raise them with no addiction to technology. But dear, times have changed. As adults - we need to understand that and accept that so we can prepare younger ones for changes. It’s just simple as that. Imagine your kids after they go to college. They will use their phones constantly just to keep up after all those years. But I really understand you and your good intentions! :)"
5,arooyg,t2_1ykis8bq,chriscus,"YTA , 16 is way too old for that ! 14 and 13 is too ! Im 18 and i needed electronics all through high school for research and communication for school related things - also it’s for enjoyment , your kids do a lot at school they should be able to come home and once homework is done - just relax "
5,arooyg,t2_p85qy5r,Attentionme,YTA. Denying you kids the internet won't make their childhood more like yours. It will still be a childhood in 2019 but they won't understand the culture they're growing up in. They won't be more outdoorsy or less addicted to technology they'll just be lonely and excluded.
5,b14bpm,t2_1gh9ah7,YourFriendlySpidy,"Yta Was it a dick move to ghost you, yes. She didn't owe you an explanation as to why, but she did at least owe you a text cancelling. Was saying that her ghosting you meant she deserved to be abused absolutely disgusting of you, yes. Yta by a mile here"
5,b14bpm,t2_ccasgn,Wednesday_Atoms,"YTA. Most people (*not just men*) who regularly use online dating get ghosted at one point or another. You've called this woman a sociopath, called her behavior sickening, and said some pretty sexist things in your replies about women and what your owed. (Yes, I saw your reply that the owed card doesn't work here *eye roll*). You're dramatically exaggerating the extent to which you were hurt and downplaying her own victimization in order to... What? Get sympathy? Justify your shitty behavior? Let it go. "
5,b06yaj,t2_33dydi6h,sasha_bo,"NAH. Sometimes people just aren't sexually compatible. Nothing wrong with that but from the sounds of it, I don't think this is something that is going to be an easy fix (or can/should be fixed at all TBH). ""I told her that sex with her makes me want to bang my head against the wall"" This was uncalled for. &#x200B; Edit: Changed from NTA to NAH."
5,b06yaj,t2_1e2krssr,bigrottentuna,"YTA. You get to be frustrated and she gets to be uninterested. But you seem very stuck in your own head. You don’t mention ever asking her what turns her on. You don’t mention performing oral on her. You blame her for her lack of interest and lash out at her instead of trying to work it out together. You sound like a boring, self-interested lover. I can see why she isn’t excited to have sex with you."
5,b6yt93,t2_ba06p,FrankGoreStoleMyBike,"God I can't wait until spring break is over and all the kids go away. YTA. Don't scream at people. Especially people who you care about. If you wouldn't do it to a random person on the street, or your fragile grandma, why would you do it to your mom? Her house, her rules. Sucks, but thems the breaks. If you want privacy, speak with respectfully, ideally outside of the situation, and explain you would like some privacy. If that doesn't work, then you have around 2 years to put up with it and you can move out."
5,b6yt93,t2_5y57q,dgvertz,"NTA But if I may, I'd like to proselytize a bit, as I don't think your mom is completely shitty here. Your mom may be overprotective or whatever, but being ""around 15"" years old, I'm inclined to say you don't get privacy in the same way you might hope. Your mom is checking to make sure you're not doing drugs or drinking alcohol. Is she doing that in a proper, efficient, or kind way? No. Obviously. But that's what she's doing. Probably some other kid in your year at school, or in a neighboring town, or the kid of one of your mom's friends recently got caught with drugs and she's scared shitless about you doing the same thing. Is she right? No. Is she an asshole? Yeah probably. But you kind of have to eat it until you move out. Talk to her about it. Be the bigger person, even though you shouldn't HAVE to be the bigger person. Don't get frustrated, don't lose your temper about it. You'll earn yourself more trust if you're forgiving and thoughtful about this. "
5,b1tc1q,t2_365hrcbx,edgyusername123,"YTA There are some things you just don’t say. What good will come from saying this? She won’t hang off you calling her beautiful, she’s going to hang off you saying you’ve lost attraction for her. This will likely make her more insecure, possibly depressed, and won’t help or encourage her to lose weight. Thinking this doesn’t make you an ass hole, saying it does. She needs your encouragement and support, not affirmation on her insecurities. "
5,ad3esd,t2_24wdn0if,AlluringAllura,"YTA. If this wasn't r/AmItheAsshole, I would not call you an asshole. I would phrase it more like, ""Not being as good a person you could be."" Or how about, ""Not behaving in a way Mr. Rodgers believes you can."" Sure, you didn't do it on purpose. But now that you know what happened, it's kind of taking advantage of a guy who is new at his job. Also guessing gamestop doesn't pay very well. Now he could get in trouble, but you have the power to stop it and are choosing not to, over a lousy 10 bucks. To me, it wouldn't be worth the guilt. If you were struggling at a new job and screwed up, imagine how greatful you would be for an honest customer that got you out of a jam. I mean, maybe gamespot will be easy on him for being new. I hope it turns out fine."
5,awwmsy,t2_wi862,kotominammy,"YTA, she's a grown adult who's making her own decisions. You don't get a say in what you want or don't want for her anymore, only she does. Not to mention imo your opinion is very rude and uncalled for. Step parents aren't just second fiddle to the child, it depends very much on the relationship between them and their blood & step parents. Besides, you have a weird focus on the kid when she is probably more interested in living with her partner -- why do you focus so much on not wanting her to ""come second"" to a child?"
5,awwmsy,t2_1i3q9nho,anthony_samuel,YTA. Seriously how.. Like.. What is your thought process here? YOU don't want her to be a step mom? Well sucks but it's her life. She's old enough. She's an adult woman. And she's not even saying she wants to be his mother or adopt him. She's moving in with the man she loves. You should be happy for her and support her! And if she decides to step up and be the boys mother; be even more happy for her and support her even more! 
5,awwmsy,t2_wqyn0,cernegiant,"YTA. It's her life, she's an adult and she's fully capable of making her own decessions. 23 is youngish to start a family, but only by a couple of years. The only thing you'll accomplish by telling her is driving her away."
5,awwmsy,t2_2215yimg,Spicymayogoddess,"YTA, she is an adult and this is a choice she is making. Pregnancy also isn't necessary to be a mother. Be supportive and just help her with resources (books and forums) because she is going into an almost step parent role soon and it can be hard. "
5,awwmsy,t2_10330o,evoLyllaeR,"YTA for a couple reasons. One, your child has said she doesn't want a pregnancy to have a child. Here you're ignoring that this way she gets to nurture without pregnancy in a way that's acceptable to everyone involved... Except you. Two, she is an adult. If it's the wrong choice, she gets the most benefit from making the mistake and learning about herself in the process. It's not your choice to make and you can't interfere in her life, or it isn't her life anymore. Three, did i miss it where she actually asked you? Just stay out of the way. "
5,awwmsy,t2_2m9rbi4g,Budguy1,"NTA. Going against the grain hard on this one. You are her father, doesn’t matter how old she is you’re allowed to give her your opinion. She doesn’t have to like it if she doesn’t want to. Edit: removed assumption, changed mother to father."
5,a6jc38,t2_2o4kpwpu,Megx3,NTA I was excited to finally find one where the person was an asshole but this isnt it. You are absolutely in the right. Honestly they probably knew what they were doing and knew that any person would give up a seat for a pregnant lady but I wouldnt have moved. screw that.
5,a6jc38,t2_4fxzq,Kinglink,NTA... But everyone who judged you on that ride who had a seat sucked. I believe you never have to give up your seat. They don't know your story so them trying to force you makes them suck but anyone saying you should give up your seat should have given up theirs instead. That's a pile of bullshit if you ask me... 
5,a6jc38,t2_kj4ho,SpiderRealm,"NTA. Both of them are bitches. The friend should have not taken the seat from her pregnant friend and she should have let her pregnant friend get her seat back. Their feet hurting has nothing to do with you. I'm willing to bet they do this all the time. Pregnant sits down, friend complains, pregnant gives seat to friend, pregnant complains, and pregnant gets a seat so now the both of them are sitting. Manipulative bitches. Sorry for the language."
5,a6jc38,t2_j1btm7b,Gilgamesh107,"man after reading that headline i came here rubbing my hands together ready to call you an asshole. but after reading this it just seems like they are fucking stupid, actually since that woman managed to shift the blame to you after taking her pregnant friend's seat she may not be so stupid. NTA either way"
5,a6jc38,t2_ttyby,FustianRiddle,"No. YTA. Unless you have a condition where you need to sit (pain, disability, etc...) you let the pregnant lady sit. Even if she didnt need it before. A pregnant person's comfort levels can change drastically in a moment. That being said the friend is also the asshole. And I'd argue the primary asshole, unless again she has a condition we are unaware of. But still YTA If not THE at least AN in this situation. "
5,ay31dy,t2_13jrqx,PeachyPesco,"YTA, but only a little. It's completely fair that she wants to go to this party alone, especially since she specified that this is more of a work related party. She's also invited you before, so you know she has no issue with you going. I think your real issue is that she doesn't initiate spending time together. You'd like her to plan a date, or be the one to ask to do things together instead of it being you all the time. I think this is fair, and you should being this issue up to her separate from this one. :)"
5,ay31dy,t2_ixcff0b,jackalnapesjudsey,"YTA Only for expecting to be invited to the parties every time. I think it’s reasonable for her to want to spend time socialising without you, it’s healthy even. But you do have legitimate reasons to be frustrated about not spending enough time together, I just don’t think this party is the answer to solving the issue. I think you need to talk to her and tell her your needs aren’t being met and try to work out a way to spend more time together. "
5,agao4z,t2_rmzlxp3,StragglingShadow,"NTA. You lashed out, sure, but considering the emotional toil she had just hit you with, totally not an asshole thing to do. Im no love expert, but I urge you to run. What she did is disgusting and is a testimony to how she is totally willing to betray your trust by lying about something so horrible."
5,b47k4y,t2_blb69qb,Anuri_DnD,"NTA It's your right to feel this way. In fact it shows you care and are a good friend. Ending the friendship would be a shame, but if it bothers you too much it's better then trying to mingle with her life. But at least talk to her first so she can understand why you refrain yourself. "
5,b47k4y,t2_37ul1n1p,Budsygus,"NTA Tell her exactly how you feel and let the cards fall where they may. She's kind of ruining her life for this guy who sounds legitimately worthless. She will definitely be upset and she might end the friendship, but let her know that you'll always be there for her emotionally if she ever decides to reach out. When this guy leaves her and disappears (*when,* not *if)* you'll have left open the lines of communication."
5,b47k4y,t2_b7os3l2,edgeofruin,YTA only because you can't change people and you can't fix stupid. Act happy and let her make her life choices. Stop buying her stuff also it's just enabling her. Sometimes you just gotta let people fuck up to learn. But as far as ending the relationship you aren't an asshole there. Ain't nobody got time for these shenanigans. 
5,b47k4y,t2_2qriuyxu,egjb,YTA. You don’t have to agree with or like all your friends actions but if you are really friends then she deserves your support especially in this situation. If she is being abused then he actions might reflect the abuse not what she really wants. Also some people don’t want a baby and try not to have one but then when they do get pregnant they love that child so it might make life harder and not be what’s best or what she wants but she loves that child 
5,b8qalq,t2_1stis7l,crazybunny19,"NTA - your mom should have already chosen you over them. You wouldn't be making her choose, they are, but mistreating you. Tell your mom what you've said here. She shouldn't expect you to go where you're not wanted and treated poorly. I would hope she'd work to change the hearts and minds of fellow church-goers, not expect you to put up with their toxic bullshit. "
5,aucrcn,t2_2z5ur1by,blackandwhitepaint,"YTA if you ""confront"" someone about doing... nothing in particular to you? Why not just make the effort to go see the more often? As you said, life happens, and to take it personally and get hurt about it makes it sound like you're kinda making their life all about you. Unless they went out of your way to do something malicious to you, I don't see why you would need to make a scene of it. Just visit them and call them and reach out. Be the change you want to see. "
5,aucrcn,t2_g923y,PFKMan23,"Based on what you said, NAH. Life happens, people get busy, or even drama happens that you're not a part of or at fault for. And yes it's odd, but that's life. If it was me, I'd just call them up (provided you have the type of relationship where it isn't out of place) and be like ""We used to see each other all the time. Is anything wrong?"" For what it's worth I don't think a confrontation is necessary."
5,aeuvkb,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,"NTA. A word of advice - don’t ever tell someone that something makes you insecure. They may not have even know that, but now you’ve planted the suggestion for them to play with your insecurity. Now, you could tell her “hey, I don’t want to hear that. It’s kind of rude. Do you want to hear intimate details from my sexual past?” Bottom line, the girl sounds like a bit of a psycho. It’s kind of common sense, whether you are a guy or a girl, that you got talk about that stuff like it’s no big deal. "
5,b6yesp,t2_2qeoqiwu,bladesmithereen,"NTA, but what you really need to do is cut them both out. If you don't include him he will retaliate on her. She is the one staying with him, nothing you can say is going to change that fact. You should divest yourself from the situation."
5,ar7pf6,t2_29r0cpc7,gaberocksall,"NTA, but when you say you’re gonna do something then do your best to do it, for at least a few minutes(when you are uncomfortable what feels like 5 minutes is actually 30 seconds). But, in the end, consent is consent, so you can *politely* say that it’s not working out, and that you tried."
5,ar7pf6,t2_283vsy4k,moonstone-stardust,"NTA &#x200B; Maybe look into some BDSM rules before you start trying stuff like this again, safe words and communication. It takes a lot of trust to get tied up and if you aren't comfortable there isn't anything wrong with that. I get why someone might be upset if they're in the mood, but everyone should be enthusiastic about what's going on and you shouldn't feel uncomfortable. &#x200B;"
5,b40xeo,t2_hk9qz,FiveHundredMilesHigh,"YTA sounds like it's just a misunderstanding - if he was honest that he thought it would be okay if you didn't suit up, I don't see what he did wrong. If you cared so much about matching I think you should have brought it up, it may simply not have crossed his mind. FWIW as someone who enjoys dressing up, I think wearing a suit really should be the default at a wedding, and were I in your position I don't think I'd make any assumptions otherwise about what someone would wear if they didn't say so."
5,addlha,t2_2iewqp9u,Muse_asvhedu,"NTA. Sounds like there was literally no way for you to pay the business taxes, and he shouldn’t have expected you to. He’s a grown ass man who can handle his own shit (from a grown ass woman who does the same). "
5,b3ujn6,t2_1f9ckm55,emkautlh,"YTA >She wouldn't respond to me at all, and continued to faintly hyperventalate/appear paralyzed Do you think in this moment she was thinking ""hmmm, I *could* answer my husband but I will choose to ignore him for awhile""? It's very likely she WAS paralyzed. Sleep paralysis is very common, and often someone can wake up, be unable to move, and hallucinate that a nightmare is happening literally in the room. Its terrifying, and you think you're the victim here. You owe her an apology. "
5,b3ujn6,t2_37vz4yt5,FemmeSapiens,"YTA But only because you don't know any better. Educate yourself, understand that it is a sleeping disorder and be more supportive. The fear from night terrors or/and sleep paralysis is so terrifying, that it is not uncommon for the person to be unresponsive until fully awake and aware it's just a dream. It is genuinely a very awful feeling. Read up on it and be kind in future."
5,b3ujn6,t2_z26mg,BigBlueDane,YTA - sleep paralysis is a real thing. I've woken up several times in the situation you just described with your girlfriend and she wasn't lucid. How can you be upset at someone for essentially being asleep trapped in a nightmare? 
5,b3ujn6,t2_34r0e6wb,MrsUWP,"INFO Does she have a history of night terrors or sleep paralysis? It's possible to ""wake up"" but not actually be awake just yet. If she deals with either, then 100% YTA because there are few ways to control either without medication. That said, I also wouldn't put it pass some people to do something like this as a ""test"". Crying wolf, so to speak, to see if you'd drop everything."
5,b3ujn6,t2_10330o,evoLyllaeR,"YTA although it's close to ESH. Nightmares and seizures happen like this... You couldn't tell which one. In her defense, the brain can paralyze the body during sleep, and it may have taken a while to snap out of it. In your defense, she scared the shit out of you and a lot of folks go from fear to anger. It's hardly ever a healthy way to react, but conditioned."
5,aqoc9q,t2_56x1n,sophaloph,"NTA. I myself wouldn't text Annie anything. I'd leave her alone, completely. No small talk when y'all hang out. Just crickets. If she ever says anything to anyone about why you've been ignoring her, simply tell her the truth. ""I feel like you don't like me and you always seem annoyed at me when I talk to you, so I just stopped talking to you."" The saying about stupid people also applies to shitty people. Never argue with them; they'll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience."
5,aqoc9q,t2_29hqpsx2,Lady_krolux,"NAH She clearly doesn't like you for whatever reason. Why complicate thongs by making it a confrontation. Tell her you'd rather she didn't address you in a dostespectful way and move on woth your life. You're going at this in the most dramatic way possible, when you could just not care about the person you don't particularly like."
5,aqoc9q,t2_xw5d1,gleaming-the-cubicle,"NTA Know who's an asshole and a bully? Annie. Personally, I would wait for the next time she acts out in front of the group and go in with something like: ""Look, I understand you feel bad about yourself Annie, but being rude to me won't help your self worth. I'm done pretending this behavior is okay. I don't want to be friends anymore. I will mind my business and you can do the same."" Don't get angry, just state. If you do it in front of other people, she can't lie about context. Let her freak out and cry or whatever. Just say ""see, this is exactly the kind of thing I meant"". "

5,b751z6,t2_ipu61y1,Jimmysdaughter,"YTA- it’s her sister, maybe this relationship is not for you. Sisters are for life. Her sister will also mature and change. If this is someone you see yourself with long term you better get used to her sister. Keep in mind this goes both ways. Could your GF ask you not to have your family members over as well. Is that OK? "
5,b751z6,t2_aj5h0,Shortandsweet33,YTA. It’s your girlfriend’s home just as much as it is yours. She’s entitled to have guests come to her home even if you don’t like it. Her attention doesn’t always have to be focused on you. Of course her and her sister have their own in-jokes and history. Your girlfriend’s life doesn’t revolve around you and you don’t own her. 
5,b751z6,t2_758cy,blandarchy,YTA! She and her sister have shared more than you can ever expect to. Of course they have in jokes you aren’t a part of. The fact that you resent this healthy family bond and make it all about you says a lot.
5,atvvn9,t2_2tarj1m4,Feanorian_Maia,"NTA, imo. I know a lot of people will consider this to be terribly rude, but OP, trust me, I KNOW your struggle. I have an incredible hard time remembering names and faces. Just recently, I confused a classmate (whom I've been going to school with for almost three years) with another. They don't even look that similar. Happened in front of the whole class as well. Everyone was so confused. Interestingly enough, I find fictional characters easy to remember. But real people? Nah. You could probably show me pictures of the most famous celebrities and I wouldn't be 100% sure who those people are. So, what I wanna say is, you could've probably just asked her, and explained your problem. I know many people get hurt when you forget their name, but most I encountered understood when I explained I have a hard time remembering people's names. You could've just asked and she would've probably told you and laughed, and it'd be a joke between the two of you. You're not an asshole, and I genuinely feel for you. Maybe start keeping a handbook for names or something?"

Bonus Question: ESH - Don't skip work just to avoid a social event and try to tell your coworkers / boss that you do not wish to celebrate your birthday with other people. If it's the only option maybe consider it but it will likely only provoke more awkward social interactions.
5,avwh4v,t2_zab64,craig_prime,"NTA. You just shouldn't have told them your birthday. Or lie when they ask. That's what I always do. Then when they come to celebrate I pull out the old ""What?

That just seems unnecessarily rude and hurtful... but he goes a step farther.. he details that he would totally screw a black girl but just didn't want to touch their ""low status"" long term.

You're not scary, no one is afraid of you, none of her friends are afraid of you. They all just think you're weird af, which you are if you honestly think any of this is an acceptable thing to say or think. This is NOT something that women want to hear, it does not make us feel protected or like you're a badass, it makes you seem like an extremely immature creep.

Honestly, the fact that you didn’t type the words “Are you fucking serious!?” is already a testament to your patience. I don’t think I could take the time to calmly explain something so obvious to a jackass who woke me up several hours before I had to wake up for work."
5,a2f28a,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"First I just want to note that if this was a guy telling a girl hypocritically what she could and couldn't do, while he broke his own rules himself, people would lose their minds! They'd call him controlling and abusive. This is not any different. NTA overall. You went a little far, took a huge leap to hurt her over something different, but she's INSANE. And she had almost no reaction to what you said, as messed up as it was. She brushed it off. She literally told you *she* can watch half naked guys in a t.v show because it's an hour long, but you can't play a game with a half naked animated girl because it's more than an hour? INSANE. By that theory, she would permit you to play an hour a week, as her show is an hour a week. You can buy outfits for her or download free ones (I didn't like her outfit so I put her in something else personally) but guess what? You shouldn't have to. And she didn't ask you to change the outfit, she forbid you to play the game. Tell the therapist that Dump her. Please. No one should put up with this over an animated game character. Let her be another guy's ex. "
5,a2f28a,t2_88j6b1n,MatterCaster,"In the first paragraph, NAH. She's a huge asshole with serious issues. In the second paragraph, YTA, but I see the point you were trying to make even though you were cruel. You both bring out the worst in each other, so you two should break up. Others have suggested couples counseling. I suggest make a clean break because I think the problems run too deep for both of you. This should be your ""honeymoon"" phase, where you both are discovering each other's quirks and finding them adorable. I think it's crazy to seek counseling when it hasn't even been a year. Sorry. She's not the one, but at least you tried. Be glad that you haven't wasted years or are dragging kids through the breakup."
5,a2f28a,t2_25wct7le,dinosvsthevirginmary,"YTA for saying that & reacting the way you did, especially when it’s not “in your character” as you said. HOWEVER, I honestly understand why you reacted that way given the constant emotional manipulation from your SO. It is in no way fair to you at all that she is acting on extremes like that. It is perfectly normal for couples to NEED time apart/alone time. It’s honestly extremely necessary for anyone to need alone time. You are two separate beings. I think she is TA in this situation, but you did not need to bring her past into the argument. "

If you really cared about this girl, then realize that you're not showing a very attractive side of yourself if you literally showing up to her work and not saying anything to her.

If she is abused; yeah it does suck. I have had friends who have dealt with abuse and I myself have as well, and sure everyone reacts differently and and deals differently but that does not give the victim an excuse to be an asshole to other people who are nothing but kind to them outside of the abusive setting. You've been kind to them and given them money, something you're not obligated to do but you did because you cared about this person. You are not the asshole for leaving a toxic relationship where one person gives and the other takes and there's no exchange. If anything report the abuse to authorities or somehow anonymously. If she's not abused; she's just not a good person for lying to get money out of you and attention. Coincidentally I am dealing with someone in what I think is this situation and it is really frustrating and let me tell you you are even less obligated to feel bad. You should ask for the money back and charge interest (and maybe to be helpful tell your friend to seek help from a professional, not to be rude, but lying about things like this might be rooted in deeper problems that you can't fix)"

What happened to you was unfortunate and I hope you get through it, get legal help or whatever you need to do, but she's not at fault for that either. You can't just throw bad things at other people's faces as an excuse for how you're behaving. I think you should tell her what happened and be honest and say you don't want to hang out right now. It's not fair to her that you're acting the way you are or for you to leave her hanging."
5,b6s66d,t2_ba06p,FrankGoreStoleMyBike,"NTA. This is exactly what you should do whenever a break up occurs. For a few reasons. One, break ups are rarely truly mutual. Even if both parties recognize the relationship is dying or dead in the end, one party usually has had a chance to start grieving the demise and accepting it first. You both need some space from one another to let those ""what ifs"" and ""maybe ifs"" die out. "

5,b5p8cs,t2_2yqr2egs,mysterious-milkshake,YTA Marriage is about compromise and this is something clearly important to her future husband (and your future son-in-law).

5,b5p8cs,t2_3ghnmz8e,Fuzzy-Goat,"YTA - She’s a grown-up, leave her alone and let her make her own choices. You can support the fact that she’s happy, just because you don’t like it doesn’t mean that you get a say in her big day. You’re literally telling her that you won’t give her money if she doesn’t do things the way you think they should be done.

You know all those wedding horror stories, about people getting worked up about things that have nothing to do with them, causing the bride and groom unnecessary stress because they're so self-centered they think someone else's wedding is about them?

5,b5p8cs,t2_8hl85,ParadiseSold,"YTA Your daughter will hopefully only be married once and you're going to throw a fit and miss it for a stupid reason. She clearly doesn't care about the label of Christian, probably because it doesn't mean anything if there's no Christ to follow in the first place. She likes this venue. She likes her husband, and wants him to get things that are important to him. And you're trying to fuck all that up."

If you're religious (and even if you aren’t tbh), and that's why you're upset about her lying that she is a Christian, I feel like you should understand her fiance's point of view. It's his religion.

The no kids rule is your BILs prerogative, but I can’t fathom why your girlfriend is upset with you. Your kid comes first, now and forever. That’s not being stubborn, that’s being a good dad.

5,b0bw7q,t2_2t7pzyc0,AllTiedUpRN,Nta. BIL is callous about something so important as time with your kid.

Do not engage, directly or with vague announcements. But...out of curiosity, how would you have handled it if someone who didn't identify on the binary spectrum applied?

You aren’t disciminating at all, I think it’s awesome that you’re also inclusive of trans women too. Respect people for their genders, and if you don’t want men in your group, don’t feel pressured to have to include a trans guy just because he was born a girl or because he’s giving you shit for it. "
5,aayx81,t2_nvmmo,Eilayth,"NTA. Girls only means girls only, cis or trans. Him being a trans man and tus identifying as a man, he doesn't fit the criteria. He obviously doesn't want to be treated as a girl, so he shouldn't expect to be accepter into an all-girls group, regardles of his genitals. "
5,aayx81,t2_ze0om,Candy__Canez,"NTA: He's a guy, identifies as a guy. He would be going on a retreat with all girls. There isn't anything good that could come of that. I'm not saying that he'd try to do anything, but he would make the girls very uncomfortable. "

Also, on the opposite sex thing, that may work good for now, but once people get married it’s a bit odd to go on a lunch date with a member of the opposite sex. I think your GF was being considerate of how most people feel about that. "

It's hard to talk to someone when everything they say is always negative, especially when they say the same stuff on a loop and nothing you say or do will solve their problems or cheer them up. At the same time I don't think avoiding people is the best way to go about the situation, maybe it would be worth talking to your friend at some point and saying that while you're happy to talk about their issues and support them you would also like to have some more positive conversations with them."
5,as3w1c,t2_5mpa0ap,AmIDoingThisRigh,"YTA. That’s pretty brutal. And pretty much every woman’s nightmare is aging poorly, so to be told flat out could be taken very badly. You could have been polite and just said that you aren’t attracted to her romantically. "

Most of these comments are not constructive, and are just simply calling you an asshole, or hurling other insults in your face. I prefer to give some advice for next time.

It’s been 8 *years*. “Oh, why don’t you like me anymore, you liked me 8 years ago. Be honest!” What?! Edit: For all the ppl saying you could’ve just said that you’re not interested, you saying “no” already means you’re not interested. They already got that answer.

It's not healthy for either of you. You should try to talk to her about this and sort it out if you haven't already. If nothing changes, break it off. You shouldn't stay in a relationship you don't enjoy with someone who stresses you out. Think about it this way. She like this now. Imagine what she'll be like years down the line?

You should have known that to begin with. Never lend money to family unless you can afford to lose it. The question is, can you keep a relationship with your daughter while she's married to a deadbeat? Especially because you know this is not the last time they're going to ask for a ""loan""."

EDIT: >Money is just an idea Holy SHIT. You might be the asshole for raising someone who thinks as money as “just an idea”. You can settle this in court if you have any documentation of this, and you can accuse the husband of taking advantage of your generosity. Your daughter will 100% resent you for that though. If you want your $1800 back, take it to court. If you want your daughter back, say you are giving $1800 as a gift, but you have to teach her money isn’t just an “idea used to control people”"

5,ammq8m,t2_2lwgqixk,CSUSThrowawayCactus,"NTA. He could even be purposely manipulating you. You never consented to a polygamous relationship, and he said that he chose you. He is a piece of shit who is probably using his condition to manipulate you, even if it's not a conscious choice he's making. All cheaters are pieces of shit, so know that at least. First, for the advice you actually asked for: no, you are not the asshole. Just maybe don't call him on his bullshit in front of staff because they have been trained to, and always will, take his side. Unsolicited advice? He's cheating, manipulative, his mental health is declining & he weaponized it against you... you need a divorce. Now I'm the asshole ;P"
5,ammq8m,t2_qmmfe,Gal_Monday,"... I'm really torn between YTA and NTA. I totally get where you're coming from and why you'd say that, so I'm hesitant to call you TA. But the dude is literally struggling with whether he wants to live or die. I don't think it's appropriate to try to make your relationship the #1 thing he's focusing on. As important as your marriage is to his life, it still has to come second to his actual survival. He has to get right with himself first before working to get right with you; it's just the way it is.

You’ve obviously ensured your daughter is getting a healthy and balanced diet and that’s all that matters. But I think bringing it up with her would be counterproductive. You’d just be validating that she’s achieved the desired effect of imposing her beliefs and upsetting you. I’m guessing your daughter will now be triple-checking anything she’s given there and that will be far more powerful Also check out r/JustNoMIL for support and advice..."
5,abms7w,t2_ijk6v,RachyRachington,NTA. Can I just say how brilliant you are for raising your child vegan. I am vegan but do not raise my child 100% vegan. There are many times when she is but the judgement and arguments I will get into with my family will do significant damage to my mental health. They already think I am being extreme with my diet choices. I am actively not doing something I’m passionate about and believe in because of other people. (And they say vegans are the pushy people!) My mother is already incredibly judgemental even though she knows I don’t raise her 100% vegan. 
5,abms7w,t2_4jpid,MsKim,NTA The point isnt if veganism is good or bad (it's good IMHO) but the fact that a parent told someone don't give X to my kid and someone gave X to your kid. I would avoid that woman like the plague. She obviously lacks good judgement and common sense. What happens if she thinks it's OK to leave her guns unlocked when your kid is around? What happens if she thinks it's OK to host a chicken pox party when your kid is at her house?
5,abms7w,t2_945p2,Raibean,"NTA, but I don’t think going to your BF’s mother directly is the best route. It’s his mother, he should deal with her. And if he doesn’t do with in a satisfactory way, then you should avoid her. He should be PISSED that she disrespected you like this.

5,b0pkn7,t2_4rrfb,AngeloPappas,"YTA. It wasn't the family that asked to come, it was your child asking his grandmother. The kid is too young to understand the family dynamic and reasons why his grandmother cannot attend.

5,b0pkn7,t2_129eqn,22OregonJB,Yta. This party is for the kid. And the kid asked his grandma to come. So instead you made this about you instead of the kid. Being 6 in a divorced family is tough. Having to try to understand why grandma can’t come to his party isn’t something he should have to worry about. That’s adult shit to worry about. Be a good person for your kid. It’s not gonna hurt you but may make your kids day.

Make them bring their own. Make them sit outside. Make them put gifts for their grandchild on a different table. But dont pretend you're doing it for any other reason that yourself. Keep driving a wedge between the child and his father and it will push him away from both of you. Go ahead, ask me how I know that will happen."
5,b0pkn7,t2_k86d1,Alybank,"YTA, of course they’re suppose to take his side, they’re HIS family, imagine if your side of the family took your his side in the divorce. I have no idea why that’s a problem for you. Also, this is your son’s party, and suppose to be about him, not you. This pattern of behavior as your kid gets older could spark a real problem for you. Anytime I’ve seen/heard of a parent do the “it’s me vs. an entire side of your family” the other side of the family wins. "
5,b0pkn7,t2_rlp8g,dawn990,"YTA Why are you resenting them that they took his side and not yours? How would you feel if your parents took his side? Your son wants his grandma at the party. This is all he understands. Don't drag your kid in your petty ""my time!!1!1!11"" war with your ex. Being a co-parents is a bit more then just dividing time equally. Sometimes you need to bend the agreement for the sake of your child."

I took my kids to both sets of grandparents to trick or treat, because MY KIDS wanted to see their nana and grandpa. Its not about me. it's about them. Stop worrying about YOU and worry about your KIDS like a GOOD PARENT SHOULD."
5,b0pkn7,t2_jnw77x9,vannobanna,"YTA- your son asked his grandmother if she was coming to his birthday party and she, caring about her grandson, got your ex to ask you if she could go. I assume your son asked because he wanted/was hoping she would be going. You say no because of bad feelings you harbor from the divorce. YTA because this is 100% about you, and not your son, who appears to really care about his grandmother and want her at his party. I recommend not using anything to do with your kid become about resentments you have towards other people in his life. One day, that resentment will be his, and it will be directed towards you. Just my two cents."
5,b0pkn7,t2_ww7t28r,N3rdProbl3ms,"YTA; The party is not about your broken marriage, its about your son. And your son deserves to know where he comes from. So both families need to suck it up for the boy and have some pizza and cake in silence. We're all adults, we've all been through awkward shit. We're not kids anymore and can't just scream no and run away. Or shit, call a pizza place, reserve a time and tell his family you'll drop your son off at that time and they can figure it out from there cake wise. Just let him see his family."
5,b0pkn7,t2_kkv0a,JarlBawlen,I've been in similar situations your son is currently in. Lets make this clear YTA. That is still your sons family and will be forever. You are making this about you. You see how selfish that is yes? 
5,b0pkn7,t2_2moqb1is,junedy,NTA - it would be a really miserable day for you. It should be a nice chilled happy day with all of your loved ones in one place - don't invite the ex in-laws and enjoy 😁
5,b0pkn7,t2_1c5lrolh,OokieGleek,"NTA, some people are better far away from your child, I wish my mom would've kept me away from my father (despite me asking her to see him when I was younger), I didn't understand at the time what a toxic person he is."

5,b0pkn7,t2_2b23ifw8,ColdPotatoFries,"NTA. Speaking as the child of divorced parents, I much preferred having a separate birthday party with both sides of the family. Kids can sense tension and anger. And I have no doubt that you and the grandmother will be hostile with each other, and the kid will catch on. If she cares so much, she can throw him a birthday party when it's dad's time. (plus the kid gets more presents that way :)))))) "
5,b0pkn7,t2_2paqf6qc,SpookyOuija,"YTA - my parents had split custody of me and I always felt so horrible having two parties.

5,b0pkn7,t2_qc3ok,_kalebb_,"YTA - I'm a child of divorced parents and the best thing they ever did for me and my brother was putting aside their differences on birthdays when we were young and graduations.

5,b9w5ko,t2_21t55rvf,Farlyfjord,NTA Regardless of the reason you can always not attend a wedding even if you RSVP’d. If you feel bad about it offer to pay for your food and get them a wedding gift. Try to talk to the bride directly to explain in person. Don’t let other people speak for you. 
5,b9w5ko,t2_3bfxf0gf,1_Justbreakup,"YTA kinda, but maybe not much of one. It seems you are more afraid than an asshole. But to your friend, I am sure she is hurt and you may owe her a more detailed explanation if you really want her to forgive you for your absence.

5,b9fnag,t2_ub2zo,miladyelle,"YTA. Program your thermostat to lower the temp during the day while you guys are at work, and in the middle of the night while you’re both in bed under blankets. Find a middle ground temp in the evenings that you can both be happy with. Don’t jump straight to telling a grown woman what clothes she should be wearing in her own home, geez. If y’all do bday/Xmas presents, get her a fuzzy robe and fuzzy socks. "
5,b9fnag,t2_1233xn,kerodon,"NTA She's just kinda being slefish and inconsiderate. You also worded it literally as well as possible. It's fine if she doesn't want to wear more, but should prob offer/be asked to pay slightly more for heating costs if you're changing the temp for her sake. "

5,ajxfsq,t2_2uq9frg6,redrumsoulessginger,"NAH... you reacted in a normal way for a sexually abused person and your family doesn’t know about what happened when you were a child. While I can understand not wanting to tell them, you should take some steps so you won’t be in situations like this for your own mental health. First, go to therapy. See if you can find someone who specializes in being abused as a child. You may not click with your first therapist, so don’t give up if you don’t like them. Find another. It may be difficult to rehash what happened with a therapist, but it helps. Look for a support group, you can probably find one online. Avoid family gatherings. If you want to visit your family, do it one on one. You shouldn’t have to come in contact with your abuser. Since you don’t want to tell them, you can come up with reasons for a while. If you do tell them, do not expect everyone to believe you. It would be nice if they did, but it’s very common for people to be in denial about their loved ones. "
5,ad2su6,t2_2lqbrznk,iwasthebread,NTA - sounds like you’re girlfriend didn’t want you there. Doesn’t matter that Ally didn’t invite you (although that appears to be a big oversight) it’s your girlfriend that should have thought of you & organised that you came too. But I would bet there’s a reason she didn’t. Proceed in this relationship with caution.
5,ad2su6,t2_p49zn,pat_is_moon,"NTA. Birthdays aside, your girlfriend messed up and treated you poorly. Unless it was a coincidental series of mishaps and she offers an honest apology and it never happens again, I’d say be careful moving forward and watch for any other signs of things like this happening. It sounds like an unhealthy relationship. But it could just be a big misunderstanding too! Good luck."
5,ad2su6,t2_197avcze,longdu4,"NTA but I think you already knew that. I think this should be posted in relationship advice. Unless that friend has ulterior motives she would or should have invited you. If it was just a group of her old girl friends doing surprise catchup that would be one thing. But you have been dating over a year! If the friend had any decency at all she would have checked with you to see if you already planned something, which most SOs would have. On top of that she invited all of the friends SOs and at that point your GF still doesn’t call to tell you to get down there. But I’m afraid this is actually a huge sign there might be a problem with your relationship. Most SOs would have been upset that their friend didn’t invite their counterpart and would have said something to the friend for not including you. Unless her friend really hates you, it makes zero sense that she didn’t 1. Just invited you from the get go or 2. Once all SOs got there she tells your GF to tell you to come down. Either that or your GF didn’t really want you there on her birthday with her friends, which I’m sorry sounds like the case and I think this is a huge sign your relationship is in trouble. "
5,ad2su6,t2_dnli6,Kaneohegrown,"NTA. You're the boyfriend period. You're the one who's there 100% of the time to be her (your GF) partner through good and bad, not Ally. You have every right to be pissed that your GF didn't push to have you included in the dinner. Even worse, if you had already mentioned you had plans for the two of you she should have told Ally she was already booked for the night. Put it this way, if on your birthday you blew off you GF (and any plans she made) to last minute hang with your boys at a bar would she be pissed? How much more angry would she be if you told her ""it's a no girlfriend/wife party, so you can't come"" then she finds out other GFs and Wives were invited to join?"
5,ad2su6,t2_2pj2dfc,ECCE_M0N0,"NTA. Your gf disrespected the hell out of your relationship for not telling Ally you should be invited once it was clear the seating was flexible. Also, she's pretty rude to invite Ally along to eat the cake YOU baked after they both snubbed you. I really hope you're both young, like, 19ish because that's the only way this is remotely understandable. My 2 cents: Bake your gf another cake, and eat that one too."
5,ad2su6,t2_11f38g,Akasgotu,NTA. Ally is an asshole and your girlfriend is an even bigger one. Holy shit. Who treats people like this? This is one of the most egregiously inconsiderate things I've read on here. They can both fuck right off and you should find someone who has a little consideration for you.
5,ad2su6,t2_2vjurm7o,claimable,"Unpopular opinion: I'm on the fence with this one. Mostly NTA You should have been invited, but surely if your girlfriend asked her friends they would have said it's fine if you joined too? Especially since you two already had plans, I think it's really unfair on you. Secondly, I think your girl should also have made time for you. I understand her friends over and they don't have much time together but you haven't seen her since your night got cancelled. It's not hard to turn to your best friend and explain that she needs to spend some time with you too since your plans were ruined. I'm sorry I kinda think your girlfriends the asshole. "
5,ad2su6,t2_1hut2pt1,saducky,"NTA and that’s horrible. Ally sounds like a jerk and so does your girlfriend. I’m just trying to imagine myself in this scenario, and I would be miffed at my friend for not including my SO. "
5,ad2su6,t2_26mo5rah,burgerchucker,"NTA Ally hates you for some reason, your GF might have talked crap about you early on in your relationship or something. Your GF doesn't care about you very much either, since she would have asked why you weren't invited when all the friends have their SO's there. The fact they squeezed a guy in shows you are not important enough to you GF to contact or spend important time with. I think you need to see what else is wrong with your relationship, and if it were me she would be dumped already and I would start looking for a partner who is loyal and caring! Good luck dude, your GF sucks and Ally is a dick!"
5,ad2su6,t2_ejjrv,TheReplyRedditNeeds,"NTA Sounds like Ally might be jelly of you ( taking her best friend away) and invited everyone but yourself, which is fucked. Also judging by your gf's reaction it seems she didn't care to have you their either which is even worse, Definitely NTA and deserving an explanation. "
5,ad2su6,t2_aeu6y,stefaniey,"Nta. Ally knew you were a couple. You should have been the first contact to arrange a surprise party, even if it was ""girls only,"" and seeing as it wasn't, it's a deliberate snub. I'd be wondering what your girlfriend tells Ally about you that 1. She didn't invite you to begin with and 2. Your girlfriend didn't immediately ensure you were invited and present. "
5,ad2su6,t2_ehvq7,power602,"NTA, but you absolutely need to confront your GF on this because she didn't care that her closest friend intentionally left you out of her birthday celebration. She most likely doesn't think it's a big deal, so let her know that it is and you want some closure on why she was okay with this. I would consider this a red flag, so be cautious moving forward with this relationship."
5,ad2su6,t2_2sju1483,WandofMagicMissile,NTA lol my gf/wife wouldn't have even sat down until this was settled. She didnt really want you there. Other dudes that they wanted to be there showed up :P Random friend didnt even respect you enough to meet you or take you into account. Best friend wouldn't be my wife's best friend after that.
5,ad2su6,t2_lw40o,SauceQue,Nta. If this was me the whole cake would have been gone. You have every right to be upset. If someone had a surprise party for me and my boyfriend wasn't invited I would immediately want to know why. After whatever excuse I am told I would of invite you even if you needed a reservation. Your girlfriend is acting way to casual about this I think. Talk with her and let her know how you feel about the whole ordeal.
5,ad2su6,t2_ehua9,FreddieTheDoggie,"NTA. This friend however is a major league asshole. Not only throwing a surprise get together, RSVP only, on her actual birthday, thereby eliminating anyone in the know from seeing the birthday girl, but for not thinking to invite those important to her. I'm honestly surprised your girlfriend didn't stick up for you and try to get a seat for you at her own birthday, And for so quickly flaking out on seeing you on her birthday, which it seemed like she was planning to do as soon as another opportunity came up. I'll go ahead and say it, your GF might be a minor asshole. Sorry man."
5,ad2su6,t2_88g5c,OPtig,"NTA Ally totally iced you out. The girls night thing was bs, especially fiance was there. That said, I'd say you have an SO problem rather than an Ally problem. I know Ally was the big asshole here, but she fucked off back home after her territorial birthday piss onto your girlfriend. I'd be more concerned about how your SO didn't realize what was happening and correct the problem. If she didn't recognize the problem, that's a huge red flag. This is so obviously wrong that you shouldn't even have to explain it to her. "
5,ad2su6,t2_2maehk7e,YourewrongIMR,NTA. I’ve helped so surprise birthday parties for my girlfriends before. And it happens in one of two ways: 1- it’s a girls night out kind of party where no ones SO is invited BUT we side chat their SO to find out what day works out best for both our friend and *gasp* her and her SO’s relationship. It doesn’t take much time to call/text them and say hey we want to take X out for a surprise girls night out for her bday. Can you let us know which weekend night works best for us to do this? 2- it’s an everyone is invited party! In which case we still call up SO first thing to get their help in the matter and find out what they would love to have happen for the surprise. The above things are not difficult as they merely refer to the basics of being an adult who isn’t an ass. —— Also concerning is that your gf didn’t seem to think about your feelings in this. Even if at first you’re going off of “limited # of seats”. The first thing I would be doing privately with Ally is figuring out why my SO isn’t there. And if she didn’t feel comfortable I’d be asking. Yeah? Is this a happy surprise party for me? Or is this party for you? Let’s just be real. 
5,ad2su6,t2_3ptp7cw,moktailhrs,NTA forget about 'Ally' honestly dude if your SO doesn't think to include you on one the most important days in her life it means that she doesn't think your important enough. That she 'forgot' or didn't message you to come afterwards speaks volumes. Don't be surprised if you do make it. 
5,ad2su6,t2_12fy3l,chiborg9999,NTA - sounds like your GF is telling Ally that she’s not that into you. That was an intentional snubbing on Ally’s part and your girlfriend not being upset / wanting you there is a huge red flag. Best of luck!
5,ad2su6,t2_zjil1ub,Charponnaise,NTA. This is really off and I don’t blame you for being hurt. It should have been clear that your relationship is serious so the fact that all the other partners were invited....gawd. If it were me in this situation I would let it cool down and then have a calm chat with her and let her know how excluded I felt. The tone of her response would then give me some clues as to whether the relationship was going anywhere.
5,ad2su6,t2_sbe73,madpandaswag,"NTA, it sounds like your gf didnt really care to have you around. I mean if I was at my own surprise party, I know for sure the one person I would want to be there with me would be my so, especially since everyone else had their so there too. Could it be possible that she wanted to seem single for the night? Or that there was already someone there who she was eyeing so she didnt want you to be there? I'm leaning towards your gf not being as serious about your relationship as you are."
5,ad2su6,t2_2djejbn6,champagne-kisses,NTA. Ally should've done two things: 1. Should've asked you if you already had plans for the day and 2. Should've definitely invited you. Your gf is also to blame since she saw everyone's partner there and didn't extend an invitation to you to come on over. I would be pissed. 
5,ad2su6,t2_7hw4b,lookayoyo,"NTA, but take you can become the asshole depending on how you handle it. Eating the cake it pretty minor, so you’re in a good spot. Don’t be a dick as a reaction. Recognize that your gf wanted to see her friend and sometimes things get hectic and it’s hard to make everyone happy. But communicate how it made you feel to her. Not with the objective of making her feel bad, but make yourself feel heard. If she apologizes and empathizes with you, then thats a good sign of a mature person who may have been caught up in the moment. If she gets angry or starts defending herself (assuming you aren’t accusing her, and instead express “I feel” statements) then that’s a red flag."
5,ahztf9,t2_jq798qg,narsfweasels,"​NTA. >My mom told me that LB said ""if SO doesn't move in, maybe I'll see if she will let me move in. There's plenty of space."" No, no, no.

5,b0agw8,t2_z5kgr,amy4947,"NTA. Your aunt thinks it's appropriate for her dog to shit all over the mall? Uh, no. It's her dog and she needs to learn to control it. If you had pretended everything was okay, she would've kept believing everything was okay. I probably would have waited until you were in private to bring it up, but I can't blame you for doing what you did."
5,asgq3e,t2_zm4j6,kashikoicat,"NTA and no, you shouldn't have apologized for setting boundaries at work, and then backtracking on those boundaries. But you shouldn't have ""freaked out."" You could've been calm, said something like, ""Let me look into how this will fit with my schedule,"" and then go back to him later and say, ""I don't have the time,"" maybe even showing what your schedule looks like."
5,aoyto1,t2_99gcgn0,cactuspenguin,"YTA First of all, talk to your girlfriend. Tell her if something makes you upset so you can talk it out (calmly please). Secondly, I don't really get why you're upset? It was her who send you the videos so it's not like she's trying to hide something. Was it close, touchy-feely dancing? Then I'd understand your reaction. But just normal dancing with friends, being drunk, having fun? That's normal and she's just partying with no bad intentions. Also you can't tell from only two snaps if they really were alone (not that it would even matter that much). If you trust her girlfriend, let her be. Just because she's got male friends doesn't mean she's cheating on you."
5,aoyto1,t2_nmb19,OfficerThis,"YTA , if you're not comfortable enough to have her go out and be friends with males then there is a trust issue. She sent you the video which should be a sign of it being nothing to worry about; if you cant trust her that's a different conversation "
5,aulzij,t2_239ot1t6,Coxinh,"NTA. There's a reason it's called *your* time. You already have them on her time, because of her inaction. If it's time with the kids she wants (which is good!) there are days she can do that. It's the reality of divorce, specially not friendly ones."
5,aulzij,t2_7ec02,McFlyyouBojo,"NTA. She is. I get that she wants time, but she can't pick and choose. She must do what the court tells her. If the court says she gets them friday, she gets them friday. not friday AND one of your days. If she wants change, she needs to go to the courts. Now, Every once in a while if it is a special occasion, there is no problem letting her have the kids on certain special occasions, so long as you both agree to arrangements. But let me tell you what. If you start giving her the kids on YOUR days, That shit can be used against you if she ever tries to blind side you with trying to legally gain more custody. They WILL take that into account. Vice versa as well."
5,9v67pn,t2_hhmtrnn,ItsATerribleLife,"YTA. If she wants you to know, she'll tell you. If she forsees things getting intimate , she'll tell you. If her potentially being a transwoman is a deal breaker, back out now (without saying anything like ""I think you're trans and i'm not into that""). "

5,b47s9v,t2_13orl7ae,Bingalingbean123,"NTA- the birth control thing is especially concerning. However, not sure how you could raise it without saying “hey, stop being a spoilt brat”. Is there things she does for you always? Like,’perhaps the cooking or the bills etc? Perhaps it isn’t so one sided "
5,b47s9v,t2_2k24lsce,PasionatelyRational,"NTA. She’s definitely abusing your kindness and is unappreciative of it. It could be because she enjoys being babied around. But in that case she has to admit to it and ask how you feel about that. And if you don’t like to be her “daddy” that does crap for her all the time, she either sucks it up or finds someone who satisfies her. Or, it could also be that she’s an entitled person who thinks that you catering to her needs is a duty and not a gesture out of kindness and love. Either way, I’d definitely bring this up in a polite but assertive way. You shouldn’t keep letting it slide. "
5,b47s9v,t2_35832jcz,Jasper_J_Jones,"NTA ffs, she is a lazy cow! You need to stand up for yourself. You should insist on wearing a condom too, or look to taking male birth control, so that having a baby will be your decision, not anyone elses! Basically, just tell her to 'do it yourself'. If she doesn't she'll be late for work, and if she doesn't turn the light out, take the bulb out and buy side lamps - if would infuriate me!"
5,b9whjf,t2_xv636,ex-inteller,"NTA. You're an adult, it's your life. It's polite to ask your parents opinion, but they're not the ones who get to decide your relationship with your extended family. If your parents are put in an awkward spot, well they're just going to have to decide if they love their daughter more than bullshit. Being in limbo is a shitty place to be. You're not forcing their hand by admitting to everyone who you are and being yourself. "
5,a8e7pv,t2_2nw6m2ad,FriendlyMum,Nta. You told her you were going to eat one. Just because there wasn’t one for her to eat doesn’t entitle her to some of yours - especially if there was heaps of other options for her to eat. Your mum offered a great compromise though. If she’s still targeting you perhaps politely ask her to share her food a few times to show her how it feels... 
5,a8e7pv,t2_2n4q22oj,callmelola32,NTA. she could have made her own pizza if she wanted one and your brother did not want to share. Even if she didn't want the whole thing she could have put the rest in the fridge for later or offered the rest to you. 
5,b1266d,t2_tah6n,WaffleDynamics,"ESH You're an asshole for wanting to stealth kill your wife's dog. If you do that, you will be killing your marriage at the same time. Your wife is an asshole for not training her dog, and not being seriously concerned about the safety of her own damn child. That dog didn't want to hurt your child. If it had, it would have broken the skin and crushed bones. Even a chihuahua can do serious damage to a toddler if it wants to. For whatever reason, the dog is not mentally healthy. It might be in pain. It might just be poorly socialized and poorly trained. Now that it's 10, you're not going to be able to train the dog into being more friendly. Have you asked your wife if she's ok with raising your son to be afraid of dogs? Because that's what her choices are doing. I suggest couples counseling, stat. "
5,b1266d,t2_sol0e,ptsfn54a,"YTA if you do. I understand the desire to protect you child, but there are many options besides making it someone else's problem or more likely killing the dog (nobody would adopt an older grouchy dog so it will most likely be killed). I for one would never trust someone again who did something like what you are describing. If it were a friend who did this to his family, we would not hang out as often if at all, if it were my SO it might break us up."
5,b1266d,t2_okv73,Xsiah,"YTA - You do have to make sure your child is safe, but not by going behind her back with something that big. It should be an informed decision. Maybe she can give the dog to someone she knows, maybe you can take it to obedience training. Everyone here who is talking about having to put their dog down isn't wrong, but they made that difficult decision themselves - if they can barely forgive themselves for their reasoning, imagine how hard it would be to forgive someone else."
5,b1266d,t2_g7knv1f,jolie178923-15423435,"NTA But don't do it without her consent - *yet*. Try to get through to her and enlist the help of others, like a pediatrician. or show her this post and all our responses: **OP's wife** - I understand you love your dog but your dog is legitimately endangering your child. Pull your head out of your ass."
5,b1266d,t2_hkncr,dmtvile,"NTA dogs dont like me for some reason, so i can sympathize. whatever you do, dont do it without at least telling her your going to. maybe find a friend/relative that will take the dog. if you tell her that your taking the dog to xyz she will have to say something. i would say no assholes here, but if she shuts down the conversation, then thats a dick move."
5,b1266d,t2_38mmt6nq,Shigo96,"NTA. That's truly a shitty situation. But regardless, you should talk to your wife about that. This dog really is a danger for your son. And it'll definetly turn you into the A if you get rid of the dog behind her back. The next time your son gets bit, he might bleed or even worse. So it's clear that the dog has to go. Cause sometimes people just simpyl can't react in time. And then what? Exactly. Now that'll sound crappy, and I'll probably get downvoted below hell: But if she refuses to get rid of the dog, then I'd actually go as far as telling her it's either you and your son or her dog. At this point, getting custody for your son won't even be hard, as your son clearly isn't her first priority. Or else she would've gotten rid of the dog right when it bit him. Of course she'll be sad since she loves that dog. But a child, especially a toddler, always comes first. Period."
5,b1266d,t2_tuw0d,evilclaptrap,Even though it sounds like you'd be doing the right thing don't do it. Train the dog and stop acting nervous around him dogs pick up on that. If you can't get rid of the dog make him get trained. Your wife can't have everything her way. Nta
5,b1266d,t2_2z2cfclp,AccioDeepDish,"NTA. But don't get rid of it without telling her, maybe call her and tell her she has two days to find it a home or make some other decision about what happens to it. If she doesn't deal with it, you are either getting rid or it or taking your son and going to stay elsewhere until she gets her priorities in order. "
5,am3emj,t2_1wen3l5m,mothwhisper,"YTA. I don’t think you’re a monster of a bad dude or anything, but being a woman who works with the public, it absolutely sucks when you can’t do your job in a friendly and positive way without getting hit on. She was at work to do her job, not to chase tail, and hitting on her at her job (by sending her flowers there) was inappropriate. "
5,am3emj,t2_10qp4g,Scanty_and_Kneesocks,"YTA based on my own hatred of hitting on girls at work and how 99% of the time it shouldn't be done because they're being nice and polite because it's literally their job. You recognize how cringey it was *but still went through with it*. Bad sign, my dude. Bonus *Not Asshole* points to you for not doing a follow up and knowing you don't deserve a response, tho. YTA but not like... Maliciously."
5,am3emj,t2_32o4hedc,ytayta,"NAH Yeah, it's probably a bit cringey, but you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. So whatever dude, you tried and it didn't work out. Don't get all stalkery now though. You gave her the chance to reach out to you and she didn't. So no weird social media friend requests, additional flowers, accidentally running into her at the hospital, none of that shit."
5,a90egv,t2_1719d4,arboreallion,"NTA. Its perfectly reasonable to want your money back especially if your friend kept saying he was going to pay you back. He was stringing you along. But just for future reference, never lend money (especially to friends or family) and expect to be paid back. Either you won't be paid back or you'll end up ruining the relationship trying to get your money back 9 times out of 10. Sadly, most people aren't very good and honest when it comes to money. "
5,a90egv,t2_2lqbrznk,iwasthebread,"NTA but maybe you did overreact alittle. Either way, he sounds like a loser so I would steer clear of him in the future. Nothing wrong with asking for your money back & you shouldn’t have to keep asking. "
5,a90egv,t2_gancp,AtticusFrenchToast,"NTA and he's trying to gaslight you. Both of your text etiquettes suck but I don't think that's enough to make you and asshole. If 50 euro isn't a big deal to him, then why didn't he have it? And if 50 euro stood between him being fine and him being totally fucked, why doesn't he understand why you need it back? Something tells me he does get it; he's just a thief and a manipulator. I wouldn't give him the time of day again (or loan money you're not okay with losing)."
5,a3jowo,t2_emwucn,Cinnamon_Razzmatazz,"NTA. There's definitely something suspicious going on here. I'm certain that your mom isn't telling you the whole story too which is why she is probably angry with you for saying something. You're just trying to look out for your mom though and, without more information to think otherwise, this does seem like a situation where you and your mom are being taken advantage of. Good on you for giving your mom your room. Sounds like she could use a break."
5,b5ugbq,t2_3c5vbvrj,GennaTallia,NTA - your brother needs help immediately! He is clearly having some sort of issue he cannot manage himself and you are getting hurt because of it. You do not owe him forgiveness. He has pushed you to the point where your only option is to protect yourself from him. I hope your parents see this and get him help because he’s going to end up in jail or worse. I’m sorry you’re in this situation. 
5,b5swgw,t2_2nz4zq5s,thewhitewallisblue,"NTA, but your parents are major dicks for making you be a mom to your siblings. I know things you grow up with seem normal but this is NOT normal. I know you said you can't move out yet but you can slowly start a plan to do so, your parents stole your childhood and they're going to keep taking your young adulthood too if you let them."
5,b5swgw,t2_iqkla,major84,"NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA ... get that through your head .... you are not an asshole !!! You are right , you are not his mother...and shouldn't be expected to be baby sitting him to this extent... get one of the boys to look after him.

5,b5swgw,t2_ypigm,ca_agent,"NTA I know this is probably lost in the comments but please try to understand and learn how to say no. It is a complete sentence. They may be mad, don't defend yourself, explain or whatever. Just no and you do you. No. That's it. No, while you live your life for yourself for once. Please learn how to say no and leave it at that. "
5,b5swgw,t2_k77x3,GorillaGrey,"NTA. Being a sister or brother, does not mean being a parent. It is irresponsible of a parent to put that responsibility on their child. My mom did the same thing, except I'm the oldest, my sister is number 2 in line of age, and we both had to baby sit and take care of our younger sister and brother because Mom and Step Dad were doing something other than parenting. Not parenting being going out, talking on the phone in the garage secretly smoking, etc. "
5,b5swgw,t2_2a5gdmsk,nate2092,NTA but you really need to save up and move out. Your parents are selfish and are not gonna change. They should be parenting their kids not you. They've walked all over you all your life that it's impossible for you to tell them no. You have to realise that it's okay to tell them no and to work on moving out. These people will not change and you have to get away from them Do you have any friends you can stay with and save up money until you find you own place? 
5,akk8ii,t2_ibmc0,HereticalMessiah,"NTA - It sounds like he’s being pretty passive aggressive. When I wait for my wife to eat after she has had a long day at work I will generally make us both something. If I know she’s making herself food and I’m feeling lazy I will just ask her if she minds making me something too. But to watch you make food, sit down, and wait 10 minutes and then to throw a full blown fit? Something else has to be going on. "
5,akk8ii,t2_xndsz,FrankCastle316,"NTA. I'm failing to see how you've done *anything* wrong. You work a long day, come home, clean, put the kid to bed, and then go for food. Seems pretty standard to me, *especially* since him not waiting until you're home to eat is the norm. It's not as if he didn't know you were getting food together, he was in the damn room with you! If his intention was for you two to eat together, he should've spoken up immediately. ""Hey, I know we don't normally eat together, but I was waiting for you to get home. What're you hungry for?"" is all he would've had to say. Not sit, watch you make a plate, change rooms, and *then* wait 10 minutes to get uppity about it. You're definitely not the asshole here."
5,akk8ii,t2_61b3s,sadsquash,"NTA. Sounds like there is more going on than just him being hungry. Seems like something is putting him in a foul mood. If you know what else could be going on, try to focus on that. If you don't know why else he could be acting like that, go ask him if there's something going on he needs to talk about and have an open conversation about it. It's just odd that you made a plate, you both went to sit together, and then only 10 minutes later does he get up all angry with you. Surely there is more going on here."
5,akk8ii,t2_22geyri1,TheRepeatTautology,"NTA, I've done what your fiancé did before, it usually that I'm annoyed at myself for not asking or that I'm hangry (hungry and angry). If he cared he had the chance to mention it while you were making dinner and could actually do something about it! "
5,atjoi5,t2_2ze5g0tg,Kellogz27,"NTA There's a big difference between following your dreams and being unrealistic. Most artists don't live off their art alone: most have another job next to the art because making art is generally not going to pay aal the bills. The fact that she is unwilling to have a part time job besides the art should make you worried. She should be following her dreams, but being realistic is also important."
5,atjoi5,t2_mkgv55h,sapphicpenguin,"NTA. I've wanted to be a writer my entire life. But my mom made me understand that, until/unless I make it big, I need a day job. People have bills to pay and need money to pay those bills. Your girlfriend is not being realistic right now. She can keep doing her art, but she also needs a day job in the meantime. Hopefully someday she'll make it big and won't need that day job anymore."
5,atjoi5,t2_3so58a7,Naranay,"I'd say YTA but not for being worried about your financial future, but for assuming she is going to fail. Just because you made the choice to quit your dream musical career doesn't mean she has to. If supporting an artist isn't in your life plan, then maybe leave her. Generally artists struggle. It's part of being an artist. If she accepts this fate, then that's on her. You don't have to, but you also *don't get to tell her to abandon her dreams.*"
5,atjoi5,t2_2rh58fxt,dissapointingsalad81,"NTA- However, she doesn't have to discard her dream. She could get a job and do her art as a side thing. She doesn't have to rush and if she keeps working at it in her spare time, she might get lucky."
5,av2min,t2_2x2vu6uu,espanasocialista,"NTA or NAH. He shouldn’t have texted asking for more... BUT doordash actually takes their tips and uses it to pay them less. So if the delivery was $5 and you tipped $3, the dasher doesn’t get $8. They get $5 - $2 from doordash and $3 from you. If you were to pay that in cash, however, doordash would still have to give them the full $5 and then your money would be a real tip. So I don’t blame him for asking, but you aren’t the asshole because technically you already did tip. I just thought you might want to know that going forward :) "
5,b5u6ss,t2_e9wn07w,BlowsyChrism,"YTA Shit happens. Stop analyzing it so much. Is it possible that she bailed? Sure, but it is bizarre how hung up you are on it. I would just say sorry you're not interested and move on. No reason to make a huge deal out if it "

She's gonna kick and scream, she's not going to pull punches with what she's gonna say and do....you hold the line. If not for her, then for yourself.

Or just check in from time to time and show compassion. "

You’ve been together for three years and he doesn’t talk to you about things or mention you to other people? Asking him a simple and justified question requires you to work up courage? He’s talking to his exes and hiding it? He’s accusing you of things you’re not doing and being paranoid and disrespectful? None of these things are okay and none of that takes into account that this dude is almost 40?!? Run. You’re wasting your life."
5,aursly,t2_1712ox,404funnotfound,"NTA. He sounds sketchy. I’d never stay with someone like that. Dump him and move on. You deserve to be with someone that makes you happy, and that you don’t have to wonder about. "
5,aursly,t2_a7sl2ib,MysticalFrost,"NTA AT ALL! He’s flirting with his EXE’S?! Noooo way would I ever allow that. My boyfriend would be in deep shit if he was doing that, and he knows it. My boyfriend doesn’t even talk this exe’s, partially cause he doesn’t want to or care about them, partially cause he knows I wouldn’t be happy about it. And *this* is exactly why I have a “no ex policy.” You need to tell your boyfriend about how you understand he’s used to open relationships, but you’re in a monogamous one now, and this is *not* how these kind of relationships go. You need to be 100% clear about your feelings and your boundaries, and if he’s not interested in respecting your boundaries than maybe you need to reconsider your relationship. Also, taking the laptop to the bathroom is pretty damn weird. Flirting with other women, especially exe’s is just disrespectful and rude to you and your relationship. Together for so long, and he hasn’t brought up the fact that he has a long term, live-in girlfriend? This guy has sketchy written all over him! And he’s making you feel like you’re the one with the problems! Nope, not at all. Damn, my boyfriend wasn’t even official with me and literally *all* of his friends, including one of his exe’s new about me. "

Don’t over sell it, just start acting like it reminds you of a less stressful and more relaxed point of your life. I’d even go so far as to add some small childish like items, maybe a stuffed unicorn, rainbow lamp. Don’t just give your SM the enjoyment of having this weird control over your room decorations. I do get that it’s your dad and SM’s place, but you having a small choice of a couple of changes in your room, shouldn’t be an issue. It sound like she just wants some form of control.

No. He should get a friend/family member to come pick it up at a good time for you. Is he an asshole for breaking up with you like that? Yes, he is and you're upset but it's done it's over now.

5,b04cn9,t2_dtgs2k0,madeofivory,"ESH. On one hand, it's your wedding your choice, plus its not even happening yet. It wasn't cool of her to react by getting the family involved. On the other, I can understand being hurt by being excluded from a hypothetical wedding because of how siblings are typically considered for the bridesmaid position. It sounds like theres a reason you don't want her in your wedding, like a problem you're having with her or something, and if it is a problem you think can be solved, my advice would be to discuss it with her calmly and rationally. The only thing that would put you in the wrong is not being honest about the problem, if there is one that is. Otherwise, NTA."

It’s ridiculous to blame him for how he lives because it bothers you. Most colleges have courtesy hours and mention you can’t blast music. How would you feel if he blasted music at 3AM when you wanted to sleep? If you wanna blast music, go and buy your own house with no roommates. Until then, unplug the fucking speakers and deal with using headphones like the rest of us in college do. "

Have a healthy relationship and live happily ever after. "
5,avrhoh,t2_9p9r3,greenpoe,"NTA. You should be expected for pay for the first date for sure, maybe the first few, but after that point, talk about it. If she really and truly believes the man is responsible for paying, then just go cheap dates. Cooking together, going for walks, stuff like that. If one person invites the other to do something then that person is more-often responsible though.

If he'd be okay with this arrangement, that would be one thing. But he's clearly at least disappointed, maybe a little resentful now that he's figured out you expect this from him but refuse to return the gesture, so you both either get used to a relatively head-less existence, or get into the spirit of giving. And upon rereading your initial post, definitely YTA for never actually telling him you wouldn't do it. Maybe he also finds it less than fun but gets over it knowing you love it. If you'd've told him, he would've managed his expectations. "
5,a74x5y,t2_29fnwzeu,SchwiftyHeathen,YTA- even if it isn’t something you like to do it’s pretty selfish to only take and never give. You don’t “owe” him anything but if you love him you could certainly “suck it up” every now and then and do something you know he will enjoy. I don’t enjoy doing the dishes or cleaning the bathroom but I will certainly do those things because it makes my wife happy. If you can’t seem why YTA here you should consider being single for a while 
5,a74x5y,t2_1lvc81je,P_Flange,"YTA. If he was just giving you head and you didn't reciprocate that would be one thing, and you wouldn't be the asshole in that instance. But, you are actively asking for it and at the same time telling him you won't do it to him, that makes you the asshole. You absolutely don't have to do anything sexual that you don't want to do, but it takes some cheek to ask for that kind of one-way relationship. "
5,a74x5y,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,"NTA. I so want to say YTA but I can’t because you’re never obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. Don’t be surprised or angry if he decides to stop “giving”. In that scenario, he’s not obligated to do anything he doesn’t want to do either, and the reasons why are irrelevant. I already sense some anger, and that does make YTA. "

5,ar2f6b,t2_2g2fclq0,mirabiletemporis,"NTA It doesn't even matter why you don't want her to do it, it's enough that it's something you really don't like and she's repeatedly ignoring a boundary that you have clearly set. You have tried compromising and giving alternatives an she still disregards your comfort and does what she wants instead. That's not okay. ""I'm just having a little!"" That made me really angry because it's not about the food, it's about her keeping on doing something that you have said no to. There's nothing little about it, a no is a no. It's not bonding if it only makes her happy and that is, in fact, a big deal. If it wasn't she wouldn't have gotten angry when you gave her the plate, right? &#x200B; Ask her how she would feel if you ignored something she had asked you, repeatedly, not to do.

But, you're very obviously over stepping the boundaries here. No one wants to go out to eat now, that's not fair. He's set a boundary with you, you need to accept that. It's not unreasonable, and to invalidate his issue is just as insulting as you suggesting he called you a pig. Basically you're saying his feelings don't count, at all. He doesn't find it cute, romantic or anything. Grow up and act like a wife and not a selfish child or this marriage **will** fail, and sweetie, it will be **your** fault."
5,ar2f6b,t2_ub2zo,miladyelle,"NTA. The ‘tee hee I’m so cute and quirky being an obnoxious twit’ thing isn’t acceptable for a 14 yo girl, it’s pathetic for a grown and married woman. Hold her to her word on not wanting to eat out anymore—go out solo, and enjoy getting a full belly from a peaceful and relaxing meal. It really is underrated, as much as meals are considered social events, to go out and eat alone. Take a book, or make sure your phone is charged before you go. And for once dinner won’t be a battlefield or a slow drain on your sanity; it’ll be a nice change, I’m sure."
5,ar2f6b,t2_b131f5z,Boo155,"Absolutely NTA. Your wife is engaging in a form of abuse. She knows what your boundary is and she is repeatedly violating it. And then, like a typical narc, she refuses to admit she is wrong and over-reacts and sulks in a corner. She sounds like a real peach. When she does it again, and she will because she is an asshole, shove the whole plate at her and order another for yourself. Do it every time. YOU are not the one making it a big deal, SHE is, by refusing to respect your boundary. I hate ""family style"" dining. I order what I want because I want it. I don't want to eat what the others at the table are eating. If someone asks for a bite politely, I will let them take some on their plate or use a small plate to give them some. But using your utensils on someone else's food, without their permission, and ESPECIALLY if you know they dislike it, is a total asshole move."

A little sample from your plate now and again (not every time!) is cute, but devouring half of your meal every single time is just rude, selfish and inconsiderate, especially when you've asked her not to and she ignores you. Disrespectful. I don't blame you for getting annoyed. "
5,ar2f6b,t2_2u8931er,misucaroline,"NTA. She’s being the asshole here. Every time she crosses that line from a couple bites to too much, slide the plate over and order another one. I promise you she will get the message and stop. And don’t back down! Even if she’s like oh no no I’m done! You order that second plate, make her see you’re serious. Do that a few times and she’ll learn. "
5,ar2f6b,t2_119zfw,AgentMintyHippo,"Definitely NTA. She should have ordered her own of whatever you were having rather than pick at it bit by bit. She is not respecting your boundaries and regardless of why you don't want to share, she should respect that.

5,ar2f6b,t2_9cb5y,heili,"NTA.This is your wife, someone who should love and respect you and that means respecting your boundaries as well. The issue here really isn't just the food - it's that she thinks it's cute and funny to not respect your boundaries. That makes her the asshole."
5,ar2f6b,t2_p026x,RussianEarlGrey,"NTA. She's the asshole. Seriously, it's not cute. It's annoying and ugly. She said you made her feel like a pig? It's cause she is one. I hate this so bad. Just like you I get sharing a pizza, or chips, cookies, candy. That food is meant to be shared. But at a restaurant where she orders hers and you yours? No. And if she'd like a bite to try it for next time then she asks first. "
5,ar2f6b,t2_hwwhk,cap826,"NTA what she’s doing is unacceptable, because you’ve established how much it bothers you. If she wants to split a dish with you she needs to ask, something like, “the chicken looks good and so does the pasta, want to share them both?” BEFORE you guys order. Granted I’m not married but even in a romantic relationship if I’m interested in sharing a dish I establish that before ordering. "
5,ar2f6b,t2_ni27b,Monalisa9298,"My husband did this too. He’s a nice man. It’s a cultural thing. But it drove me crazy. I had to train him to wait until I was done with my food, then he could have whatever was left. It took a few years, honestly. Anyway, NTA"

If your feelings and being able to relax when you go out isn't important to her, why should you worry about her feelings and making her feel like a pig? (which she was totally acting like btw.) Bottom line is she's consistently doing something that upsets you and doesn't give a shit, then when you call her out she plays the victim.

It’s your food, you paid for it! 😣 Hell you could throw it at the wall if you wanted before giving it to her (would be a waste tho, and kinda weird 🎶). And you even generously offered to buy your wife some of the food which she denied. <- this part makes me think it’s more psychological than her thinking she’s cute. At the risk of armchair diagnosing, her comment about ‘being made to feel like a pig’ and wanting to eat off your plate instead of getting more food - does she have problems with food possibly??? I dunno I don’t want to pin labels on things but that stood out to me. (But that isn’t your fault and she shouldn’t be stealing your food)! Or maybe, she could just be a controlling and spoilt person who doesn’t like being told no and then sulks when she doesn’t get her way (again this stood out to me but I don’t know your wife so I could be projecting from people I know irl who do this *cough* 😬)! NTA! NTA! I’m sorry you had a fight but you don’t need to apologise it’s understandable you’re fed up, mate. I hope things work out for you ✌🏻✨"

5,azxkx5,t2_9u2dl,VortexMagus,"YTA Honestly it's a tough situation, I don't think you should at all be forced to date a girl you're not interested in, or someone who won't fit in with your family. But the way you went about it was super bad and quite racist. For future reference, there were two MUCH better ways to handle this situation. First option, give her a chance - agree to go to dinner or coffee with her, try and get to know her better, and if you're still not interested at that point, tell her that afterwards. I did this with two girls and no hard feelings were had. Nobody's asking you for a permanent commitment here, just an hour or two of conversation. Bonus, you get dating experience (better at small talk, learn a little bit about yourself, etc) even if it doesn't work out. --- Second option, when she asked for a valid reason, tell her something OTHER than ""yes, it's because you are black"". Reasons include: 1) I'm not attracted to you, sorry 2) I am not into pushy women who follow me around demanding reasons after I gave them a perfectly adequate no. 3) I'm interested in someone else, sorry. --- ""You don't fit into my culture"" is a weak excuse that sounds racist as hell. First of all, you don't know her very well, do you? So maybe she *could* turn into a perfectly dainty Indian flower, how would you know, you've never given her a chance. Second, I'm willing to bet that at least *some* of the girls you like and would be willing to date probably won't fit very well into your culture either."
5,azxkx5,t2_1kfdjj5y,avocado__dip,"NTA. She shouldn't have demanded a reason, she should have just let it go. However, in the future, do not say that again. Lie lie lie. Being honest in this scenario will never do you any good, people don't want to hear that you don't like them because of their race. However, you need to reconsider how you live your life. Not because you're wrong, but because it sounds like you don't think for yourself yet. Why worry so much about pleasing your parents? In the end it's your life, not theirs."
5,azxkx5,t2_p58ha2g,welp-here-we-are,"NTA, though your parents’ opinions aren’t okay either. You’re allowed to not be attracted to certain groups of people so even if you could date anyone you’re fine, but maybe don’t say that.!She’s blown it out of proportion and it’s unfair that you’re being removed from clubs because you turned her down.

Demanding an explanation is equally obnoxious. &#x200B; That being said, I think I would not have 'confirmed' that you wouldn't date her because she's 'black' - maybe said your parents are very traditional so you don't believe in dating outside of an intended marriage. However, I also get why you'd panic when a person was coming at you in front of a bunch of people and sort of blurt out any old thing. "
5,azxkx5,t2_j06x9,JDDJS,"NTA. However, when she asked you if it was because she is black, you should have said no, and then say that it's because she's not Indian. In the future, you might decide that you'll be happier marrying a non-Indian, but you don't have to make a decision now. Side note, you should check out The Big Sick. They're Pakistani not Indian in that movie, but otherwise it should be very relatable movie for you."

5,b25ii7,t2_1rqej1og,wildwalla,"NTA. Adults get to decide the relationship we have with our family members. When it’s so easy to cut someone off, it takes actual work to keep up a healthy relationship, and what do you owe to someone not doing any work for you? He’s probably not gonna like being ignored, but from your description this guy is not easy to please at any time. "
5,b4ejwe,t2_2oijha1b,BigQuestions5,"NTA- You are never *never* the asshole for policing how your body is touched or handled by others. He is very wrong for disrespecting your wishes and continuing to touch you when you ask him not to. You need to seriously confront him, and if he doesn’t listen again you should consider leaving. And if I’m reading this right, he touches down your pants when you’re.... sleeping?? Oh that’s really not okay. "
5,b4ejwe,t2_mqtgk,mayfleur,"NTA. This isn't just ""touching"". If he's feeling you up, and won't stop even after you tell him no (and by that I mean, he keeps up with this behavior and doesn't respect your boundaries), then he's in the wrong. It doesn't matter if you're dating or not. You said no."
5,b4ejwe,t2_2mujmsi8,laralye,NTA this sounds incredibly aggravating so it's totally reasonable for you to not like all this touching. This would make me feel like I was just some sort of sex object to him. You need to sit him down and have a serious discussion about how handsy he is and how annoying you find it. 
5,a8pyze,t2_12gpol,Underground_Queen,"C is correct that you're being a dick = YTA. Grow up and accept that your friends can be friends with other people. Meeting people online is normal these days.

Definitely the asshole. "
5,a8pyze,t2_a7sl2ib,MysticalFrost,"YTA - I’m someone who met my last ex bf while playing online games, and I went on a flight, alone, to meet him for the first time while staying with his family for 2 weeks. Granted we were together for like, 6 months before doing so. But still. If you were genuinely concerned for his safety, that’s one thing, since this guy is a stranger you barely know. But nowhere in your post do you say you’re concerned for his well being, mainly stating that L should make his own friends in his own state... I feel like you’re jealous about C branching out to other people. "
5,anhdzk,t2_53r7q,pottersquash,"NTA. Congrats! You learned your fiend is also unfaithful and manipulative. Its one thing for her to remain cordial with your exs, its another to tell them the things you told her in confidence. Thats utter asshole. "
5,anhdzk,t2_punl9,forester93,"NTA, the language was kind of difficult to decipher here but I'm going to assume English isn't your first language (in which case good on you because English is fucking hard). This girl obviously is someone you can't be friends with. She is blatantly lying to you and doing something behind your back that would end almost anyone's friendship. Cut off any ties with this girl, keep your head up, and carry on with hopefully better friendships and relationships in the future. "
5,anhdzk,t2_ejezs,DizzyDezi,"NTA - if you see red flags in any type of relationships, you should usually listen to your instincts. Ask yourself, are you really losing anything by ending this friendship? If not, then what really is the harm? Sounds like she enjoys chasing guys you end relationships with, so I don't see any point in staying in contact with her. I'd ensure she is off all your social media accounts so she doesn't stalk you anymore. "
5,ap8iru,t2_51y8so7,yyy_guy,"NTA. sadly your sister is still in your mother's reach and she might take some of the fallout. protect yourself first and cut ties. if you are able to help your sister get out of the house, do that. if you can't do that, have a talk with your sister to tell her what you are doing and why. i understand that you don't want to press charges against your own mother, so don't do that if you feel wrong doing it. good luck."
5,b50f5u,t2_xdhem,derTechs,"YTA yeah dude, sorry. she is your gf. that would be a GREAT way to get her into your family. especially if others take their partners too. is your gf a little child? if not, you don't have to be around her all the time. if she gets along with your family then she'll be entertained enough without you too. I don't see any valid reason not to. take her with you. "
5,azxay6,t2_1116bg,flammable1313,"NTA I'm married a guy who is super into video games. Me asking him to stop loving video games is like me asking him to stop being himself.

5,azxay6,t2_2nf2f6d5,JackieChansStuntGuy,"NTA- sounds like she’s already ready to break it off if she’s giving an ultimatum. Especially if the problem has never been discussed before. Some women who want to break it off with a man wait until he does something like you did, and grasp at straws just to break up. If it wasn’t buying the game it would be you didn’t take the trash out right etc. Call it a hunch but I can almost guarantee there’s another guy. If you see this comment let me know when it comes out if I’m right. Women typically don’t leave a relationship unless they have something else lined up, or there’s something you’re just not telling us. "
5,azxay6,t2_ylcdjhw,Sabazito,"NTA. If you spent your alone time with videogames, what does she care? It's the same situation as if you were reading a book while she is at work, and she would've said ""books or me"". No offense, but that sounds to me as she would be a Control-Freak, who must decide about stuff that isn't even her slightest concern. It would be a totally different situation if you would sometimes decide to play videogames instead of doing something with your girlfriend, but that's not the case, right?"
5,azxay6,t2_3a6a0fra,Musashi10000,"NAH/NTA Communication is key, Bro. I said in another post that testing is grounds for leaving, because manipulation, but this seems less like a test, and more like... I dunno. Ask her what it is she's worried about with video games. Has she, for some reason, gotten the impression you play too much? Ask her why. Is she worried that, if/when you get married, you won't help out with the kids? Reassure her. Is she worried you spend too much money on video games? How much DO you spend? If it's a lot, maybe you should cut back a little. Ultimatums are the quick road to end relationships. They're never good, they're never healthy, but they usually reveal something about the other person's concerns. Explain that you want to know what she's worried about, and that if, in future, she's worried about anything, she can just come straight to you with the why and the how, rather than issuing Ultimatums. If there's a problem, a real problem, you'll take what she says into consideration."
5,azxay6,t2_111o2n,IncredibleGonzo,NTA both before and after the update. Jumping straight to an ultimatum like that without even a discussion makes her the asshole. Issuing an ultimatum like that to hide the fact that she wanted to break up with you anway? Doubly so.
5,azxay6,t2_49ugadm,MisterMarbles1988,"NTA bro just date a girl who is into gaming, or at least tolerates gaming. My ex-wife and I would play games all the time.

5,ahio30,t2_17xdk4gq,cityzombie,"NTA for not wanting kids. It's smart to be as safe as possible with this too like you want to be. Just some advice: be very upfront about not wanting kids, with everyone you date. Dating someone that's on the same page with it, will definitely help your fears too because they'll be preventing it more. "
5,ag8qzp,t2_6a5kf,XxmsmaliciousxX,"Nta. Not even close. YOUR WIFE put you intentionally in a situation that triggered some ptsd. She knew about your past. She should have immediately realized her fuck up, and consoled you, properly apologized and told her brother that they fucked up. That he's out of the money because she neglected to remember something traumatizing. Your BIL probably didn't know. And he should have immediately after being told, just accepted it and also apologized. That's some /r/justnoso and /r/justnofamily shit going on there. "
5,ag8qzp,t2_p9swv3v,ClementineCarson,"I thought from the title that maayyyybe you were the asshole but seeing how they are insensitive about triggering you and you didn't break it on purpose, NTA"
5,ag8qzp,t2_x6cdp1k,SquirrelGirlVA,"NTA. It's not like you broke it out of anger or retribution. It was a kneejerk reaction, an automatic reflex from PTSD. I can somewhat see your wife thinking that this was just going to be a prank and that you wouldn't react like this (I wouldn't have done it personally), but her reaction afterwards is pretty shitty, as is your BIL's reaction. All in all, they're the assholes in this. I would refuse to pay for it. If he's going to pull a prank like that, he needs to expect that someone may react badly. Even if it wasn't you, it may have been someone else who reacted badly and *would* deliberately break it out of anger. "
5,ag8qzp,t2_12fy3l,chiborg9999,"NTA - divorce is in your future, amigo. Hate to say it but your wife doesn’t care about you to do that without thinking of how that would trigger you. "
5,ag8qzp,t2_t3bqdkp,Slothfulness69,"NTA and your wife is an asshole. She definitely doesn’t take your trauma seriously and that’s terrible. This is absolutely your BIL’s fault. Jokes like that aren’t funny. It was alluding to sexual assault, and you never know who has experiences like that, so jokes about it are off limits. Any half-sane adult knows that. "
5,ag8qzp,t2_9mswd5h,Miofwin,NTA. Imagine the shit storm if the genders and scenario was reversed. This was horrible prank and your BIL and wife are boths cunts for the way they are acting. Your wife should never have allowed the prank to go forward and she should have informed your BIL it was a shit idea. I'm honestly suprised you didn't swing at either one of them to be honest. 
5,ag8qzp,t2_fhiuu,MozzyZ,"Even if the video was just some random scary face that caused you to accidentally break the headset you wouldn't have been the asshole. But the fact that it was a video that reminded you of a traumatic experience *that your wife knew about* puts you even further away from asshole territory, if anything pretty much pushes you towards the justified territory. NTA - but your wife's a huge asshole"
5,ag8qzp,t2_14h0r1,seth928,"NTA 1000 times over. Your BIL is kind of an asshole but didn't know your past so he was an asshole after the fact. Your wife on the other hand...I can see where she might not have expected such a response even knowing your past (still, she should know better) but she is a huuuuuuuuge asshole for brushing it off like that."
5,ag8qzp,t2_27r2ssi5,Boredread,NTA Your wife definitely sucks. It sounds like she knew what you’d see. Idk if you are financially liable but i hope not. Trauma triggers are serious
5,ag8qzp,t2_155su8u6,SingleBuilder,"NTA I think you’ve reacted quite well, I would have kicked the fuck off- I do think your wife was an asshole though. How could she think “it’s just so funny, I’m sure he’ll get over that near rape trauma in his past”"
5,ao9swn,t2_rr9g16d,clouds6877,"NTA but I’m wondering why your bio mom keeps giving them your information? It feels like to me she’s shoving off the mother responsibility onto your instead, so she doesn’t have to “deal” with them. And props to you for picking yourself up, and I agree with the rest of the comments. Work on yourself first, and set VERY STRICT boundaries with your bio-siblings. They are really young, so even ignoring them seems like doomsday, but if you don’t set these boundaries now they are gonna keep pushing until you break. "
5,apc2b5,t2_2j1g9sp1,pokinthecrazy,"NTA &#x200B; OK - maybe a little bit of an asshole but some situations call for an asshole. And when you directly tell someone to not eat your food and they do it anyway, it's time to unleash your inner asshole. &#x200B; So keep calling her Miss Piggy and get her the fuck out of your apartment. Frankly, I'd ban her ass the 2nd or 3rd time I caught her eating my food."
5,apc2b5,t2_19cqecxg,fathusky2341,All the people saying ESH. FOOD ISN'T FREE. Totally NTA if she ate my food after telling her repeatedly I would do a lot more then just call her a messy pig. Nice one though. Another way would be use a trap food. Make some food and put laxative in it. That would teach her. EDIT: He kicked out his spineless brother and miss piggy. Hooray! 
5,apc2b5,t2_7ual2ix,earlgurl33,"NTA. Next time you should feed her some diarrea inducing chocolate cake or something you KNOW she would eat. So, it's perfectly ok in her eyes to do something you've asked her multiple times not to do, but when you turn the tables she can't handle it? I know that sounds cold, but i'm a woman and i've been overweight at times. If someone asked me to stop doing something, especially eating food i'm not paying for, that belongs to someone else, I would. She needs to stop doing the activity that is getting her labeled. "
5,apc2b5,t2_14rv4z,Sqarlet,"NTA. You tried the nice way, she basically laughed in your face and kept eating your food bought with YOUR money regardless of repeated requests not to. So weird you would have to lock your fridge to stop basically a stranger raiding it and leeching off you. "
5,apc2b5,t2_1210ca,glitterswirl,"NTA. She shouldn't be eating all your food. You've told her before not to eat your food, and she laughed at you. For reference, I'm also a heavy girl. However, I know exactly how upset I'd be if someone ate my food which I had planned to, and so *would never do that to someone else*. I treat people as I wish to be treated, in that respect. "
5,apc2b5,t2_zrz4gn4,ShutterBeez,Nta The oinking was mean but she was acting like a pig. Not because shes larger but because shes eating everything. 
5,apc2b5,t2_n5k4z,RSZephoria,"Heya, fat chick here. NTA at this point. She should have stopped eating the food when y'all asked the first time. I never eat food from a person's house unless I am either offered or I get a ""Yes"" after asking first. I can't believe she would just eat food that wasn't her's or her boyfriend's. So the way I see it, you were pushed into fat shaming her in order to try and get her to stop. That's why I don't see you as the asshole in this situation. "
5,apc2b5,t2_c5hz6,Yukimor,"NTA. You told her to stop. You told your brother to get her to stop. You reiterated your boundaries repeatedly. She barreled past them because she doesn’t give a shit about the fact that it’s your property. Shaming her is an acceptable response. **I’d also like to add that you were shaming her behavior, not her weight— you were throwing the shame exactly where it belongs.** If you were shaming her weight, that would be a whole other can of worms. You were shaming her for behaving like a pig. She doesn’t like that? Tough. Oddly, it didn’t seem to stop her from stealing from you, so it must not have bothered her *too* much. What other reasonable recourse did you have? You shouldn’t have to buy a second fridge to protect your food from someone who doesn’t even live there. You can’t stop your brother from bringing guests over, so no locking her out, unless there’s something in your lease that allows you to veto guests. She’s the asshole and she brought this on herself. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. The assholeness of calling someone “miss piggy” is cancelled out by the fact that she knew what she was doing and continued to do it. She doesn’t want to be called Miss Piggy? I’m sure you’d be only too happy to stop if she’d leave your food alone. "
5,apc2b5,t2_rg9bdph,odonnthe,"NTA. Being fat is a choice. Stealing food is a choice. Ignoring people's polite requests is a choice. People on here who are saying you are ""mean"" are deeply confused about personal accountability. She already KNOWS that you will do this when you catch her eating your food. She's walking out in front of the bus. "
5,apc2b5,t2_27rzmr05,gothgf25,"ESH, but I understand why you did what you did. I would do something equally petty like let her eat the food but then calculate the money it cost then bill her at the end of the month for being such a b*tch and eating what doesn't belong to her. But yeah, name calling to someone who clearly has a food addiction/mental health issue isn't great form."
5,apc2b5,t2_32jnd1j1,ItsMeMblergh,"NTA. Is she poor? Broke? How is she.. Chubby, slightly overweight if she's poor? That saying, I'm also slightly overweight but I'm working on it by NOT eating others' food (or my own that much) because 1) Food isn't free 2) It's incredibly rude to just eat SOMEONE'S food?! If she comes over just to eat your food.. Take her keys? Does she have a key or something, or does she hang out only with your brother? If she won't stop it or your brother will do nothing, why won't you just lock the fridge in some way? Or lock your foods away from her? I don't think there's a way for ESH in this situation. I mean, eat someone's food, expect at least be called names or pay for it."
5,apc2b5,t2_2kx5gegv,Ihatecoughsyrup,NTA. You said you told her many times and you spoke to your brother as well about that and she is still eating your food. I think it is very disrespectful and she seems to have no boundaries. I reckon the nickname is cruel but in your place I would have been pissed too. You explained her politely that her behavior was upsetting you but she choose to ignore it and keep eating your food. Enough is enough. 
5,apc2b5,t2_zhhq6,peppy_dee1981,"So just FYI, the way that i finally stopped my asshole BIL from stealing all my leftovers was i had inadvertantly left noodles in the fridge for like 3 weeks.... he ate them, got sick and couldn't figure out why he was sick. I asked him what he ate, he told me, and **bling** a light clicked on, so i told him that it was like 3 weeks old. He was so mad, it was hilarious. But like seriously, stay the fuck outta MY fridge!!!! Also, NTA! That shit was totally justified!!!"
5,apc2b5,t2_10zrp4,Darelz,"Good post, I'm torn between ESH and NTA. On one hand calling her a pig is an immature way to handle the situation. One the other, I think ass-holes totally deserve to be mocked for being ass-holes. I think the problem is all the solutions to this problem suck. Solution 1 : Buy a second fridge and lock, which is obviously unfair on you since you're the one who has to pay for it. Since you're a student I think it's reasonable you wanted to avoid this solution at all costs. Solution 2 : Put something in the food to deter her from eating it. The first problem with this is that the more likely a substance is to deter her from stealing your food, the more likely you are to get into trouble if you use it. The worst you can do without any risk is make spicy food, which is totally ineffective if she likes spice. Secondly, you have to waste time/money making food you can't eat. Again, I understand why you avoided this option as a student. So that left you with solution 3 : Bully her until she stops stealing your food. It's mean, but it's the only solution where the one causing the problem has to deal with the negative consequences. Plus she had the opportunity to avoid further mockery; if she didn't want you to mock her she could've just stopped stealing your food. Furthermore your plan actually worked, the asshole no longer wants to come over so she can no longer steal your food. I think ultimately NTA. She is the one who brought this upon herself. Sure, you *could* be the bigger person and just pay for a second fridge... but why should you have to bare that cost? People who act like assholes deserve to be treated as such."
5,apc2b5,t2_2utr216d,A3D17T,"Nta If that woman is continuing to eat your food, she can't be bothered by it that much. I feel like she was just trying to be over dramatic and start trouble between you and your brother. "

But it won’t kill her, and if being that “disrespectful” is what it really takes to make her understand she needs to stop, then so be it. It’s not like you met her for the first time and said “wow, what a fat piece of shit. Oink oink.” You May have said the words, but she brought it on herself."
5,apc2b5,t2_b34ex,Slummish,"NTA. To some people, food is a weird subject wherein ""my food"" and ""your food"" are things. I guess it's like that in roommate situations. God help this planet when famine comes. People are going to be losing their fucking minds."
5,apc2b5,t2_ppbcblk,Sproeier,"NTA Your brothers girlfriend is definitely the asshole in this situation. Even beyond the costs of the food, it is really annoying to do more trips to the grocery store even if you got the money back (i assume you didn't get payed the money back).

5,apc2b5,t2_jmglsg3,strangegurl91,"NTA. You tried being nice about it, asked multiple times for her to stop.

You do what you gotta do. "
5,apc2b5,t2_1yr6yuss,diplomaticDeveloper,"NTA here. Don't get me wrong, your comments were mean, but I don't think they were uncalled for. She's essentially stealing your shit, and she refuses to back down when you tell her that's not okay. That said, I think the more mature thing to do is say she's not welcome back if she's going to eat your food. Your friend is a complete pushover for letting her food addiction come before his roommates."
5,apc2b5,t2_24kc73o4,altonlepage,"ESH, adults don't handle problems by name calling. YTA for picking on her for something you know she's self-conscious of. It also might not be a good idea to create a bad relationship with your brother's gf, especially if she's likely to stick around. That being said, she also shouldn't be eating your food though. I suggest maybe asking her to chip in for the cost of your groceries. Either you'll at least get some money back or she'll decide it's not worth eating your food."
5,apc2b5,t2_2ib590kw,AVerySnaileySnail,"NTA You attempted to be civil by asking her numerous times not to eat your food. She is an asshole since she is eating your food and doesn't care. Your brother is also an asshole for letting this happen, although he can't really stop her. Calling someone a name for coming into your house and repeatedly stealing from you does not make you an asshole, especially since your only connection to her is that she's the girlfriend of your brother, and since she's not your girlfriend, you don't have to care about the feelings of someone stealing from you. Honestly though, just go to the people you're leasing from and make it so she can't enter your apartment. But I don't think what you're doing is uncalled for.

I can sympathize that the need to stuff your face is real but allowing yourself to take other people's property especially after they've said NO, MULTIPLE TIMES firmly puts her in the camp of Asshole.

5,apc2b5,t2_mtu5nfo,ConsterMock93,"Everyone commenting YTA or ESH is probably a miss piggy themselves. Its your food and you told her and your brother multiple times to stop eating it.

You were fighting fire with fire, since no other reasonable defenses were working. You have a right to your own stuff. bottom line - she's a thief. Food is money, and she's invading your personal space. She SHOULD be ashamed. If she's not then that's the problem. After the 3rd or 4th time I think it's fine to take off the kids gloves and say harmful things. Just try to be forgiving if she makes a concerted effort to change. Let it go, if the opportunity arises."
5,apc2b5,t2_28ys3cur,jitterybrat,"ESH definitely but I would do the same petty shit, honestly. She’s stealing from you guys which ain’t cool. Your brother won’t speak up about it and she has no self control. Your bullying seems to be working in regards to making her stop. I mean what else can you do? It’s not your responsibility to drop all this money on another fridge with a lock. SHE SHOULDN’T BE EATING YOUR FUCKING FOOD! Also, you don’t need to buy another fridge. You can buy these little lockable cages for food. Just lock it up and put it in your normal fridge. Maybe put a sticky note on it that says “For human consumption only! No piggies!” All jokes aside, stealing is way meaner than a little name calling but still, ESH. I’d say NTA only because reading about this infuriated me but in reality, you were kind of being an asshole too. "

That’s no bueno. Probably wasn’t the best relationship from the start, but especially after you suspected he was actually the other guy, you should have told him to fuck off. Also, this guy you were texting with. You weren’t interested but didn’t shut him down either. You let him pester you into sending pictures AFTER he sent you an unsolicited dick pic! You say you just wanted him to leave you alone so you could go to sleep, and that’s all you should have said. You didn’t have to appease him at all. As soon as you realized you weren’t interested/he might be your fwb, he should have been told to fuck off too. All I’m saying is that you can do better. Develop some boundaries and stick up for yourself with guys. "
5,b3rseb,t2_4ot72d,Safahri,"YTA so much. I have a deviated septum. Honestly it can be one of the most annoying, uncomfortable and painful things to have. Half of the time I can't even breathe properly and more often than not it becomes a huge problem when walking/running, eating, sleeping. People can seem fine, I've had this problem for a very long time and you just learn to deal with it. And no it doesn't make it any better. It's not just a nose job, and you'd be a complete asshole to not support her on this. I've had parents like you that didn't let me get it fixed and didn't bother to think about what I *NEED*.

If you did a simple Google search, you could see that it can lead to breathing issues and sinus infections for some people. >she’s been fine for the last 16 years. Fine doesn't mean optimal and it doesn't mean she hasn't been having problems. If you want to get a second opinion, that's fine. If that doctor agrees with the first doctor, then you better pay up."
5,b3rseb,t2_mfzwh8,bobd785,"YTA. A nose job and surgery for a deviated septum are different. Surgery for deviated septum does make the nose straighter, but that's not the purpose.

Also, being leashed is for other dog's AND your own dog's safety! I have a german shepherd/bordie collie who's very protective of her people and can be dog aggressive if not introduced to other dogs properly. If your dog ran at me unleashed, she would lose her fucking mind. (She's a good girl, if you approach her slowly and let her sniff the other dog and introduce her she'll be their new doggy bestie.) "

That said, you can kind of get into being an a-hole if get into preaching about why booze is bad or that sort of thing, but as long as you're just choosing for yourself, you're well outside of asshole territory.The counterpart of that is that anyone who sees you as being holier-than-thou just because you don't want to have a drink is exactly that kind of asshole. They're not content to make their own choices, they want you to make the same ones as validation. Edit: And especially on your birthday, you do what you want to do.

It's the society we live in and the climate of the average person since, like, alcohol was introduced to the human species lol. Most normal people who drink also won't mind if you *don't* drink. If they do, they have weird insecurities about drinking if they need a partner in crime. If your boyfriend is normal, he might egg you on a little bit in the beginning, harmlessly, and when he sees you really don't have an interest, I'd imagine he'll back off and enjoy a drink himself. If not, that's on him, definitely not you. Either way, the only people who will view your decision to not drink as a power play are the assholes who probably drink too much anyway, and subconsciously think everyone else is judging them. Otherwise, I don't think most people care. "

Word of advice, don’t base your personality around being a non drinker because you already sound pretty obnoxious about it. Do what you want but understand that others aren’t bad for choosing otherwise. If you don’t want to drink on your birthday organize an event at a location that doesn’t serve alcohol. Problem solved.

If your husband doesn’t want to eat what you cook he can make himself a peanut butter and banana sandwich for dinner. Or whatever else he wants. He’s being extremely unreasonable.

5,ati7b2,t2_2vdkzn7o,KelseyaVaughan,"*Waves in vegan* hiii ESH/NTA? (I don't think he is either) So I'm a vegan (F24)(insert joke about how do you know when someone's a vegan), and my boyfriend(M27) is not. I do 100% of the cooking, because he's so very bad at it. I make only vegan food. I rarely make a non-vegan dish for my BF, unless it's like adding cheese to his tacos, because I'm not a monster. I'm not cooking him meat, it's just not something I want to do. He can cook all of the meat he wants, IDGAF, but he never wants to, so he just eats what I make him. He loves my cooking, and he's happy. When we go out he always gets something meat-y, it doesn't bother me at all. If he told me I *had* to cook meat for him, I'd tell him to shove it. So. I think the same situation is in reverse for you, OP, your hubby can be vegan all he wants, but if he does 0% of the cooking, then that's his problem. If he's not even going to help you cook, for several children, then he needs to figure out a situation for his new vegan lifestyle. He's a grown man, and is capable of cooking for himself. I'm not going to give you a big speech about how you should make him vegan food. It's also, not just *you and him*, you have three children who are not vegan, and children can be picky, so it can be really hard to make vegan meals, they will actually eat. There's things you can make like, spaghetti that can be made without meat for him, etc. etc. There's lots of options. There's also lots of vegan replacements, like butter/milk/meats, that he can use for his meals when you make a dish for everyone else. But at the end of the day, you have kids to feed and they come first. He shouldn't be forcing you to make his separate. I think you guys should have a conversation about whats *doable* for both of you. Like maybe he cooks more often, or maybe you guys have meatless mondays, or he does **something** to help out. Because springing ""I'm vegan, drop everything and feed me"" is kind of a shit move &#x200B; TLDR: A vegan is telling OP she's not the asshole. She has to cook for several children and herself. Husband is grown ass man and shouldn't force his whole family to transition. &#x200B; p.s I don't think you're an asshole for ""Blindly supporting the meat industry"". Like honestly, fuck him, that's rude. I've never said that to anyone. I've been vegan for 4 years. I hate mean vegans."

I dont expect people to accommodate me unless Im paying them, like at a restaurant. Its just not a reasonable expectation. Now I think if he were to ask to slowly introduce it, like maybe one vegan meal a week, that would be reasonable. Or he can try to prepare a vegan dish the kiddos like.

You probably have plenty of vegan stuff in your cupboard already, you just didn't realise. This is a super easy lifestyle change to accomodate for, and you're being unsupportive. You heard the word 'vegan' and stopped listening. It takes two second to google the words 'basic vegan meals'. Maybe try it before you dismiss the idea entirely. "
5,ati7b2,t2_uao5f,QuietKat87,"NTA. It's hard to accommodate such a different taste, especially with small kids. Yes, you stay home, but your budget only allows for so much. Now, some Vegan foods can be more affordable to make, but depending on where you live, the ingredients may be hard to find. Plus it is time consuming to have to make your own mayo or almond milk to accommodate his new food journey. Vegan mayo and almond milk are not super affordable either. So maybe you guys need to all sit down and look at some vegan recipes. Maybe decide to try 1 vegan recipe each week or every month. Maybe that will help your husband try new things without completely blowing your budget and wasting food. &#x200B;"

Staying at home with the kids is HARD."
5,ati7b2,t2_7r641,OodalollyOodalolly,NTA - Perhaps he can find space in the budget by giving up something else? Then he can buy specific ingredients for A meal to try. Package up the leftovers for him to have for dinners/lunches. Then you and the kids just cook and eat the food you usually eat. Tell him if that goes well you will consider doing another meal the following week. I think this is generous.
5,ati7b2,t2_bhqwd,chambertlo,"NTA. Veganism is not “life altering”. It is restrictive, costly, and keeps you from getting all of the nutrients your body requires to be healthy. Most vegans I know are super miserable, look weak and skinny, and just look aesthetically unattractive because their body just doesn’t have the nutrients it needs. You need to tell your husband that he should modify his lifestyle to be compatible with the rest of his family and not the other way around. Majority rules, and he needs to learn to make his own shit before he is forcing the family to change theirs. Lastly, Vegan food is garbage. "

Leave the kids out of it, because clearly neither of you knows enough about nutrition or veganism to ensure that the diet is balanced (not saying this as an insult just taking it from what you said).

Op knows what she needs to get to cook those recipes. Could she try one vegan recipes a week or something? Yes but it's still extra work and she shouldn't have to do it or be yelled at for not wanting to. If her husband wants to try and switch his diet, that's great but he should be the one to do the work. He should be the one to go out, find ingredients that fit the budget, find recipes the whole family might like, and then cook it.

5,aahkj8,t2_2s41cv59,MsLinda70,NTA However I would of let him go first. Because the father wasn't in control of his child the little guy just did what a 4/5 year old would do. I like the fact that you explained to him he had to wait his turn. Adults can't be patient imagine how a child feels. 
5,athc6g,t2_dn9au,Swiollvfer,"YTA. If you were uncomfortable and wanted to leave should have let your friend know (at least in a ""I'm just gonna go home"" or something like that). If you made plans and bailed on her without telling her anything, you were kind of an asshole."
5,ady61s,t2_2uhckv0d,KizzMeeh,"NTA. Why does she think she's entitled to 'not want a job' while obviously you're both raising a child and are trying to live comfortably. If the child was not in school yet, I would totally understand her position. But since your daughter is off to school 6-8 hours a day, I don't see why she would not be able to have a part-time job during that time. It sounds like she's gotten used to leaning on you for finances. My main opinion is that it's not fair that she doesn't want to work while you've been the sole supporter for years. Edit: I already feel guilty when my boyfriend buys me groceries, while I work too. "
5,ady61s,t2_2xc7gb0g,mylyfemyrulz,"NTA. But your wife is. Hell, if the family is struggling financially she needs to step in and help take some of the stress off you. Its not fair for you to have to bear the burden when she is able to help. Shame on her. "
5,a8pz3y,t2_12iyz0,BillThePsycho,"NTA You tried to make plans they didn’t. Then they drop this on you out of the blue. That’s not cool. You made an effort to be smart about this, they didn’t. You’re all good. Also, can I come to your dinner? I’m in Cali but I’d love to be there in spirit! :D"
5,a8pz3y,t2_yhrrg,Obrigadachan,"NTA!!!!!!!!! Lol it's like a booty call but from your family. Some people are planners, others aren't. It's fine to have different tastes.

5,amh016,t2_udmac,Hunterofshadows,NTA If your son wasn’t involved I’d say YTA because you wouldn’t get a say in who she dates. You actually still don’t.

5,b23fq8,t2_qzhsx,MakeAutomata,"YTA, kindof. Your cat really wants to be outside but is scared to do it alone, so find something that you normally do inside for 30-45 minutes, and do it outside so your cat can enjoy himself too. Not a huge asshole, but its a pretty minor inconvenience that might not even last long(after doing it a few days/weeks he might get the courage to be alone)"
5,a2shl0,t2_cdq5e,Aedipus,"NTA, but I mean it wouldn't hurt to try to be at least civil with this person as you guys are gonna be around each other a bit "
5,a2shl0,t2_swhlp6,glassfury,"NTA Absolutely not the asshole. She already showed you her true colors, and anything she does differently now will only be because of your girlfriend, not because she actually gives a fig about you as a person. I always think of the quote from Harry Potter: ""If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his **inferiors**, not his **equals**."" She previously saw you as her inferior. You can be cordial to her out of respect for your girlfriend, but you are by no means obligated to be her friend."
5,a2shl0,t2_17c3py3t,DataIsMyCopilot,NTA. If I were you I'd be concerned about how the girlfriend herself is as a person that she's friends with someone like that. You don't have to have the same friends. And it's not like your reasons for not being friends with this person aren't justified 
5,ad5aco,t2_15xjp2,Annie_Benlen,"NTA. I read the post twice and it's not very clear but I think the house is in your name? Or both you and your parents?

5,apq3yz,t2_q1b7igf,MrsMinnesota,Yta. Your kid shouldn't get dragged to adults dinners when they're exhausted. Get a babysitter if you want adult time and use your big boy voice to order something different if the pizza wasn't what you wanted. 
5,apq3yz,t2_161h0l,FighterWoman,"YTA for not planning ahead. Why are you eating so late, your child will sleep rather than eat with you? Children needs to sleep in a bed, not at a restaurant.

Def NTA, I can't believe she would be so disorganised."
5,b5u7l6,t2_32s49ewc,crackbaby443,NTA- my cousin sent out save the dates 6 months in advance. We have a large family sure but she didnt give anyone enough time. Shes being a bit of a bridezilla.
5,akne2c,t2_t7jblpv,pr0digalnun,"YTA. More like accidental asshole. Look at it from her perspective. It probably looks to her like you aren’t interested. And making up excuses instead of just telling her you are shy & cant dance makes it worse. Honesty always, ALWAYS, is the best policy. And truly it’s kind of endearing to hear someone say they’re nervous & have two left feet. "
5,a2xcp2,t2_jtd94,batboobies,"YTA You've essentially admitted that she's not ""working to impress you"". After four years that's not going to happen with anyone. Usually by that point a healthy relationship will have evolved into comfort, love, and personal growth. If she's still trying to impress you four years in, that would mean that she's insecure about your relationship. Secondly I think it's pretty obvious that it's all about looks here. And you're dancing around the issue like an ass. Be an adult, tell her you love her but you're having trouble feeling attracted to her. That's shitty but is a valid way to feel in a relationship. But expect her to get angry and leave you for someone who makes her feel more comfortable in her body."
5,a2xcp2,t2_7f0uq,WompyTomperson,"The exact situation is NTA and understandable but your reasoning makes you the asshole. &#x200B; You don't care about her getting healthy or her having a long life, you care about how she doesn't ""care about her image"" and ""doesn't impress you"" which is pretty ridiculous. &#x200B; > I sometimes bring it up and she tends to get mad and makes it seem like im the worst bf for even asking. &#x200B; If you used the reasoning you put in this post you'd be in the wrong, yeah. You basically turned her issue into something that's all about you and your feelings instead of what's best for her. &#x200B; Advice: If you wanna make this a reasonable argument you should really shape it into an argument where you want her to be healthy and want her to live a long life with you. You can ask her to do couples activities like bike riding, hiking, really anything that is active but also fun for two people. "
5,a2xcp2,t2_tkgkv79,illy7681,"YTA Dude, she doesn't owe you anything as far as how she treats her body. If you aren't attracted to her anymore, maybe you should break up with her. That's way more healthy and less assholish than continuing to harass her about her weight when she's already told you she doesn't like it. I know it's a rough situation to be in. Something similar happened to me with my GF. I promise this is relevant. When we first started dating she was really insistent on giving me blow jobs, even though I wasn't that concerned about it. But after a couple years she stopped, even if I expressed interest. However, for unrelated reasons, we opened up our relationship a couple months after this became an issue, and because we had agreed to be open with each other, I knew she was giving the guys she was seeing plenty of oral. So, I was angry. Because between this and some talks we had about it, she basically expressed that she had done it originally to ""impress/seduce"" me,and she clearly wanted to do the same with these guys, but apparently I wasn't worth the effort. It was not a fun revelation. We later broke up for unrelated reasons. But it wasn't because she didn't like me anymore. (I know, I know, but it's true). Our sex life was fine. The point I want to make with this anecdote is that it's her right to decide what she wants to do with her body/whatever. It's rude to harass her about it. But! If it isn't what you want from a relationship, it would not be assholish to break up with her and go look for someone who wants what you want. I'm not saying dump her. I'm saying ask yourself how you feel about her and what you want out of your relationship. Are you still getting it? Then you're probably gonna have to accept her choices. If you aren't, it may be time to loom elsewhere. I know that's a shitty choice. But it's the one you've got."
5,ah7a5m,t2_iiuqk6v,sfcfrankcastle,"YTA, I’m struggling with reasoning other than it’s something (IMO) very childish. It’s a movie you can pop it in again, clearly he likes it otherwise he wouldn’t have watched it. Also OP you’re missing out on a lot of damn good cinema, step out of your comfort zone a little, you’d be surprised at the gems out there in the movie world. Lastly...holy fuck what a random selection of movies you listed."
5,ah7a5m,t2_r1mj3,MarsNirgal,"YTA. If you are okay with him watching some movies on his own, why should he keep a tally on what movies are off-limits to watch by himself? Also, do you ever put your own movies? And your reaction to him putting on a movie when you clearly said you wanted to stay in bed is way over the top. "
5,alkbae,t2_2v8hdae8,RidleyAteKirby,"Wait, wait, wait... Let me get this straight... He was chasing your terrier mix and wailing on her? Dude deserves more than getting bit, he needs his ass whooped.

5,akjaug,t2_32ek64ix,starredandfeathered,"NTA - He really messed up by telling them about your OCD. That’s unacceptable. I mean you’re sleeping in makeup for crying out loud. I completely understand your desire to never see them again, but I don’t know how feasible it will be. How long have y’all been together, and how serious is this relationship?"
5,amih70,t2_dg0wy,ness839,"**YTA** Why did you feel obligated to say something to your manager? It sounds like you took an opportunity to get rid of a co-worker you don't like and you're engaging in some fake hand-wringing. The story makes you seem like a bit of a snake. ""I try and stay out of everything"" but you went and tattled immediately."
5,ai9yw5,t2_5o2dx,TheLadyEve,"YTA (your friend, I mean). Your husband is her employer and he has to make that decision. For all you know she really did lose messages and just make an honest mistake, but it sounds like you're a bit insecure so you're assuming the worst. As long as you trust your husband, you have nothing to worry about--so stay out of it and let him decide whether or not to continue employing her. EDIT: huh, I'm surprised I'm the only one here saying this, but I'll stand by it. OP's friend shouldn't tell her husband who he should fire. "
5,ai9yw5,t2_9u7th,zoeyversustheraccoon,"YTA It's his business, he has to work with her, seems happy with her work, and replacing people is a pain in the ass. The wife does not get to make that call. Tell him to take his phone off of silent (like how many personal texts is he really getting in a given day?) and to answer when she texts him. "
5,ai9yw5,t2_2uo9x8fg,Heyweird0,"NTA. I feel like the husband doesn’t want his wife to come by/contact the office that often and he lets the secretary be the bad guy. I’m not saying he’s doing anything immoral with his employee, but he doesn’t want to tell his wife that he doesn’t want her bothering him at work. The other scenario could be that he sucks at telling the secretary to be more respectful of his wife. Either way, he sounds like kind of a spineless weenie. "
5,a9yfco,t2_t0gra,Rivka333,"NTA. You're more sort of an idiot. In the future, either ask a female colleague to say something, or follow the good advice already given in the other comments, or keep silent. Also, the way you worded the note doesn't make it clear that you're telling her because you want her to stop putting her feet up. From the way it's written, it could sound just as likely that you're saying it to be sexual, and that you're perfectly happy about seeing her underwear."
5,a9yfco,t2_2rcpms9y,nyanyawhatsmyname,"NTA. However, you have to think about this as a female. Youre a 30 year old male and regardless it seems creepy that you've noticed that. Shes underaged and underwear on a girl is different than an unzipped zipper. "
5,a9yfco,t2_2l5ykjsn,Suomynona0000,"NTA. I don’t really understand why she and her friends think that you’re a creep. Obviously she realized her mistake (feet on desk AND a skirt) when you told her that you could see her underwear. I would understand everyone being upset if there wasn’t any context to your words, but this here doesn’t make any sense. But as everyone else in the thread is saying, please do be careful! "
5,a9yfco,t2_2031qqpo,NifflerOwl,"NTA in general, but YTA in how you told her. You should have just told her to put her feet down and if she protested you should've told her to stay after class. Also be careful with the girl, it sounds like she's trying to set you up to get fired or something. No one in a skirt would put their feet up like that unless they were trying to show someone their underwear "
5,9xuld9,t2_mk8p3,iamasecretthrowaway,"NTA. But theres a reason you're not supposed to date within your first year of sobriety and a reason you're definitely not supposed to date someone in your treatment program. I know it's rampant in 12 step programs, but it's so, so messy. Maybe they need a 12 step program for *that* :) Seriously, though, your actions don't dictate someone else's behaviour. You know that her choices are her own. What she chooses to do is on her, not on you. You're not good for eachother; it doesn't make you an asshole to accept that and end it. "
5,9xuld9,t2_2dht74ay,jepeplin,"NTA. Your sobriety is the number one thing in your life because everything else flows from it: employment, residence, family relationships, health, life. She is a danger to your sobriety. You gave her a chance to get clean, you were supportive, but it’s now to the point where you’re enabling. You’re not helping her. Cut her off and protect your sobriety."
5,9xuld9,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"NTA. Good job getting clean and while this break up is going to be hard, please stay strong in your sobriety. You did what you had to for yourself, and sometimes that's what you have to do."
5,aiyqm9,t2_zaejm,chozzie,NTA. I think you're both incompatible to be honest. She's a clinger and you can't fully commit due to needing space. You both want and need different things in a partner. Let her go find the right guy for her and you do you.
5,aiyqm9,t2_3013caup,SillyMidOff49,"NTA It’s your place dude. If she can’t respect the rules of staying at yours then she shouldn’t have unrestricted access. *Tell* her you want your day or two to yourself or else you will be taking your key back. You sound like you have been BEYOND patient with her over this, and the fact that she reacts that way when you’ve told her multiple times how you feel is emotionally manipulative, possessive and attempting to impose her will on you. You need to put your foot down. You’re supposed to be equal partners. "
5,b25zcp,t2_2wmq2tyd,annoyed68,"NTA I think she’s acting weird because she feels odd about upsetting the “status quo” (you’re not exactly her friend so it’s a weird sort of “I had a disagreement with this person that I’m not ‘friends’ with but now I still have to see them around so it’s weird.) I honestly feel like she over reacted but then again I’m not Asian so that’s probably why lol. From a K-Pop fan perspective, I hear a lot of non-K-Pop fans say stuff like “they all look the same” “they look like girls” (in reference to male K-pop idols) so she was probably a little defensive because of that as well. Before I was actually a fan of a k-POP group I have to admit I had the same issue as you. It was VERY hard for me to tell the difference between certain actors/idols etc and I’d often confuse groups or just plan forget names. You’ve already apologized and she knows you meant no harm so unfortunately the balls in her court now and you’re gonna have to wait and see how she’s gonna let this play out. Best of luck, OP"
5,agyxjf,t2_17xdk4gq,cityzombie,"So I misread, I'm doing a new comment lol. NTA. You don't reach out to him, you don't communicate with him. I'd probably limit the communication even more for the comfort of your current partner, and for the sake of leaving the past where it belongs... But it's VERY unreasonable for him to expect you to be rude to him when you do run into him. It's okay to not want an ex apart of your current life with someone, but there's no reason to expect someone to be rude to that person. That's beyond normal insecurities. "
5,agyxjf,t2_i1c4m0i,MarieAllis,"NAH. I maintain that I'm close with my ex (we dated for three years and ended on good terms like you and yours). And similiar we don't text/talk often, but we are in contact. However, there still needs to be boundaries. I can understand your current being upset he bought you a present, but he shouldn't be upset or worried that you're still in contact with him. If you haven't, I'd try sitting down with him and getting everything out. Explain your relationship with your ex and why it's important he stay in your life, and let your current bf explain his feelings towards it and ask any questions he may have. Best to clear the air. "
5,agyxjf,t2_2j75bsfh,xeropteryx,"I can't capture my answer in a pithy abbreviation. I don't think you're an asshole, BUT. If I had to bet, I'd say most cheating on one's current partner happens with an ex. Why? You still have that physical and emotional bond; you probably both still have sexual fantasies about the other person; and it's a lot easier to break that ""I shouldn't have sex with this person"" barrier because you've already had sex with them in the past. It's really, really easy to get drunk and send a ""thinking about you"" text and have things spiral out of control. Can you look deep inside yourself and know 100% that you'll never get bored and lonely because your current bf isn't physically present, and then feel tempted into inappropriate sexual or emotional intimacy with your ex? If so, then I'd say seeing your ex from time to time is okay (but I'd still be wary about the coffee and gifts thing). But if you feel like you may be tempted or like you can't be honest with yourself about this, then I'd limit contact with the ex."
5,9yzkes,t2_11ie6z,modapuckas,"NTA, this sounds some petty shit. Your neighbor did a nice thing for yall and you are doing one back. Your roommate should be happy that you actually went out of the way to get your neighbor a gift. Getting a gift for your neighbor should not make her feel insignificant(thats her own fault I literally so no way it can make her feel like that). Thanks for being a nice person though! It feels great when someone does something good for you back when you helped them out!"

That makes zero sense to me. Why would someone be angry that their neighbor did a nice thing for them? >Jessica further expressed that when I do things like that without asking it makes her feel insignificant. Okay, so I *think* I understand what she really means here. You gave a gift on her behalf. That probably makes her feel like you think *she* should have given a gift, and that you're passively-aggressively shaming her for not doing so. Or maybe she's just mad that you're putting her on the hook for paying next time, even after you've moved out. That said, her feelings of inadequacy/anger are not your fault. But it might be good to sit down and have a discussion with her to ask her what she'd prefer for you to do. Would she have said ""no"" if you asked her if you should give Daniel a gift card? Should she be able to tell you how to spend your own money, or how you're supposed to interact with your own neighbors?"

You dont go looking for love at a strip club. She stiffed you, ok move on. Searching her on Instagram, that was creepy stalker stuff. Taking it ANY further, even more so. She told you to go outside to meet her because she wanted to diffuse the situation and did not need a guy in the club assaulting her or freaking out. It happens to them. So she said what she needed to, in order to get you OUT of the club and remove the threat to her. &#x200B; So my advice, drop it, Make no further attempt to contact her. Do NOT go back to that club.

I have never and will never forget my moms response. ‘Blood just makes you related, love makes you family. Thats MY son and hes as much one of us as any of my other children. If you ever disrespect my boy again, we’re gonna have problems.’ Your boyfriends family is Italian. So as far as Im concerned so is he. "
5,b7t4ag,t2_13zeca,Violenzio,"YTA - Ok, I'm italian, a REAL italian, born from italians, that lives in italy and stuff, so I'm perfectly entitled to judge this case. Being italian is not a matter of parents or anything else: being italian is a state of mind. * Does he cheat his way in life? He's italian. * Does he consider people that eats spaghetti with meatballs and hawaian pizza uneducated sons of Satan? He's italian. * Does he love to eat a lot at lunch and considers it a holy ritual? He's italian. * Does he live by his own time, lazily and without thinking too much about consequences? He's italian. And by the way, we really don't care about cultural appropriation, so this makes him italian as well. And most importantly, why should you care? If you were italian you could have a problem with it, but I don't think it's your job to decide who is what. By the way, just to bring a perfect example on this: a friend of mine is a brazilian guy with dark skin that got adopted in an italian family when he was young. He has not even a single drop of italian blood but he speaks like a thug from the suburbs of Rome and no one would even think of him as something different than an italian. It's not your blood that decides who you are. It's your culture. &#x200B; EDIT: added some pizza, mandolino and mafia."
5,b7t4ag,t2_90nh22f,agentcoop_,"YTA. If he was raised by an Italian family in Italian traditions, then I would say that he's not really appropriating anything. While saying outright that he IS Italian would be wrong, he was still raised by a mother that was raised by Italians, it's pretty much by proxy living the culture. I don't think you're wrong either for thinking it's silly, but I don't think it's wrong that he feels connected to that culture, either. "
5,b7t4ag,t2_3fdl1w4r,Elegant-Despair,"YTA. Everyone else went over the main reasons why. But I just don’t understand why it bothers you so much. He was raised Italian and happily has lived as such his whole life. Why do you have to come in like a rain cloud and try to tell him the identity he was raised as isn’t his because it’s not in his blood? Have you thought about how doing this has effected him? And how if you were able to “convince him” he isn’t Italian, how much that could change his entire self image? It also really doesn’t hurt you in any way, heck it sounds like you get great Italian food out of it. Let it go, please. "
5,b7t4ag,t2_5hwvm,AtomicSamuraiCyborg,"YTA. &#x200B; What are you, the enforcer of Italian Blood Certificates? His family culture is Italian, because that's how his mother was raised and she raised him. He is adopted Italian, his mother is bilingual for god's sake. Blood means nothing, fool. If you were by blood Italian and raised by English, you wouldn't know how to speak the language, cook pasta and be Catholic. You'd just be a swarthy Englishman. Culture is something one learns and absorbs, which his mother and he did. "

I know that sounds cold but people like that don't get better if there is always someone showing them sympathy. If I were you, I wouldn't even consider letting him back in my life until he had the balls to apologize for what he did in the past. Also, it was kind of a huge deal that your mom didn't talk to you and your brother about it first. He caused a good deal of trauma to all of you. You should have had a say before hand. If anyone should feel guilty, it should be her for jumping the gun. I understand that she is probably just a kind and forgiving soul and she was just trying to do the right thing but you and your brother should always come first."

5,a82v1g,t2_1zcq7w8a,kakikat,"NTA is my gut reaction... but maybe detail how exactly you asked her to calm it down? calling you mean, fat, and jealous just seems like a BIT much of a reaction, when you were kinda looking out for her, since messing around with married/commited folks can get nasty. "
5,au3bx3,t2_cxmhejk,SpaceAgeHamburger,"You're NTA here. Why is your brother pressuring you to eat non-vegan food? He needs to respect your choices. You're not trying to foist your veganism on him, you're just following your beliefs. I'm unclear whether he's being a full-on jerk about this, or thinks it's funny (also a jerk move), or if he legit doesn't understand veganism. Someone needs to set him straight about what it means to respect other people's choices."
5,au3bx3,t2_2jndma6s,loggedout1,"NTA But how about next time he is going to bake ask him if you can help Then you can say I can only eat this, and add in your vegan butter.

5,au3bx3,t2_2oew7qfd,coffeeboi5006,"NTA - the kinda vegan the internet dislikes is the kind that attempts to force their view onto others. You're not saying he has to do what you want, you're just making a choice on what you want to eat, which is perfectly reasonable. He should learn to live and let live."
5,ahpwgp,t2_10to0e,MildredNatwick,"YTA, and also a sexist moron. What if your daughter, or your younger son is the one with the most interest and aptitude? What if your sons doesn’t feel like spending his life being somone’s “helper”, just because of birth order? What if none of your kids have any interest in your family business? ... Wait a minute—are your kids’ names Hela, Thor, and Loki? Do you only have 1 eye?"
5,ahpwgp,t2_mmlsel1,TheOneWhosCensored,"YTA for a few reasons. First is that they’re way too young to be making a decision on who should take it. You’re also not giving it to you’re oldest because they’re a girl, that’s wrong. If you care about your family business you’d see who wants it or does the best at it, not just give it to the oldest son. "
5,ahpwgp,t2_1esuq6k,RemmeM89,"YTA for skipping your daughter in the first place. Unless she does not have an interest in it, and unless she has some sort of disability, she is just as capable as your sons. That being said, because it is not what you asked about, yes, you are STA for telling your sons that. Just because he is the oldest does not make him the most capable, and you should not be excluding your younger son to ""brothers helper"" just because of the age."
5,ahpwgp,t2_llc6exw,ThirdAccountNow,Wow YTA. I hope your business fails and all of your children get successful without your disgusting heritage. You *are* playing favorites. You dont even know if your oldest one wants your business or will be smart enough to lead a business. Maybe your youngest has a way better business mind? You are shutting down your brain for dumbass traditions that do more harm than good. 
5,ahpwgp,t2_482ldmk,need2know25,"YTA - and you probably just made your youngest feel completely unwanted and isolated. How about the kids decide, when you are ready to hand over the business, which ones run it? Just because it was done that way to you (which is unfair) doesn't mean it should be done to your children. What if the son you want to give it to doesn't want it, or feels pressured. You've basically just decided for your child what he is going to do with his life with no say from him. This isn't something that should have even been brought up to them at their ages. I couldn't even imagine how heartbroken I would be if this was told to me as a child. "
5,ahpwgp,t2_1hr373o5,hellboyjv3,YTA: That old fashion way of running your family is dead. You should pass it on to all your sons not just the oldest. What if he doesn’t want it? You’re gonna just give it to your second oldest? No one is supposed to play “roles”. Everyone chooses what they want in life. 
5,ahpwgp,t2_11g1c5,Gamma_cleavage,"YTA. I don’t believe you, though. It’s not that dinosaurs and their little women don’t exist - in fact they are everywhere - it’s that I don’t believe for a second one of them would post this."
5,ahpwgp,t2_ilc42z6,Penya23,"YTA but I'd like some INFO as well. What happens if your oldest doesnt want that role and wants to follow his own carreer path? Are you going to be like, ""ok youngest now I will show you the ropes""? And what about your daughter? What if she wants it? Or does that not even matter because, well, vagina? I hope your daughter opens a competitive business and destroys you financially. And I also hope your kids all tell you to take your family business and choke on it."

5,b1ir50,t2_8luo0,coltomatic,"NTA - Just the comment ""…I don’t think she will mind because she probably will never get pregnant anyway."" She can go fuck herself. &#x200B; Sounds like you and your husband are better off without her in your life.

5,b4qcth,t2_4u2w6bj,Gambled4MyRangeRover,"NTA. Don't set yourself on fire to keep your sister (and parents) warm. In a form of abuse, your parents conditioned you to think this way, and don't want to take responsibility for your sister. It's quite common really. This is yet another variation of ""I thought I only had to put food in your mouth and a roof over your head, I didn't actually sign up to be a PARENT! Kids exist to go to school, not die, then be an accessory that I brag about! REEEEE!"" Like, who even says ""you're my only chance of having a normal daughter"" ? Their blatant emotional manipulation has put you between a rock and a hard place. It's going to be extremely difficult but you'll thank yourself later.

5,aplbeh,t2_36cqvz9o,Justanotherbob293,"NTA. I've been in your situation before. And it sucks because you will feel guilty for ending it with him. But when it comes to picking the person you're going to marry, you absolutely should be selfish. You can't sacrifice your happiness for him just because things are going rough for him. What I would do is sit down and explain to him that you're just not happy anymore. That you're not in love. It's ok to offer to help him for a while until he can get back on his feet. But for this to be fair for the both of you, you need to be honest to him about his feelings and then give him a chance to have time to react. It may suck for a while. But down the road, not settling will be the best decision you've made about this relationship. For the BOTH of you "
5,b0nr1c,t2_1x9ws3s9,Goddexme,"YTA. I was terrified of dogs as a young person due to being attacked. I am fine now, but large dogs I don’t know still make me wary. If my husband tried to force me to get a big dog and then dismissed my fear, I’d be pretty upset. "

You say no and he gets upset at you. It’s best to try and think of situations the other way and see if the way you are acting is the way you would want him acting towards you. 
5,b0nr1c,t2_2fvxx390,beetfarmer8,"YTA. I grew up with 2 huge dogs (150lbs.) and I was very afraid of them. They weren’t trained well and one attacked me several times: I’m talking about drawing blood and ER visits. Dogs can sense fear so the problem got worse and worse. I couldn’t enter certain rooms in my house when the dog was there. I would never ever have a big dog again. Idk where his fear of big dogs comes from, but you need to respect it."
5,b2z9uz,t2_13l4ik,Deadly9750,"YTA. First off, instead of talking about it you're giving her the cold shoulder, thats terrible. If you trust her you should allow this to happen as she won't cheat (I'm using cheat because she and you have expressed feelings about wanting to get back together) because she is honest and you trust her. Its an unfortunate circumstance. For advice I would recommend r/relationship_advice Edit: in brackets ( )"
5,b2z9uz,t2_te8lw,ren1813,"YTA. You broke up with her man, sorry to say but you lost any say you might have had in get life. Also, don't let this grow in more than it is if you really want to grey back together. Key it go. "
5,b43t53,t2_4ot72d,Safahri,"NTA if you intended for the money to help out her and your kids. If you only intended to give it to her because you 'love' your ex wife then you're a bit of an asshole (ESH) for making your current girlfriend a 'plan b'. The way she reacted was a little over the top, but to be expected since you are giving money to another woman (that you used to be married to). Otherwise, you do have kids to provide for and it's none of her business because you're not married and you don't share the money. Just a question: did she know you had a wife when you had an affair with her? Because if she did then the whole 'disrespecting her' is a load of bullshit because she did the same thing to your ex wife. edit: wow this blew up Edit 2: is this what it's like when people hijack the top comment Edit 3: thanks for the silver, guy"
5,b43t53,t2_u82k6,queenofthera,"NTA ...but what I will say, is that I think your current GF is in an unenviable position. While she's wrong to resent you giving money to the mother of your children, the way you talk *does* sound like you're still in love with your ex-wife, and that you consider cheating with your current GF as the biggest mistake of your life. Just by the way you write, it sounds like you (rightly) accept that what you did was wrong, but also that you believe you would have been happier if you'd never met your gf. If I've picked up on this, (and assuming I'm not a million miles off the mark), it's reasonable to assume your gf has too, which may explain her reaction. You were wrong to string her along for this long, especially as you now seem to feel happy she's talking about ending it. You should have broken up with her a long time ago, it seems. "
5,b43t53,t2_37co5lda,aitathrowawayx,"Personally, I think this is nuanced. NTA for giving the money to the mother of your children, therefore improving their lives immensely. Kids come first, and providing equally wonderful living situations in both homes is really a good choice IMO. However, based on the info in your post, I think there’s more to it than that - by your own words, you still love your ex wife, and want to prove something to her. While I don’t like that your GF doesn’t want you to give Ex-Wife any money, I’m not surprised by her insecurity about it and about how you still feel about Ex-Wife. So you still suck a little, but the act of improving your ex-wife’s and kids’ lives is not immoral. If your wife wanted to date you again, would you? Given the information you’ve provided about how you feel about her, I don’t really understand why you are still with your girlfriend. **I’m completely open to being wrong here**, but based on what I’ve read from your post and some comments, it kind of sounds like you’d just rather not be alone. Having an affair with your now-girlfriend was a big mistake, which cost you your marriage. But you still love your ex-wife. Are you just committed to the mistake you made, since it’s in your opinion better than being single? "
5,b43t53,t2_16h2q0,runostog,"NTA. Your a good person despite your fuckups. If this was hallmark you'd leave the GF and reunite with your Ex-WIfe haha. No, your GF is wrong to scream at you, but from her point of view it does make sense. She will never forget that she was ""the other woman"". You have proven to have a wandering eye in her eyes...it could happen again. "
5,b43t53,t2_mie2s,fujisan0388,"NTA It’s your money to do with what you like but I get the feeling you will have to spend even more on your gf to make her feel secure.

5,b43t53,t2_1in5wqg2,hoisinsauce31,"NTA. I am biased here because I am currently going through trauma due to my husband having an affair a few months with someone who knew he was married with a new baby. It isn't surprising to me that your gf would act in this way. Obviously, anyone who engages in an affair is a selfish person, so you shouldn't be surprised. But your ex and your kids deserve the world, and if you can help provide that, you absolutely should. It seems like you have been together with your gf for awhile, but it would also seem that relationships that start with affairs aren't long lasting. Your ex seems like a kind and reasonable person, and I would bet she would be open to this money going into some sort of fund for your children. So that could be a solution if you have any desire to appease your gf and salvage that. And if gf still has a problem, well then, you have some bigger decisions to make about that relationship. "
5,b43t53,t2_2welq0ry,dtothebakes,"NTA. Wealth has a way of illuminating the usually hidden core of who people are—for good or ill. You sounds like a good person. You’ve owned your role in your divorce and clearly still care for your ex-wife and kids. It makes perfect sense that you’d want to share what you’ve received with them. The money has also exposed your girlfriend’s jealous streak. But it’s not her money, it’s yours, and you’re absolutely right to put your children and their mom first."
5,b43t53,t2_5jquo,Coziestpigeon2,"YTA or NAH, I can't decide. What you're doing for your kids and ex-wife is amazing, you're absolutely NTA for that. But you're treating your current GF pretty poorly. You got something big and exciting in your life, and the first person you tell (after your parents) is your ex? That would suck, a lot. You still love your ex. That would suck, a lot, for your current GF. I don't think you're being an asshole *in general*, but I think you're being an asshole specifically towards your current partner. And I don't really think she's out-of-bounds by being hurt by the way you value your ex over her. Really, it sounds like you're just looking for permission to end your current relationship. I think you're doing the right thing, and are taking admirable actions. I also think, specifically from the POV of your current GF, you're being an asshole towards her, and are making it very clear that you value her less than your ex, which must really hurt her to realize. If you don't value your current partner, and feel relieved at the thought of breaking up with her, then just end it. You're being an asshole by continuing to drag the relationship on when you pretty clearly know what you want to do. Don't string her along just so you're not alone. "

5,b43t53,t2_13netj,Catman419,"NTA If I may suggest, instead of giving the ex a huge lump sum for the kids, consider setting up a trust for them. That way they are taken care of, and if you’re still giving the ex something, it won’t be a huge lump for her+kids.

I kind of don't think you should be in a relationship until you've dealt with your issues surrounding your wife.

5,b43t53,t2_1ax2t9ld,ja_millionaire,"NTA. If you are feeling relieved over threats of breaking up it may be time to re evaluate your relationship. I’m never one to come on Reddit and immediately go break up crazy, but considering you just got a ton of money, you probably should be sure you’re spending it on someone you know you want to be with. "
5,b43t53,t2_ojibhxp,Lethal-Muscle,"NTA. This is ridiculous and makes it sound like your GF would get mad if you gave extra money on top of child support for things like school clothes or books. You are looking out for your children, and being an amazing parent by doing this. It sounds like you and your ex are doing a great job parenting. Keep that up!"
5,b43t53,t2_2uhsibx4,PhoebeReeves25,"NTA. Your reasons are perfectly valid. You want to help the mother of your children give them a better life. You want to help her and your kids to develop and better their future. This has nothing to do with romance. I can see why your gf would freak out but she needs to realise that your family are your first commitment. And your ex , being the mother of your kids, is part of that family you made. Your choice to support your family is not an asshole move."
5,b43t53,t2_s4t3yj3,Chloe_baxter5,"NTA, you're takomg care of your kids first and foremost by taking care of and maintaining a mature relationship with their mom. Frankly your gf is not only a disrespectful homewrecker (as were you), but she is immature. I would honestly question marrying or going any further with this chick where she could get her hands on this money. Don't get her pregnant. "
5,b43t53,t2_koiy4vr,loveshotbaths,"NTA Its your money. You can do what you want with it. On a side note, your ex wife isn't a saint for allowing you to see your kids. You have just as much right to see them as she does. If she had denied you that would have been wrong on multiple levels. Thats what stuck out to me about your post the most"
5,b43t53,t2_2kr7hax3,daworldismyclassroom,Nta! Congratulations on your win. Well done for giving your ex some of it. It a noble act. She sounds like a saint! You will bring tears of joy to her eyes and really show her how her goodness has not passed unnoticed! Ignore the current GF's tantrum. 
5,b43t53,t2_6pgtmgv,wcmj,"NTA. Just for the fact that _you_ won the lottery, you can give her 100% of your money and it’s still NTA. Your gf has her right to be upset, but you’re entitled to spend the money however you want, so still not an asshole. Also I can feel that you’re a respectable man. Your ex-wife sounds like a woman with a lot of compassion and grace as well. I just sincerely hope you both have a good life - separately or together - either way, live well!"
5,b43t53,t2_cqnuci,FloatingPencil,"NTA - unless you're planning on making yourself and your current partner short of money by doing this, I'm not sure why your girlfriend even cares. When you win that sort of money, part of what you win is the ability to gift the people in your life with security. It sounds as though you can do this and still live like a king! Honestly, the attitude of your girlfriend is a major, major red flag, and I'd seriously recommend rethinking that relationship."
5,b43t53,t2_1yfz9r4,foxylipsforever,NTA. You're not just giving the money to an exwife but the mother of your kids. It's to benefit them living better. I think it's wonderful you would do that. So many ex's (men and women) alike would be like fuck them regardless of the kids. Your gf on the other hand is TA. If you ever thought about marrying her I'd reconsider or make a prenup because that is already money hungry attitude. (I can't imagine millions myself other than a big smile!)
5,b43t53,t2_3183pa3d,gonzothegreater,NTA. I sounds to me like you are doing the right thing for the right reasons. My guess is your gf is jealous of your ex because she will never be what your ex was to you. I'm not gonna say you should break up with your gf but I would take a step back and evaluate things. Be careful with your money with you gf until things settle down.
5,b43t53,t2_2f73cel5,violetcandy86,NTA. Your kids are more important than your gf's ego. She has no right to complain; she knew you had a wife and kids when she went into a relationship with you and to have that much ill-will towards your ex shows how insecure she is. 
5,b43t53,t2_bctob8k,LemonFly4012,"NTA because you have kids together. The kids' benefit comes above all else. If you didn't and she was just your ex, it'd be a different story. But considering your history together, I think you're doing a great retribution to your family and children. Best of luck to you!"
5,b43t53,t2_f9b16,eXistenceLies,NTA. It's your money. You do as you please with it. If I was in your boat I would probably do the same thing. I wouldn't want the mother of my kids working a crappy job and not be able to give kids things they'd enjoy. Why not share your winnings and have your kid's mother enjoy being a mother without the stress of a low paying job. Now your GF on the other hand sounds immature/jealous. Hopefully she isn't half your age + 7 years is she?
5,b43t53,t2_7ftygp3,sarrrwhite,"NTA. As someone who has separated parents (since I was around 4) who cannot stand each other, I think its incredible that you still appreciate and respect your ex, especially since you acknowledged shes a good mother. Anyone with half a brain should realize you're giving her this money to help her (and by extension you) raise your kids. "
5,b43t53,t2_9kszq,They-Call-Me-Taylor,"NTA. Money has a way of getting people to reveal parts of their nature that they normally keep hidden. You've now seen the nasty, jealous, greedy side of your current GF reveal itself to you. Your ex just further confirmed what you already knew about her: she is a great person and thought of your kids first and that was all. You sound like a decent person too. You made mistakes but you owned up to it, are now living with it, and maintain respect for your ex which is SO important for your kids to see. Anyway, you did nothing wrong here (far from it) and the only asshole here is your GF."
5,b43t53,t2_21mo3yfx,wwwooowwwzzzaaa,NTA For wanting to give money to your ex wife. I would almost find it weird if you didn't to be honest. However.. ESH because you obviously don't love your girlfriend. I am sure she feels that and this is part of where her anger is from.
5,b43t53,t2_2cldpg3f,Urcaaes,"NTA - honestly man it sounds like you’re just trying to be a good dad. I’ve got a friend who’s dad is SUPER well off and his mom isn’t quite as much, and his dad is a complete dick about it. For a while he tried to buy his was back into his sons (my friend) life by trying to give the kid money and nice stuff and it just made everyone not like him, even me. Good on you, do right by your kids "
5,b43t53,t2_33whh3kb,_922_,"NTA that money will (I hope and assume) be used for the betterment of your kids’ lives. That’s money she can use for nicer clothes for them, college, a bigger house if she wants, more activities etc. If you didn’t have kids together my answer would be different but she’s the mother of your children and that money will end up benefiting them. Also your girlfriend has no legal claim to that money so it’s not up to her what you do with it. "
5,b43t53,t2_2gqwr00p,Amethysttortuga75,"NTA, at this moment in time. You were when you cheated and ripped your family apart but you seem like you want to be a better person. It is amazing that you want to help your ex , she deserves it. What you also need to do is find a new girlfriend. That would be another great improvement."
5,b43t53,t2_k379c,Anthraxious,"NTA - Your current gf has issues or is a greedy fuck. If they can't understand why you're doing it after you've explained it (and you are truthful in your words) then fuck it. Either ignore her or dump her. I guarantee that if she's upset now, she will bring it up in the future as something you did as ""proof"" you don't truly love her or something."
5,b43t53,t2_5td54,LilyOfTheBurbs,"NTA your ex wife clearly has a special place in your heart and life. its natural to want to share your wealth with her, especially since your ex and children are very much a part of your life. if your gf wants to leave over that, let her. "
5,b43t53,t2_iojlt,GimmeMuchosMangos,"NTA. You’re awesome to be doing this for your ex. Your gf needs to grow up. Not to shit on you, but she’s the type of girl that involved herself with a married man. Are you really going to listen to her? At least you’re trying to learn from your mistake and do something about it. "
5,b43t53,t2_170y9m,Whatever0788,"NTA. She’s the mother of your children, and still taking care of your children. I’m not saying she necessarily *deserves* it, but it sounds like she’s been through quite a bit and could certainly benefit from the money, as would the kids. If your girlfriend is honestly threatening to break up with you over this, then I’d say she’s probably not worth it. I mean, you ruined your marriage for her and she’s really going to be upset if you want to help out the woman you left for her? Not to mention helping out your kids? Does she not care about your kids at all? Because it kind of doesn’t sound like she does, which would be a pretty big deal breaker if I was in your position. "
5,b43t53,t2_csolu,UglierThanMoe,"NTA It's YOUR money, so you can do with it as you please. Giving some to your wife and kids sounds like a very decent thing to do, so kudos for that. The only thing that's worrying is your GF. To be honest, her going mental because you want to give YOUR money away is a red flag of gigantic proprtions. Get your lawyer involved to make sure that matter what happens, your ex wife and your kids are cared for."
5,b43t53,t2_6drof1u,TopHatLookin,"NTA. &#x200B; If I may offer some advice in how you phrase the term of your ex-wife, I find it can make a difference in how things come across. &#x200B; Don't refer to her as your ex, or ex-wife etc. Refer to her as the mother of your children. You are giving money to the mother of your children. Your kids will view this so positively. &#x200B; Many people may disagree with this sentiment of mine, but as soon as you have children you may like it not but you are family. You are a family of of 2 kids, with separated parents. It's still a family. "
5,b43t53,t2_37e3rbsv,ToastedMaple,"Yta. Why aren't you breaking it off with your affair gf and trying to work shit out with your ex wife? You don't have to get back together, but you also shouldn't stay with someone who's screaming at you about supporting your kids. "
5,b43t53,t2_2itggwp9,Hedgehogsm8,"NTA. at all. You are great for doing this. Cheating is never excusable at all in my opinion BUT you can always be redeemable. This is an amazing move on your part and she deserves the money, especially as this will also go towards your kids in the future And I completely get what you mean at the end. You can love a person and not be in love with them. This is a respectable thing"
5,b43t53,t2_8p3vmfj,GekidoTC,"NTA, holy shit. If you are friendly with your ex why not give her some money? Its directly benefiting your children and showing them you care about their mom. What a great example to show to your kids! And your GF... she gets to see first hand how great you treat a mother of your kids, but instead of thinking ""this is how great he would treat me in the same situation"" she thinks it's a bad thing? Fuck that lady. Seriously."
5,b43t53,t2_11yghb,ThanksToDenial,"NTA. Your money, your choice. and honestly, giving some to the mother of your children is a good deed in my eyes. It'll make their lives better. I'm assuming your girlfriend doesn't have Kids, and she is clouded by jealousy, so she doesn't see how that money would help your children. Whatever the case may be, you sound like a good father. As to how to react to your girlfriends outburst on This matter... You can try to explain how that money would help your kids, and by giving some of it to your ex you are making their lives better and Easier. That puts the Ball in Her side of the court. Either she chooses to understand, or doesn't. And ofcourse, there is the option of breakup, and reddit is very fond of telling People to do so. But that is also your choice. "
5,b43t53,t2_2z9sqjh4,dramallama1986,"Absolutely 1000% NTA. You sir are a good human being. Yes you cheated, yes you fucked up. BUT the difference between you and a hell of a lot of other people is that you owned up to it. As a result you still have a great relationship with her and you see your kids. Your GF sounds like she has a lot of growing up to do. That money you won and the part you want to give to your ex will also benefit your kids greatly. Congratulations on winning!"
5,b43t53,t2_3c4tq0ag,StockRedditUsername1,"NTA. My mom is your ex wife in every sense of the word except literal. If your girlfriend doesn't understand that it is possible to have different kinds of love for multiple different people, maybe she's worth dumping. You have fuck you money. Tell her to go fuck herself. If she wants to stick around, it'll be because of the money. "
5,b43t53,t2_2lkk0j42,parahex1066,"NTA it’s funny how money changes people, isn’t it? Your girlfriend was so down with you doing what you did to your ex (not being mean, I’m just saying she was happily complicit) and now it’s a problem when you want to try and make it right? You’ll probably find that this money changes your current girlfriend in more ways than just this. Watch what happens when she suggests an expensive trip and you say no - I bet it is the same level of rage and threats. Do not be bullied man. You’re doing the right thing, ultimatums involving money are never a positive or understandable thing. "
5,b43t53,t2_2el2fbeg,that_was_me_ama,YTA - for questioning what you can and can’t do with your money. by the way your ex definitely deserves a very big piece of your pie. You literally fucked her life over. Money won’t fix what you did. But at least make her life comfortable moving forward. 
5,b43t53,t2_qhcoe,Laquila,"NTA. You're a good person and a good father. Your girlfriend's unreasonable reaction is not surprising since big money does weird things to many people. There's probably a lot of greed behind her reaction, her not wanting anyone else to get any money, plus jealousy and insecurity. The fact that the money will benefit your kids should overshadow any perceived idea that ""some other woman"" is getting your money. If she wants to break up with you over this, then let her go. Don't let her guilt you into changing your plans. In my opinion, her reaction is a bit of a red flag. Her claiming you're ""disrespecting"" her is very hypocritical, since she knew you were married when you started your affair. She showed a shitload of disrespect to your ex-wife and mother of your children."
5,b43t53,t2_e78yqse,bladezwng,"NTA, for the money part That money is to make you're kids life better. she's the homewrecker so she has no say. Side note- cant believe you're with the woman you destroyed a good marriage with. "
5,b43t53,t2_2rm5xj2c,Tondropper186,"NTA and I’d say you are a good dude. We all make mistakes, we all fuck up. Giving her 20 million won’t change the past, but it’s a wonderful thing to do. The girlfriend is obviously jealous, and that’s kind of to be expected, but it’s your money your decision. I applaud you for thinking about giving your ex wife money, you have my respect and admiration. Oh and as a divorced parent ( I’m remarried) I understand what you mean about still loving her but not being in love with her. People that aren’t in your shoes won’t get that. You aren’t an asshole for this. You are a good dude and a great dad. "
5,b43t53,t2_hy04a,PaleAsDeath,"NTA You seem like a genuinely good person OP, even if you have had fuckups in the past. Your money is yours to do what you want with it, and I think any reasonable person would agree that giving some to your co-parent so they and the kids can enjoy more stability is a great thing (and imo the responsible thing) to do. Your girlfriend, on the other hand, seems kinda gold-diggery, like she wants your winnings to be her winnings or something, or at the very least she wants you to be petty and spiteful towards your ex. Also the fact she would engage in an affair with a dude while knowing he was married seems like maybe she is not the best kind of person. I know you didn't ask for this advice...but maybe you should find a new gf."
5,b43t53,t2_d9jvxco,Nettwoel,NTA. From what I read it sounds like you did a horrible thing to your ex wife and now you are trying to make it somewhat right. I respect you for giving your ex all that money because ultimately it will benefit your children as well. Your current gf has no right in telling you what to do with this money especially when it seems she's just jealous and can't understand the history between you and your ex wife
5,b43t53,t2_2wlgc0tp,nattatalie,"NTA. If it was just some random ex girlfriend it would be different, but she is the mother of your children. It will also make it more fair for her because she won't feel like you can give the kids things she can't. If you didn't share this money with her your kids might notice things were more comfortable when they are with you and it could cause issues. Honestly, I think you're a good dude for wanting to do this. Sure, you should NOT have cheated on your ex in the first place, but this is a good thing you want to do, and if you gf can't see that, she's the asshole. "
5,b43t53,t2_2np9c10z,petret1,NTA leave your current gf bro honestly that type of negativity isn’t needed in your life. Your kids deserve there mum and with that money you just helped your kids have a bright and happy future. Since she’s making threats simply reply “lmao your my gf not my wife so you ain’t getting a sent if you’re gonna keep chucking these threats”. Gtfo of that relationship ASAP.
5,b43t53,t2_2xb9u0ce,adams_laura,"NTA at all!!!! Your story sounds a lot like my parents, and I can tell you, please, PLEASE do as you said you would. You could make her life better and your children lives better as well. Your girlfriend will get over it and if she doesn't too bad. "
5,b43t53,t2_2avq4hk3,vertigoedge,"NTA - It's such a decent thing to do. It seems you've grown as a human being and own up to mistakes made. BWAHAHAHA!! on your girlfriends threat to break up with you. You're worth millions now, so that's an empty immature threat. Let your girlfriend break up with you if that's the path she wants. Actually, since you're feeling relieved over her threats, you can always break it off with her."
5,b43t53,t2_2qoodk6q,Adiamyna,"NTA, you're a good dad. And it sounds like a good man who made one horrible mistake. Enjoy your new money, make sure to save a lot of it so you can maintain that nice life ( I know someone who didn't and ended up declaring bankruptcy a few years later)"
5,b43t53,t2_amtrpd5,motzzart,NTA . Run from your GF. And I understand that she feels threaten by your wife. But that can be deal with as a couple if you both are willing to. You haven't married her. And you are Lucky to have a good person as an ex-wife. Your kids are the winners here. Everyone can be a winner if your GF want to be part of the happy family. It will be her lost not your if she doesn't put on her part. 
5,b43t53,t2_blb69qb,Anuri_DnD,"There are a couple of details missing to be decisive, but I'd say NTA. First of all you said you won quite a bit, so I am assuming that given the money to your ex-wife and kids probably did not hurt you or your gf in the bit?! On top of that, as many other commenters already pointed out, it is never wrong to support your kids.In the contrary, you *would be the jerk* if you didn't. Secondly, how long do you already live with your gf? If she has any claim to the money at all then because you guys are common law, I mean after all **you** won it not her. And what you do with your money is all up to you. The only thing that shreds a bit of bad light onto you is that you are in a relationship with your gf even though the threat of her breaking up with you makes you feel relieved. I know you claim not to be in love with your ex wife anymore but reading through your post it seems that you care more for her than for your gf. Be a man and break up with your gf, if you rally don't have feelings for her anymore. Although I admit that the timing is not the best now, as it will seem like you stayed wit your gf for financial reasons and now that you have the cash you don't need her anymore (not implying that is what you actually feel, just saying it might look like it). Still it is still the right thing to break up with a partner you no longer have romantic feelings for."
5,b43t53,t2_11khd1mi,notlikelyevil,"NTA assuming the percentage is reasonable, we had this discussion the other day. If I won enough money that I and my GF could be set up for life, the next thing I'd do is pay all my exe's (a nice person) debts and her house off etc.. She was cool with it. To my GF it reinforces that I will always treat her well . &#x200B; Now say you give most of it to the ex, that would be different. &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B;"
5,b43t53,t2_3f0aytnr,coloradomoney,"NTA! I think it's your money and if you want to give some to your ex-wife that is not only your prerogative. If your current partner isn't happy with your decision that's actually a giant red flag and hopefully she decides to break up with you, but she probably won't since you have money now! ***TREAD CAREFULLY MY FRIEND*** "
5,b43t53,t2_36pnb,cerebus19,"NTA : You're a good father and an unselfish human being. Your girlfriend, not so much. If your ex-wife weren't the mother of your kids, your gf might have a legitimate reason to be angry, but with the situation as it is, she's acting like a brat. If she leaves you over this, you should consider yourself lucky to be rid of her."
5,b43t53,t2_2kpxvef3,SnowyBug,"NTA Your money. Do what you want. I think it's pretty awesome that you're doing this for your ex and the kids and actually considering them as well, as you should. There will be a substantial amount left over for you and your girlfriend to play around with and live off of. For her to react like this is immature. Even if you had no kind feelings towards your ex, you still would owe it to your kids to make sure they're taken care of, which would most likely lead to the same result of you giving her a nice sum of money for the care of the kids. (If it leaves her free to spend more time with the kids and work less, then the kids benefit greatly.) You're doing the right thing here. As far as your girlfriend goes, if she leaves you over this, then that's on her."

I think its great that you want to help her out by being generous with your money as well, I don't think many people would do that.

INFO how old are you and how old is your gf"
5,b43t53,t2_2ei1pjk3,bre875,NTA. Ditch the gf. If she had a good heart she would be ok woth this. This is the mother of your children who has been through hell and your gf had a heavy hand in this. Giving her this money and opportunity is the least you could do. You’re a good man for this. 
5,b43t53,t2_172lsh,issitohbi,"NTA. In fact, I think this shows just what kind of people you and your current girlfriend are. You’re taking responsibility for something you ruined & doing well to recognize how that hurt someone; this shows you have good intentions with this overall. That you’re doing it because you care. Your girlfriend is failing to own up to her part in ruining a marriage, failing to recognize that there are children involved, and focusing herself when you probably have enough money to focus on everyone. The fact that’s she’s threatening to break up with you over this shows that she’s an asshole through & through."
5,b43t53,t2_eld8b,Desertbell,"NTA. In fact, I would go so far as to say that you are a good man at your core, affair aside. And your ex seems like a classy, tough, and kind person. Also, if the thought of breaking up fills you with relief, you are way past the point where you should let that relationship go. You don't have to stay with her to punish yourself for cheating or to prove you've changed by having a ""stable"" relationship. Ditch her, take care of your family, and don't blow through all that money at once. "
5,b43t53,t2_108od2,benjyk1993,"NTA - I don't think giving money to a single mom with two kids to help them out is reptehensible behavior. And I don't want to sound like one of those people that immediately jumps to ""dump em"", but I would think long and hard about whether you want to spend a significant amount of time with someone who is going to scream and shout because you wanted to do something nice for someone. One reason I love *my* wife so much is because, if we're out eating and I want to give someone a tremendous tip, she's 100% of the time on board with it. We love to give and be enriched by people's happiness. It sounds like you do too. Does she?"
5,b43t53,t2_20r3seoi,-BoBaFeeT-,"NTA Your girlfriend needs to understand that your kids are more important than her, and they deserve a good life. And therefore by simple logic, if your ex is the one helping you to facilitate that good life, she deserves one as well.

5,b43t53,t2_2qsdpvk3,banana0vanna,NTA disregard your girlfriend and keep on with your plan if she leaves you over it let her. It's an amazing thing when you can still be civil after a divorce and it sounds like you would really be helping your ex wife out.
5,b43t53,t2_16q63a,E404_User_Not_Found,"NTA - giving your ex money will benefit your kids just as much as it will benefit her. Your kids are, well, kids. I don't know how old they are but think back when you were young. If you had to spend time between your mom and dad and one lived middle class and the other had all the cool toys which one would your young mind prefer? You don't want your kids preferring one of you over the other because of something dumb like money. Also, money makes people change. _A lot_ of money can change people. Please, please, please make sure all the money you won is _yours_ and your current girlfriend has no control or ownership of it. It would not automatically make your girlfriend a bad person, I don't know her and don't want to judge her, but there's a chance she's more mad about you having less money that she can use than you giving your ex money. Just a thought. Kind of off-topic; you seem like a great guy who happened to fuck up. It happens. I'm glad you've overcome it and you're willing to do something incredible to prove you've changed and to continue saying you're sorry."
5,b43t53,t2_59xnazt,chimchimboree,"NTA. You fucked up, you’re giving her a better life not because you’re in love with her but as something of a payback without expecting love or anything in return. Plus, she can give your kids a healthy and happy life on her side now. "

5,b43t53,t2_34lijbra,Randibug91,NTA. You won the money not your gf. Since she is raising your children I feel like you did something amazing If your girls friend is mad that you have some money away after apparently winning millions then that just proves how greedy she is. If you want to piss her off even more you can send me a few thousand so I can catch up on the bills. Lol. Jk.. kinda 
5,b43t53,t2_d5ev6,thekyledavid,"NTA, you care about someone who you did wrong, do you tried to make amends. Nothing wrong with that. Also, this is probably not my place to say, but if I were you, I’d give serious consideration to if I want to stay with your new girlfriend. She sounds like trouble to me, and a bit of a money-grubbed who might try to do you dirty to get a cut of your money."
5,b43t53,t2_1pr5dcza,GladReason,"NTA. 'A man who doesn't take care of his family is not a man' - Don Corleone. Joking aside, hats off for being such a mature person. Perhaps you could ditch the woman you broke up for family for and get back together with them. She doesn't sound too much of a catch.."
5,b43t53,t2_qy1m8mg,imbrownbutwhite,"Sounds like YTA because of the clear conflict of feelings. You cheated on her with the one woman, then basically reverse cheat again by giving her money and saying these things about still loving her. I think you need to figure out where your feelings lie for these two individuals and get that worked out. "
5,b43t53,t2_b465d,Arvidex,"NTA for what you described in your post but It’s understandable that your gf is mad. You should maybe have talked to her before making a decision, even if that would have never changed your mind, just showing her respect by talking to her about you intentions and hearing her side wouldn’t (probably) hurt. Also, ask your ex if she even wants that money. A lot of money greatly changes people lives and you need to be able to handle it. It’s very easy to fall down the wrong path, so be careful! Both you and your ex!"
5,b43t53,t2_1ibz3jtz,goodatbeingaverage,"NTA. I think it’s really commendable that this even crossed your mind. I also think you’re right that if you didn’t do this it would really shift the paradigm of your kids lives, having one very wealthy parent and one not-so-wealthy parent. Despite obvious past mistakes, you sound like a good person"
5,b43t53,t2_x9mt6,AeternusDoleo,"NTA - You're trying to make life better for your kids. I find it very suspect that your current partner objects to your distribution of *your* wealth. Smells of someone who wants to control your finances. Those do not make the best long term partners. Perhaps something to keep in the back of your mind. Imho, if she does leave you over this, nothing of value will have been lost. Harsh, but there you go."
5,b43t53,t2_d1g19,tanoren,"NTA. ""You left her for me and now won't give ME the money! REEEEE"" Is what I'm getting from your gf. I cant see anything good from your new girlfriend now considering that and the fact she was willing to sleep with a married man and destroy the marriage and now wants to have her cake and eat it too. Based on her response I'm shocked you realized you fucked up only to divorce and keep dating your side ho, when you seem to still love your ex wife. Y'all could have worked it out unless it was her who couldn't handle looking at you because you can't stay committed. You are not ""disrespecting"" your current girlfriend. You and your current girlfriend horribly disrespected your ex wife and I think she knows it. I hope your wife used that money to get a better life than you're apparently leading. Good on you on that front. Let her break up with you over money, she obviously wasn't a good person from the start. Especially if she herself doesn't have kids, she won't understand. She has no empathy at all for your ex wife. "
5,b43t53,t2_s6h2m,kriahfox,"NTA. Idk how much you've talked about commitment, but Someone taking care of your kids > Someone you're dating. It's dangerous to give money on a person-by-person basis with a ""fuck you"" amount of money (I remember seeing a very good reddit post about what to do with a billion dollars) so I'm not surprised your girlfriend got mad. However, she is someone who dated someone who was married, so I'm not surprised at the level of immaturity. Don't cheat, OP."
5,b43t53,t2_tojht,wo0topia,"NTA - But I do have a question. Why aren't you still in love with your ex wife? You married her, had kids, then fucked up and had an affair. She divorced you in a relatively painless way and has ""done you right"" the whole time.....so why aren't you still in love with her? To me it seems you tried to turn your love off because she wanted the divorce. You can't turn love off. To me it seems like you're more connected to and trusting of her than your current gf. I suspect you being with your current gf is a sunk cost fallacy doing work. ""If I don't stay with this woman then I fucked my marriage for nothing, I wouldnt ruin my marriage for a fling"". I could be wrong, but I'd encourage you to really think about if maybe you are denying yourself the truth."
5,b43t53,t2_190j42zu,clitorophagy,"NTA It was the of course thing to do, obviously. more about your love for the kids and respect for her judgement and parenting than romance Lucky for you this episode shows your girlfriend's true colors. Having children with you is likely to intensify her jealousy "
5,b43t53,t2_1396mi,Lunarp00,"NTA. Your girlfriend is probably acutely aware that if it were not for her you would probably still be married to your wife. She probably believes that you would prefer to have never been caught and stayed married to your wife. But that's really her own problem because this is the situation you both chose to put yourself in. OP, do you actually love your girlfriend? Like her? Or are you stuck in a ""sunk cost fallacy"" where if you and your girlfriend are not together then you destroyed your marriage for nothing? &#x200B;"
5,b43t53,t2_2q2vv2o2,TheOrdinaryNWa,"Money makes people crazy, and a ton makes people insane. You are NTA. You are giving your kids the best outcomes on both side. Not to mention your gf has no say in it, legally. You guys aren't married. I myself don't understand her frustrations. I think I'd be surprised by it, but I don't think I would be angry. I will say, it seems like she expects some of it, that what that reaction tells me. If she follows through with your threat, let her. Your dating life just got more complicated, but you got the money to spare."
5,b43t53,t2_382p0zll,witchyypixiee,NTA. She is the mother of your children and I believe your decision is the best one. It is selfless. You know its the right one and if your girl isnt on board maybe she isnt the one for you. Or she needs to step back and understand a bit more. Good for you!!
5,b43t53,t2_2jzu6eon,petarob,"NTA. So basically your ex-wife has more respect for you than your current gf? Your ex-wife didn’t do the money grubbing thing, but you gf did? Your parents can see you point of view, but you gf can’t? Hhhmmm. I think you see the problem here. You’ve even admitted you’re relieved that current gf is threatening to break up. You know what to do. Advice for what it’s worth - ask your lawyer about putting the money into a trust for your wife and kids. You actually don’t want to turn off your kids growing need to be independent and make their own way in the world. Spoiling them with gobs of money can do that. Good luck! Give us an update?"
5,b43t53,t2_9cdmh,captainstormy,"NTA. I will say that your GF is right that you still love your ex wife. I mean in your post there you said you still love her twice. Wanting to take care of your kids and their mother is admirable in my book, no matter the situation. That said, to be honest I think you are doing your current girlfriend a disservice. It kind of sounds like she is a plan B in your life and that you still love your ex wife. That's just the way it seems to me though, all I know is what you wrote there. "
5,b43t53,t2_1yps03wy,HereWeGoAgainTJ,"YTA. Money won't change the fact that you cheated on the mother of your two children. Up the child support, put some money aside in a trust, get some life insurance, and get a lawyer. I'm assuming she knew you were married and still slept with you. You worded it wrong and she's pissed she's not getting exclusive access to your resources, time, and energy. Check if you live in a common law marriage state and CYA. "
5,b43t53,t2_h05hv,gingerneko,"NTA. This is the mature and kind thing to do. I commend you for doing it. A person you're dating does not have a say in it. Your report of her response is... let's say, indicative of selfishness and leave it at that. I also think it is a serious red flag. It isn't her money. It's yours."
5,b43t53,t2_ci0zb,mrfeeny666,"NTA- It’s your money, use it when you need it! Call J.G..... oh wait I mean, it’s your money use it how you want to. Don’t let your trifling ass girlfriend try to dictate how you use the money that you won. If I ever got that much money I know 10 people that are getting at least a mil right off the bat and if my gf/wife tried to say a word about it they’d be gone. No need for greed when you have more than enough, especially if you know anything about investing. "
5,b43t53,t2_nc103,Crapshait,"NTA Congrats man, I hope you and your ex have happy lives. But don't forget to have a daily routine, if you don't, you most likely will either spend all of it in a short amount of time since you arent really doing anything else or become severely depressed and a shut in. Also, people who know about this will treat you differently. Including family."
5,b43t53,t2_1u5h3jlt,ToTapOrNotToTap69,"don’t kid yourself, your still a fuck up for what you did to her. But, you absolutely are doing a very kind, generous, and thoughtful act by giving her some money. NTA in the slightest man. Your gf shouldn’t even know about it honestly cause now she probably expects some of the money for her as well. sorry but fuck what your gf thinks here and do what you think is right in your heart. "
5,b43t53,t2_2dt9xldb,imostlytakeLs,NTA A fathers goal should always be to provide for his kids and that’s exactly what you’re doing You’re current gf sounds awful if I’m being honest
5,b43t53,t2_3c76rans,kynaus07,"Definitely NTA. A good man makes a decision like this, one that is mature enough to know that this decision will benefit not only her but his own children as well. I hate that your gf cant see that. Does she have any children? If so then she really SHOULD be able to see that what you are doing is such a great and selfless thing. If she doesnt, well then yes I see that she might be like ""well that sucks"" for a bit but when she cooled off and actually thought about it a bit more then maybe just maybe she will understand. If not then call it what it sounds like you are leaning towards with the comment about the threats she making not really bothering you that much. Seriously if her threats are not scaring you in the least or at least making you panic thinking what will you do without her then just let it fizzle. Its not worth the heartache later. Start fresh and new! Buy you a new girl!!!!! Lol JOKE people, before you all slaughter me.....joke! Anyways, I agree with you though that you are making the right decision. I get what you mean about her being the mother of your children and loving her still but not in love with her. My ex-hubby is my best friend. He is the one I would call if shit went south real quick in my life or if by chance I got lucky like you and hit the lottery!!! Hes my kids father and will always be someone I love and respect and if I decide to date someone thats something they would have to be ok with. So again.....NTA!!!"
5,b43t53,t2_lpbcxj0,Grumpy_Roaster,"Of course you are an arsehole. Except that now you're a rich arsehole trying to buy forgiveness. YTA for cheating. YTA for stringing this gf along for 6 years while gushing about your ex wife. YTA for not using trusts etc to structure the money for your kids in their names, paid in instalments from the interest. YTA for trying to buy forgiveness from your kids and the ex you thirsty af for YTA for thinking this money (which you didn't even earn) will solve everything "
5,b43t53,t2_yomja,GamingNomad,"NAH. NTA because you're helping out your children, but your girlfriend isn't really wrong to be angry because you're portraying this as a gift to someone you love, and she -understandably- doesn't accept this as innocent. I don't know if anyone has mentioned this, but I think you need to rethink how guilty you feel, because that kind of guilt can make you do things you regret. Forgive yourself."
5,b43t53,t2_hoe7bkd,physioworld,"NTA, however I think it would be reasonable to also give your gf a sizeable amount of money (if for no other reason than that you'll know she's not with you just for the money, because she already has a load of money) because otherwise it kinda sends the wrong message. But no, i think in principle giving your ex a bunch of money makes all the sense, I can understand your gf's reaction although it's a little excessive."
5,b43t53,t2_2qergohx,ClearestBlueArticuno,NTA You’re an asshole for cheating but you know that. “Give our kids a better life between us” this right here is especially the reason you’re making the right choice. Your girlfriends the asshole for having an affair with a married man and being upset that you’re trying to help out the mother of your kids that you clearly love. 
5,b43t53,t2_18yyoq,happytre3s,NTA- you've got an awesome coparent and 2 kids who deserve the world. You're gf should see that you're doing what's right for your kids and get over herself. Also if you're relieved the gf is threatening a breakup- why are you with her? That's not typically the emotion someone would feel if a relationship with someone they are in love with is in jeopardy...
5,b43t53,t2_kohnio3,Artsy_Foxy,"NTA in this specific instance, but, dude.... you are otherwise the asshole. While your girlfriend should chill that you have given money to support your children you don't seem to realize how much of an asshole you are for A: Still dating the woman you cheated on your ex wife with despite ""still loving"" her. B: Dating anyone while still in love with someone else. So, while not technically a dick for donating the money, you seem like a general asshole and this situation sucks for your gf and ex wife."
5,b43t53,t2_23jg9myf,Account_Expired,"Nta You seem to be largely interested in having the money used on the kids Give her the money, but have your lawyer set it up so that the money /has/ to be used on the kids (college, first car, food, etc.)"
5,b43t53,t2_10a7ro,clekas,"NTA. You two have children together. Your girlfriend needs to understand that children change the equation. If both parents are good parents who are present in the children's lives, but one is very wealthy, while the other struggles to get by, it can create a ton of problems. For that reason alone, sharing the money with your ex-wife makes a ton of sense. "
5,b43t53,t2_21frwxhb,IamTheDarkAgent,"YTA - But not for the money... &#x200B; You fucked up that marriage and six years later you're still with the side piece all the while you feel like this about the ex-wife? Grow-up, put on some man pants and stop slumming. You could have spent 6 years getting your shit together and proving to her that you can be the partner she deserves. &#x200B; And yeah your gf is an Asshole right along side of you..."
5,b43t53,t2_flpkw,MegaHashes,"NTA. You’re not married. It’s your money to do what you want with. I’d setup trusts for the kids that pay out to the mom until they are 18 rather than just give a huge lump sum, personally. Sudden influxes of extremely large amounts of money are extremely destabilizing to people’s lives, and not always in a good way. I know that seems counter intuitive, but lots of people end up in worse circumstances after winning large lotteries. In any case, before making any final decisions on what to do, find a certified financial planner, tel them your goals and get an idea of what ALL your options are. It’s always best to know what your possibilities are before taking action. "
5,b43t53,t2_175x0h3f,Heckin-Bamboozled,"NTA. You're doing it not only for your ex wife but also for your kids. I think your girlfriend is just intimated by the history and respect you have with and for each other. But, on another note, are you sure you're not IN love with her? You really praise her, you want her to think highly of you and you're even saying ""I still love her"". And you're relieved over your gf threatening to break up. I'm just asking, because at first glance it really sounds like something to think about. "
5,b43t53,t2_dii8k,ElectricFleshlight,"NTA, helping your ex wife is helping your children. Your partner is likely insecure because as the saying goes, ""if they'll cheat with you they'll cheat on you."" However, if she feels like she can't trust you, she should break up with you rather than scream at you. Side note, staying with the person you had an affair with is incredibly disrespectful to your ex wife. You acknowledge that you fucked up and she didn't deserve it, so why you stayed with your affair partner is beyond me. "
5,b43t53,t2_168sifcf,Aloafofbread1,"NTA, seems like you just have a healthy and mature relationship with your ex wife. I mean I would want the mother of my children to be able to have the funds to give them a good life too. I think your gf just kinda overreacted."
5,b43t53,t2_138ow2,03slampig,"YTA > I still love her. This is what makes you the asshole. If you wherent an asshole you would either have moved on by now and not love her or you wouldnt be in a relationship now if you still did. The fact you are stringing TWO women along is pretty shitty. If this was about providing for your kids you should have setup a trust, not try and hand their mother a ""significant"" amount no legal strings attached. "
5,b43t53,t2_1724zn,Luna_Sea_,"NTA! You are doing a wonderful thing imo. If you are relieved over the threats then go ahead & break up with her. She also disrespected your wife by participating in an affair with a married man, so she can get over her false sense of self righteousness. If I were in her situation I would think you were a good man for doing that & I would be so happy. How can someone be miserable about you sharing your lottery money? You do not have any obligation to anyone but your children. I also want to advise you to be careful with your money. When people win the lottery every person you’ve ever met comes out of the woodwork asking for handouts. Keep it private if you can. If you want to share, then talk to your lawyer about a good amount. I have read before that the best thing to do is give people that you want to help out a 1 time lump sum & let them know that will be it, not to ask for more. I can imagine how overwhelming it must be to suddenly have life-changing money. Make a good plan so it lasts. Put some money in an account for your children’s college. Congratulations! Enjoy the money! "
5,b43t53,t2_3aqyoopt,Amraff,"NTA Its your money, not hers. Your trying to do the reasonable thing and help out your children and if she cant see that, msybe she should leave. Your not giving the money to ex for HER to blow on things for herself, your giving it to her to improve the quality of life for your kids. Side note: not sure what property rights are like there but if gf sounds serious about leaving, talk to your lawyer so she doesnt try & take half. "
5,b43t53,t2_cg7e5,CheruthCutestory,"Definitely NTA. But you are in denial about not being in love with your ex, buddy. You could have easily framed this as being an additional child support for the kids. But you frame it as being about your ex-wife. You consider your current relationship the bad result of a ""fuck up"" due to being in a bad place. This is how you talk about the start of your current relationship. Wake up! This isn't how you talk about a relationship if you think it was ultimately a good thing. You wish you hadn't fucked up and were still with your wife. "
5,b43t53,t2_n7g2kqk,RobertAndRobbie,NtA. You are making you kids lives better you are making an innocent womans life better. Good for you. For the GF: She threatened to leave a millionaire because he is generous... ok. Bye
5,b43t53,t2_7auk0,Yablonsky,"NTA - How long have you been with your GF? If not long, then move on. What you did was truly for your kids and since you're not married, your GF has no input what you do with your winnings. If you've been together a long while and do intend on marrying, then she should understand it's for your kids and respect your decisions. What you did in NO WAY disrespects your GF. &#x200B;"
5,b43t53,t2_1kotx1s3,RisingBasilisk,NTA. You're a really nice dad and it sounds like to me your current girlfriend isn't mature enough to understand the underlying meaning of why you're wanting to give the money you want to give to your ex-wife. 
5,b43t53,t2_25quljxv,BadgerHooker,"NTA -You sound like a decent human being who has made mistakes and wants to make peace with your ex and maybe reparations. You are trying to do right for your kids and ex who you still coparent with, and if that makes your GF mad, that is on her. I wish you happiness and I hope that you can continue to be a good dad and co-parent. Your GF though, seems like she needs some therapy, STAT. Boundaries are tough, but it sounds like you really have a good sense of what should be prioritized. You got this!"
5,b43t53,t2_2hdwzvfj,venusianmoon,NTA. I don’t love my ex anymore but he’s a great coparent. Anything I can do to make his life better only enhances my child’s life which makes mine better. I know he’d do the same for me. I think it’s hard to understand that if you don’t have kids and if you have a challenging relationship with your coparent. I understand why it would be upsetting to your partner but it seems like she’s feeling a little insecure. Maybe find a way to show you appreciate her and she’s important to you too. 
5,b43t53,t2_31axebdl,Elegant-Rectum,"NTA - Explain to the girlfriend that you're doing it for your kids. You will live nicely with the money and your kids deserve to live nicely as well. If she doesn't give a shit and wants your kids to live like kings at your house and then be poor at their mom's house, she isn't the kind of stepmother you should want for your kids anyway. "
5,b43t53,t2_339me7oa,kittybikes47,"NTA times a million! And another clever acronym, courtesy if Dan Savage of Savage Love- DTMFA! Dump The Mother Fucker Already. She sounds awful! Hoiw could she possibly begrudge your children a comfortable upbringing, or be jealous of your ex-wife like that? "
5,b43t53,t2_dc7eh,vactu,"NTA. However, I do understand why your gf is upset, but breaking up threats are never a good idea. But yeah, she's the mother of your kids and you guys are okay enough to be adults about everything. Completely would do the same as you. "
5,b43t53,t2_176wkcgh,parrers,"NTA. In fact, apart from the affair you sound like the opposite of an asshole. Girlfriend is, at the end of the day, just a girlfriend. She gets no say in how you spend your money cause it is YOUR money. Congratulations by the way. You might want to think about a little college/house fund for the kids too."
5,b43t53,t2_rlf4732,TheJoJoBeanery,"NTA. You were the asshole years ago when you cheated, but this is a very respectable and honest gesture from the heart. I imagine your ""love"" of your ex is very hard to understand for your gf, so good luck with her, but don't let that change you, your intentions are good... (and I assume you're keeping a pretty chunk of change for yourself so enjoy and maybe treat the new lady to something really nice too, if she sticks around) "
5,b43t53,t2_11mvic7x,tancarpet1,"NTA. Nor is your ex. Based on first reactions the gf is. But if she comes around and is respectful then maybe nah. Your kids are your first responsibility, and your ex did nothing wrong, so giving her money is a gracious thing to do. The gf needs to see that."
5,b43t53,t2_u5bsg,thatonebuffbitch,"NTA, Me and my husband often discuss what we’d do with “fuck you” lottery winnings (if we ever start playing). His ex wife (and mother of two of his kids) is the first on our list to give money to. She’s not even as great as your ex wife sounds. She’s not always good to co parent with, sucks at communicating without fighting, is wishy washy in her relationship with us, and keeps the kids from us in some kind of weird show of power. She’s alright sometimes. But she’s still the mother of those kids so if we’re rich, she’ll be rich with us. Your girlfriend is childish. I have to wonder how her relationship with your kids is. "
5,b43t53,t2_8a0t3,MRiley84,"NTA, but from your girlfriend's point of view you are putting your ex-wife before her. I imagine your girlfriend will always have had your ex-wife in the back of her mind as a potential threat to her relationship. This could just be your girlfriend reacting to the perceived new threat - that this is going to bring you both back together."
5,b43t53,t2_ka3mp,evanjw90,"NTA. Your money, not your girlfriend's. Remember that. I still buy my ex wife a present every birthday, mother's day, and Christmas. It shows my son that just because we aren't together it doesn't mean there can't be love. Good job."

Yeah, YTA. >My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. Of course you are, you don't love your GF, you love your ex wife. I know this, your GF knows this, and yet somehow you want to pretend that you ""love, but not in-love.' Cut that middle-school bullshit (yeah I like her, but I don't *like*-like her). The first thing you wanted to do was share your winnings with the people most important to you: your parents and your ex. Now you're using this money to plan on how to get your wife back, and you realize that your current GF isn't that great anyway."
5,b43t53,t2_wfod1,floating_bells_down,"NTA The girlfriend is the asshole. Also, DingDingDing. You know your true feelings: >tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. It's like flipping a coin. The emotional peak of disappointment or happiness when you see heads or tails. It shows you what you really want. Edit: I'd do the same for the parent of my children.

5,b43t53,t2_2j1g9sp1,pokinthecrazy,NTA &#x200B; Sounds like you had a fuck up but then made it your girlfriend.

5,b43t53,t2_5j6li,erikpurne,"NTA. Ignore the whimpering golddigger girlfriend (sorry mods, best I could do given the circumstances.) She has zero claim to that money, and zero say in how it's used. The fact that she seems to disagree with this is, in my mind, a huge red flag. What you are planning is kind and generous and (IMO) right. You seem like a decent guy. Don't let her drag you down with her. "
5,b43t53,t2_bisra83,Asaxii,"You’re NTA OP, it seems like you have had plenty of time to gain a perspective on what you did in the past, and to take complete responsibility and accountability for your actions. Your ex-wife no doubt sees it this way and this is great for your children. Your current partner is most likely frightened that you are going to go back to your ex wife and abandon her, that or she may just be a selfish person who wants you to spend on the two of you instead. If she can’t understand the relationship you have with your children and the life you want to provide for them, and is threatening to leave you over it, then it says more about her than you. You are a better man than you were Op, you will figure out what is best for yourself I’m sure. Also I think you are right to do whatever you want with your money. Good luck to you! "
5,b43t53,t2_6h939,shellwe,"NTA This is the same woman who knew you were married but has sex with you anyway? What the hell are you doing, OP?! Seriously! Have you thought how this will turn out? If you marry this woman it sounds like she hasn’t changed why would she not do the same to you? I can’t speak for your ability to stay faithful but it sounds like you have a good heart despite some stupid selfish decisions. You need to leave her ASAP. The fact she is furious with you shows what a spiteful petty person she is. Listen to your parents on this one. She is obviously bluffing to volunteer to jump off the money train now but you need to kick her off. Hopefully there is no common law bullshit saying that entitles her to half of the money."
5,b43t53,t2_17jqbj,pineapplepucker,NTA! I think that’s awesome of you to help her out which definitely benefits your kids too! Awesome co-parenting and really nice of you to consider her having hobbies and a better life and how that benefits your family. Your girlfriend needs to get over herself.
5,b43t53,t2_irh3f72,AimMick,"NTA. As a matter of fact, you sound like a very stand up guy. Minus the affair- that sucks but you know that. I think it is amazing you want to give her a portion! If your current girlfriend can’t handle that- that is her issue. Not yours. Just protect yourself with the money in regard to your girlfriend if she does leave. "
5,b43t53,t2_vru81t2,BanaenaeBread,"NTA for wanting to give her money. Its great that you would do that for her and for your kid. And honestly, its somewhat fair. She and you both had to take a huge setback financially in life when you were divorced (I assume, as most people do). YTA IF you told her before your girlfriend. It sounds like you did, but maybe you just didn't mention it. Giving her the money isn't what is upsetting your girlfriend, its being the idea that you might be in love with your ex. One thing I would say is keep in mind that most people who win the lottery go bankrupt at some point. Be careful of how much money you give away to all your friends and family. Certainly if you have multiple millions be its good to be generous, but just be aware that it can go very quickly as people will keep asking you for more and more."
5,b43t53,t2_1oxrjm7k,uhqt,"NTA. It’s ironic how you cheat with her, but would get mad if you cheated on her. (Gf by the way, not ex-wife.) I always wonder why these women who help cheat always think they same thing couldn’t happen to them. Not saying you’re planning/are cheating on her, but still. She sounds insecure."
5,b43t53,t2_2hfch8qd,pungentredtide,"NTA. Quit fooling yourself though. You’re still in love with her. She’s just not available because of your fuck up. It’s the cheater’s mentality, you’ll always still want her and she’ll never be replaced in your heart (which is the worst part of cheating on someone who has given you children and treated you well). Your girlfriend likely won’t leave you (while you have money) because she’s dealt with knowing you’re still in love, but now she gets to do it on vacation. Not her fault you chose not to be faithful. You’ve been with her the six years since the divorce and still not made her your wife. It’s a good move because now you can get rid of her without paying half. I know you won’t marry her because she is just a reminder of what you completely fucked up. Your ex won’t come back, which you already know. Congrats on the money. Buy yourself a unicorn float. Also, I’d go to a doctor and get a thorough health screening. My paypal is d..... lol "
5,b43t53,t2_8l3ka2k,PotassiumPomegranate,"Honestly it sounds like you and your ex have a wonderful relationship. It is still perfectly fine to care for your ex. If you can help set her and your kids up for a good life, I find that more than fair. Currently your GF is just that, a GF. I honestly feel no legal or moral obligation to help her like your ex. So with this decision NTA. "
5,b43t53,t2_a3mrj,xubax,"NTA: girlfriend needs to understand that it's your money, the two of you aren't married. You can also say that if you ever get married and split up you'd treat her with the same respect. Or you can just kick her to the curb while you evaluate your future. "
5,b43t53,t2_phrnoyy,Lazydadster,NTA. People tend to think you can only love one person for some reason. I still love one of my ex’s despite how things turned out and I would do a lot for her. I wouldn’t get back with her but I mean if you truly love someone and you love their core person I don’t think you ever truly stop. You just let your hurt heal and learn from the past and move forward. Your gf seems to be lacking life experience and I would tread very carefully with your money.
5,b43t53,t2_yk06i,Robsterclaws,NTA - sounds like you messed up by cheating on her but if your new girl has a problem with you helping out the person who created life with you then she doesn't sound like much of a keeper anyway. Hook your ex wife up. Big time. Oh and congrats on the big win! I hope it brings happiness to you and your family!! 
5,b43t53,t2_2thxbm61,Ashlipig22,"NTA what you’re doing is is super kind of you. And your ex sounds very sweet and it’s really nice of you to want to help her. Your girlfriend on the other hand sounds kinda mean. Edit: after seeing some other comments, something I didn’t really think of is, as others have said, your girlfriend may just be intimidated by the friendly nature between you and your ex wife, which I can understand, it’s not every day you see two ex’s able to get along."
5,b43t53,t2_t8tai,Impulsive94,"NTA - you're providing for the mother of your children and by extension your children, how is that a bad thing? I can understand your GF is probably a bit touchy at the idea you're giving your ex money whereas she probably wouldn't get any cash from you, but would still benefit from your new lifestyle. Props to you for not taking your GFs threats seriously & doing what you think is right. It's kinda noble except for the reason you 2 broke up, though it shows remorse & growth in yourself as a person. Congrats on the big win OP! Check out r/personalfinance - those guys have some great advice for this exact situation."
5,b43t53,t2_r91kw5d,rotti5115,"Not a popular one but... YTA...First you cheat on your wife and now want to ""buy"" yourself a Clean conscience? leave your ex wife alone and spend the Money for your kids Also you dont seem to have any balls, why are you relieved by the anger of your CURRENT gf? Its like you expected her reaction. So dont and ask AITA. You knew and looked for an excuse. Afraid of breaking up, so cheat on her aswell so she has to do it, or give her a reason? Are you at a lowpoint again and reach for the next branch to hold you, in the expense of others? You Sound selfish and immature."
5,b43t53,t2_8utcdhh,il_the_dinosaur,"YTA for cheating on your wife, but I'm glad that when you got the chance you try to make up for it. Not many people would of that. It's funny your current gf is the one you cheated with so I assume she knows all about this and in a way should understand why you do what you do."
5,b43t53,t2_31w5slw8,christina0001,"NTA ... I don't think your GF is an asshole either, just human and insecure like many people are. I think what you did was awesome. I also think that this is a good learning experience for you. If your GF can't handle your being generous to your children and their mother when you can easily afford to be, without it costing her or your relationship with her anything, then I don't know that she's emotionally ready to be a stepparent. Not that you said you were looking to take the relationship there but this is a big red flag. This is coming from a stepmom btw. My step kids are grown but if they were living with their mom I would have no problem with my husband doing what you did."
5,b43t53,t2_2tbefgfv,corrin131313,"NTA- you are doing the right thing for your ex. The fact that you feel relieved at the thought of your gf leaving you is proof that you are not happy and might be ready to be done with the relationship. After all the things you have said about your ex in this post, it seems to me that you may still have feelings for her. It might be a good time to be done with your gf if things aren't working out. Then you can regroup and see if you can salvage your relationship with your ex. It might take counseling and a lot of proving to her that she can trust you. But this money might be be a blessing for you and your ex and your kids to repair your family. You can have your family together and make things better for you all. Even if you don't want to be with your ex, you should be with someone who will understand that being good to your ex is being good to your kids. You are allowed to do whatever you want with your money and you should be with someone who wants the best for your kids the same as you do. Good luck to you with whatever path you choose. But please don't ever let anyone you are with try to have you punish your kids in order to punish your ex in some way. As you said, she is good to the bone, she was good to you, she is good to your kids, she deserves some of this good fortune you have gotten. If it happens to bring the two of you back together, it just might be where you are supposed to end up. God bless you and your family, ex included. 😉 "
5,b43t53,t2_2smbojfe,CriticalEscapeBike,"To the OP, I would just like to say, even though we have never had any kids (in fact, that would make the record books if it happened)....I just wanted to say.....you were always my favorite. (And no....NTA). *Oh....and one more thing....if you make it worth my while, I'll take the GF off your hands.*"
5,b43t53,t2_4s78jha,roasted_sweet_potato,"I feel like you're a little bit of a dick to stay with your gf for 6 years even though it was a mistake for you and when you don't feel that strongly for her. It's kind of disappointing to find out the partner you've spent six years of your life with is still basically ""mentally married"" to his former wife. But I don't think you're an ass for giving your ex wife the money, especially when she's taking care of the kids. You did a good thing, and you did the right thing, even though it puts you between a rock and a hard place. NTA."
5,b43t53,t2_13j73z,Carliebeans,"NTA. I think it’s great that you want to share with your ex wife - she will be part of your life forever, and like you say, this will make her life easier and in turn, will make your kid’s lives easier too. "
5,b43t53,t2_gfd2eyo,JadeMarie80,"NTA You sound like a mature, responsible and caring father. Kudos to both you and your ex-wife for treating each other with respect and dignity and realizing that its about your kids and not about your egos. I love the fact that you've thought of them (ex and kids) when so many would not have. I've never understood how one ex can live in splendor while their kids live with the other parent in squalor. It boggles my mind. &#x200B; As far as your GF saying that you're disrespecting her--its really not about her. Again, its about your kids and providing a good life for them. She needs to understand that. The fact that you feel relief at her threats to leave should tell you something, too. Maybe this isn't the right relationship for you."
5,b43t53,t2_2za0pf62,lestatisalive,Nta: I think it’s very generous of you to consider her and it sounds as if she’s never asked you for any of the money or acted crazy about it. And you’re right in your thinking - you both co-parent and care for your kids. 
5,b43t53,t2_k77x3,GorillaGrey,"WOAH! So NTA! That is a huge deal. I know tons of people who wouldn't want their child-bearing partners to have any of their good fortune despite having children together. The fact that you want to make not only your children's lives, but their mother's life better is probably the most saintly thing you could do. You're gf is definitely not so great in this light though. "
5,b43t53,t2_xlw8506,silverbullet53,"NTA he just wants his kids to have just as good of a life as he has that the money will bring. Also, it’s kinda giving the ex wife something back for being good to him all this time. "
5,b43t53,t2_2r7ikx0c,hotpanoliveoil1,"NAH. Of course, it's incredibly generous and thoughtful of you to give the money to your ex wife. It shows that you are still looking out for her and the kids. But I can still understand why your current gf is insecure or angry. She's likely getting the wrong message after you gave away the money to the wife. It's possible that she feels betrayed. &#x200B; I have a few questions: First off, how much of the money did you give to the wife? You don't have to give me exact numbers if you don't want to, a percentage is fine. Also, how angry was your gf and what did she specifically say was making her angry? She could be insecure about you giving away money to your ex wife, or she could be a gold digger. It's a possibility. "
5,b43t53,t2_2n2202y6,Blueroyorbison,"NTA. And I would put money on the fact your GF knows that your ex is wonderful and deserving and remains supremely jealous of her. You left your wife for your GF, why wouldn't you leave your GF for someone else.. type feeling. Your GF sounds like the problem. But you didn't write enough about her to touch on that. But if she doesn't believe good people deserve good things, she kind of sucks. You though, you're a good dude. And kudos to your way of thinking and your consideration of your ex wife and your appreciation of your ex wife. It goes beyond the kids and that's a healthy divorce, healthy situation for those kids. Sorry your GF is behaving like basket case. She's the asshole. "
5,b43t53,t2_rwr7epj,allbeefqueef,"You are so NTA. When my dad cheated on my mom and they broke up, the woman he cheated with was a bitch. She wouldn’t let him give me anything if there was some way it could benefit my mother. Any nice gifts had to stay at her house and she made sure I knew that me and my mom were trash. She hated that he had to pay child support. Giving your ex that money is taking care of your kids. You’re a good guy. "
5,b43t53,t2_2pzfy01d,Rachel_Nichols_ESPN,"NTA. I can understand why you're ""girlfriend"" would be upset. but the fact of the matter is she is your girlfriend, she really has no place to tell you what to do with the money. Another important thing is that she is the one you cheated on your wife with. To me this has more to do with her entitlement to ""your"" money than her jealousy. Point is, your better off without her, let her leave you."
5,b43t53,t2_1x2st2w,mutherofdoggos,"NTA. &#x200B; Your GF knowingly slept with a married man, so clearly her moral compass isn't calibrated correctly. Ignore her, this isn't her money and you guys aren't married so she doesn't get an opinion. I find it extremely amusing how threatened she is by your ex-wife. Then again, she knows she is with a man who cheats, so her insecurity is understandable in a way. &#x200B; You did a shitty thing when you cheated on your wife (and then stayed with the woman you cheated with...) but I commend you for doing the right thing and sharing this money with your ex and your kids. &#x200B;"
5,b43t53,t2_1jxorewq,Animalprincess1982,NTA in fact very noble of you. I say break up w GF and get back together with your wife Just make sure you aren’t giving her money as I “please forgive me” and do it because you really do love and care for her
5,b43t53,t2_1910ixka,HushabyeNow,"NTA - It’s so great to see people who can co-parent successfully. Anyone who says you’re the A is out of their minds. GF lost the right to complain regarding your previous relationship when she disrespected it. You made some mistakes, but are obviously trying to do the right thing here. Love you for it. See a lawyer, asap, and stick to your guns."
5,b43t53,t2_4y3s4,RobNoxious,"NTA. Money to the Ex directly benefits your kids, both in the obvious; she has money to take care of them, and the less obvious, she has less stress while doing so. Also, and perhaps more importantly, it strengthens and improves your relationship with each other, which, like it or not, **A** relationship between you exists, as long as she is in your life as your Baby Momma. "
5,b43t53,t2_b4dz3,armh1313,"NTA, your motives are good and this is probably bringing up a lot of the guilt she may feel for breaking a marriage apart. You want to alleviate stress in her life and give your kids a better life. I can see how your GF would be threatened by this, but also if she were secure in the relationship, I don't see her reacting the way she did. She's as aware as you are that you both hurt your ex wife and she probably doesn't like that you feel the need to make amends. Though at the end of the day, it sounds like you'll still have plenty of money for you and your GF and that would be enough for me."
5,b43t53,t2_9tpg1m7,GirlisNo1,"NTA. I get that you’re in a serious relationship, but you and your gf aren’t married and that makes it your money. If you want to give whatever amount to the mother of your children, you should absolutely be able to do that. Your ex was/is a big part of your life, you share children with her and I think you’re a great person for wanting to do this. "
5,b43t53,t2_cqgiy,TriGurl,"NTA. That is very generous of you and the fact that you still love her and respect her and will allow her to be in a better place financially as she’s raising your kids is very generous. Your gf on the other hand is the total asshole here. It’s not her money, not her say. Period. From what I read above I think you said you told your gf, you didn’t ask you gf. You’re an adult. You can make your own mind up and it’s not her choice. Her response though is really speaking loudly of her character. I might take her up on the offer to break up and then sit back and watch her try to beg you to take her back. A good person would be incredibly happy for you for experiencing something like that and then would support your decision. They would even have the freedom to offer their opinion but in a respectable way. And then respect your decision. "
5,b43t53,t2_2xadprwi,thedarkcrystalkira,"NTA The fact that you can admit to fucking up like that and still have stable relationship with your kids and ex, you should b somewhat proud. I think it’s the right thing to share the money with the mother of your children, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Also you should have a long sit down conversation with your gf that of course ur kids and their mother are going to get some money, and while you really respect your ex for putting up with you, you are not ‘in love’ with her and you will still have part of the winnings. If you are feeling ‘done’ in the relationship and her reaction made you see this then I think still have the conversation but just add on to it that you can’t be with someone who is that disrespectful to your ex, the mother of your children, because your kids will see this and that’s not someone you want in your, or their, lives."
5,b43t53,t2_2zpxw6h4,crquiggles, NTA That's super awesome of you to do for your ex and the kiddos. If she's bitter well all well it isn't her money....
5,b43t53,t2_1qm5qvpc,BarryBwana,NTA .... obviously.... I mean can anyone describe a scenario where you become an asshole by supporting a fantastic mother to your children who is also just a good person? Might want to consider re-evaluating how you and your gf's values line up....
5,b43t53,t2_2ukgy5ic,alwayzhungry1,"NTA you are putting your kids first. Props to you. Girlfriend needs to cool her jets. Seems insecure to me but idk her so, whateva Congrats on the money. But you know how it goes. Mo money mo problems"
5,b43t53,t2_7tfy2c,CoastalCerulean,"NTA and congrats! My ex-husband and I still love one another, and we're close. I've re-married, and vouched for him with his new g/f... We have 3 kids together, and they're parented by all of us in a happy, loving environment. We're all on TeamKid, and it's really paid off over time. You did a really good thing, it's an investment in your future and your family. Edited to remove opinions about the girlfriend."
5,b43t53,t2_34reqzio,DemonKatt,"NTA. I think it's a good thing that you care to give your ex the money because if she's good then the kids are good too. It'll make her life and your kids life easier and that's all that matters. Being someone with a dead beat dad and a mother who worked her ass off to take care of two kids by herself, I always feel good seeing dads that care and don't want to see their ex struggle for their kids. I don't really think its your girlfriends business in how you show that you care or who you show that care to. If she can't get with the program cutting her loose, might be the best option."
5,b43t53,t2_2a7r8r2y,curtmil,"I think it is wonderful that you are trying to do right by your ex-wife. This really isn't your girlfriend's business. It is your money to do with as you please. Your ex is the mother of your children, you loved her once, and still care for her based on your past relationship and her current status as your children's mom. Good for you. Why people think you cannot still have strong feelings for an ex, I do not know. Especially one to whom you were married and with whom you have children. I think your girlfriend's reaction says a heck of a lot about her. It probably says something about you too, as well as the state of your relationship. She probably is afraid you want to get back with your ex-wife. Perhaps that is a reasonable fear. You are NTA in this particular instance. The cheating, well, you didn't ask about that."
5,b43t53,t2_1v7an5lp,Only_on_the_Surface,"NTA - it's your money to do what you want with. I a small way I understand the jealousy and insecurity that this shows you're still in love with your ex. With that said, she should understand you did it for your kids too. Lastly, if you're feel g relieved by her threats if ending the relationship, then you should probably end it yourself. If the thought of her leaving doesn't make you sad or hurt then it's probably not meant to be. "
5,b43t53,t2_12emcf,KVirello,"NTA. You seem like a really great guy. It's your money to do with as you please. If your girlfriend can't accept you giving it to your wife, maybe she can accept you providing for your children while they are in the care if their mother (wink wink). "
5,b43t53,t2_is6154g,persePHOreth,"NTA at all. Not even a little. You're thinking of your kids, you're being respectful and thoughtful to a person you care about that's in your life. Your girlfriend, however... she's the asshole. Sounds like you can do better. Everyone makes mistakes. It doesn't mean you have to be lashed to your mistake. You can learn, grow, and move on."
5,b43t53,t2_gykl8,Allecia,"NTA. You have ""fuck you"" money. Whatever amount of money you gave your ex sounds negligible (enough) compared to what you got. So who cares that you gave her money when it doesn't affect your quality of life?! And, AND your current beau is your GF. *Girlfriend*. She is not your wife, or the mother of your children, or a fiance. She has no say over your finances. It is your money and you get to say what you do with it. The fact she is this upset over it seems WAY over the top! Especially since you appear to have so much money that it is not relevant to how you will (would have?) continue to live your life with her. I am baffled that she even cares. I think it is just lovely what you did (are going to do). Speaking of which, what a kind and amazing gesture you did (or are going to do). I'm super impressed that you learned from your mistake (don't forget those life lessons, even though you have gobs of money! Don't turn into one of those crappy entitled millionaire assholes!) and are doing better. Good on you! I'm massively impressed. :) Take your cash and live a good life for you and your kids. :) Second, huge gratz!! That's so great!! Woo hoo! Good luck. Sorry your GF got all weird and insecure. But not your issue to solve (but you can help if you want), and you are NTA."
5,b43t53,t2_2rdbp4wg,yourboyfriendistrash,"NTA for giving some of the money, but I hope you don't use this same language in front of your girlfriend, because it 100% sounds like you regret your relationship with her (you straight up called it a mistake) and wish you could be with your ex wife again (expressing regret for losing her, wanting to prove yourself to her as if winning her back). Sounds like you've felt that way from the start. I fully understand why she thinks you're still **in love** with her. You make it sound like you are. No comment on your girlfriend's character. Judging by the sticky, there isnt any more of that needed. *You* need to either admit that you want your ex wife back, or stop making it sound explicitly like you do."
5,b43t53,t2_8s5keco,lucidanecdote,"NTA - I love my wife very much and I know if we got a divorce for whatever reason that I would try my best to help her out. Shit, if I won a million dollars I'd give her half. She is a great mother and wants what is best for the kids. If I were you, I'd make your baby mammas (Ex's) life as easy as possible. You did the right thing. Get a new girlfriend if she can't understand such a simple thing as helping out someone that is going to be taking care of your kids and that you USED to love. Also...loan me five dollars. Thanks."
5,b43t53,t2_6r130ag,fwooby_pwow,"Yikes. This is tough. YTA - for cheating on your wife but still treating her like you're in love with her while in a relationship with someone else. Your girlfriend thinks you're going to cheat on her with your ex-wife and I absolutely can't blame her for thinking that. You already cheated before. And regardless on if she ""deserves"" it or not, she's still freaking out. You are not a trustworthy person. If you and your ex had broken up amicably and you met your girlfriend later on, I would say NTA and she was overreacting. But yeah. I can see why she's freaking out. I'm not saying she's right, but pretty much every single thing you do in regards to your ex will be scrutinized to death because you are a cheater. Also: >She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. Isn't it fucked up that your wife is respectful to you but disrespectful towards your girlfriend? You're the one who was in a relationship and cheated. Yes, your girlfriend was there too, but if it wasn't her, you would've fucked some other girl behind your wife's back. Don't you think your girlfriend is a teensy bit bothered that your wife is nice to you but ignores her existence? All of these details make me think you'll eventually cheat on your girlfriend with your ex, and she thinks that too. You need to change pretty much everything about yourself, dude. Just based on a Reddit post *you wrote*, I don't trust you."
5,b43t53,t2_123zkb,X23onastarship,"NTA Your kids should always be number one and doing this for their mum is great for them and shows them a great example of coparenting. Your girlfriend shouldn’t talk to anyone about disrespect, though it sounds like your relationship might already be unhappy, based on you being relieved, so maybe it’s time to talk about that with her? Not even saying breakup, but maybe talk to her when she calms down. "
5,b43t53,t2_e1oyy,Floppycakes,"NTA - ""Fuck you"" amounts of money bring out the true character of a person, and it sounds like you'd be better off if your girlfriend actually left you over this. She's TA. Have fun with that. Congrats on the money, it's a great filter for figuring out who your friends are. You are absolutely right to give your ex some money. It sounds like she is perfectly capable of being responsible with it, and as you said, it will give your kids an even better life overall."
5,b43t53,t2_53rtx,ShepardG,"YTA, You acknowledged your actions (having an affair) were a fuck up. Yet 6 years later your still with the the GF you cheated on your wife with? AND at no point in this 4 paragraphs have you EVER acknowledged your feelings about this GF that you've been with for 6 years. (or should we start to refer to her as a bang maid, cause that's the impression that It feels like you think of her) You are a Grade A Asshole dude. The term ""Shit or get off the pot"" ever get told to you throughout your life? You led your GF along for 6 years!, wtf is wrong with you??? And now you have this ginormus sum of money, and you want an excuse to leave this GF in the dust????? Stop being a giant douche, and start acting like a grown ass man. You fucked up your first relationship, to get your dick wet, then instead of taking some time BY YOURSELF, you moved in/used your ""Girl Friend"" to support yourself for the last 6 years, and now your rich, you see some magic way to solve your previous mistake, and you realize that you no longer need your ""Girl Friend"" to survive, and you might be able to get your wife back. Fuck you man, not only are you the Asshole, Your a piece of shit also."
5,aqy4bn,t2_8viymuh,huntingbears93,NTA. My Dad assumed girls physicals were like boys (obvi theirs is more invasive) and he ran like hell. He wanted no part of me getting undressed or being apart of the exam. I feel that should be normal. Your step dad either is crossing a line he doesn’t realize or is a total creep. 
5,aqy4bn,t2_1j88je6y,Granola007,"NTA. But I'm going to give your SD the benefit of the doubt. I don't think he's creepy, I think parents sometimes just pick and choose the wrong battles. I know I want my kids to do what I say, because I'm logical and I'm right and they just don't get it. Your SD is logical and right - he's already seen you in your unders and doesn't see the big deal.

When take my boys, since they were 13 and 15, not only do I leave the room while they change, but also when they are asked certain questions. My oldest (now 17) always laughs when I run out of the room when they get to the questions regarding being sexually active. But it's his business. Insist on your privacy! "

She's not an asshole for not wanting more kids, you wouldn't be the asshole to break it off because she didn't and you did. But you went and had to be an asshole about. You're trying to paint her as shitty person for not wanting more kids. If she doesn't want more kids she doesn't want more kids, it's her choice, she can't be wrong about it. She was probably so nonchalant about being done because you were being an asshole about it and\or she's a mature adult and realized that you shouldn't continue a relationship with someone who is clearly on a different page than you with regard to kids. ETA: And in the future, don't try to strong arm someone into having more kids than they actually want. That's how you end up with an ex wife who resents her children. "
5,b5jdwq,t2_jj6v8,zuzumotai,"YTA. Not for wanting to break up, because its totally valid to not want to be with someone if your goals for the future don't match. You want a big family. She's done and doesn't want any more kids. That's fair for both of you. BUT she TOLD YOU when you first got together that she wasn't interested in having any more kids. You went in with that information. Trying to hold the relationship over her head and get her to budge for YOUR benefit when you knew from the START that it was going to be like this is a dick move. You were shocked that she agreed to break up, possibly because you thought it might change her mind, right? Wrong. Sure, having a new kid would be easier with your support. But she doesn't want one. End of story. Stay broken up if you really want more kids. She's happy with the one and that's fine. "

She’s not an asshole for not wanting more kids just as much as you’re not an asshole for wanting them, clearly this means you guys just aren’t a match. If that’s a dealbreaker then you need to accept it and move on, it’s unfair to both of you for you to waste time entertaining the relationship assuming she’ll change her mind somewhere down the line. "
5,b5jdwq,t2_5w5wl,nkdeck07,"YTA and don't make stupid empty threats. This is the number one without question hill that she SHOULD die on. There's literally no more important hill that a relationship should ever die on. All people considering different positions on this hill should take their relationship up there and shoot it dead. &#x200B; You can't compromise on kids, you can't have half a kid. This is obviously important to her to not do again and it's important to you to have a family. You need to find someone that WANTS to have kids, not someone that would only begrudgingly have them because you ""convinced"" them. "
5,b5jdwq,t2_2fgb8q16,lxilahellsing,"YTA No one can guarantee that you will be an angel and will stay by her side. She had enough mistrust in her life, what makes you think that you are any different?

Break up with her because she deserves better."
5,b5jdwq,t2_dsflb,Delicious_Albino," YTA for how you went about it. You’re not an asshole for wanting to be with someone who wants kids. Thing is, she told you from the get go that she didn’t want any other kids. And you’ve strung her along this whole time knowing you had a problem. You can’t convince someone to want kids and it’s not right to try. It’s HER body and her choice. But, like I said, wanting to be with someone who also wants kids is totally valid. A lot of people wouldn’t feel fulfilled in life without kids. But you could’ve just been real with her from the start and for that you really messed up. Don’t try and get back with her though. You will not convince her to have kids and this will still be a giant issue. Just let the relationship be in the past and both of you can move on and find someone more compatible with your future goals. "

I don’t blame either of you - people want what they want - but she’s been very clear and upfront from the beginning. Maybe your timings off or maybe you’re not quite as on par as you think you are, but YTA for expecting her to shift all of her plans and desires for you without considering you’re not willing to do the same for her. "
5,b5jdwq,t2_175929,redditKMC,"YTA - she made her decision and does not want any more children. If you do, you should break up. Offering an ultimatum in this case is a really bad idea - she could agree to it, then when it becomes time to get pregnant, go back on her word. Your girlfriend is doing the right thing breaking up - she knows she doesn't want children, and you are being an ass thinking she is just being stubborn or that it will be easier this time. Some women go through hell when they are pregnant, and others just don't want to deal with another child. there is nothing wrong with this, and you downplaying this is very immature. "

I see why you got mad at her. You basically told her to take a sip of the bitter medicine she forced her daughter to take. &#x200B; One suggestion though: If her daughter confided in you, maybe you could reach out to her to offer support if she needs any. So she could call you if things take a turn for the worse. It's always important to know someone has your back. Especially if it's someone in your family treating you badly, possibly gaslighting you.

I hope your daughter goes no contact with you. She deserves better. 
5,ag9jwg,t2_ss5vm,sjallllday,"YTA. Absolutely. She’s 15. She needs privacy. You made the smart decision by taking her electronics away. But taking away her privacy is way overboard. She’s turning into a young woman, her body is likely changing and she doesn’t want people to see it while she gets dressed. She doesn’t want to be 100% visible to the entire house even when she’s just sitting on her bed reading her book. There are better ways to correct a childs’ behavior than take away their privacy. Get her into some therapy"

Your level of assertiveness is more appropriate to a pushy door to door sales person than a grandparent who left 30 minutes after the baby woke up. You're skipping way too many steps in an otherwise healthy relationship. They stayed 30 minutes after the baby woke up. Since the baby took a long nap, that was the miracle, right? staying a bit longer is normalish. Apply some other techniques before you escalate this far. "

What's more, is I ask my family to also exclude my children until they're old enough to decide for themselves if they want to practice their religion or not. When the kids ask me about my ideas, I tell them that I will not talk about it until they are older.
