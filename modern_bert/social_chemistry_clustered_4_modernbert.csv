4,a1311q,t2_2kabg9z7,xormun,"Uh absolutely NTA. These are really really horrid behaviors for your partner to display. 1. Says you take everything personally, but takes you saying you don't like your job as an attack on your entire lifestyle with him. 2. Holds things he willingly did with you over your head as if you owe him compensation for his own choices? 3. Brings up your weight as if it has any relationship to the topic at hand. You are an angel and you deserve all of the support in the word. If he withdraws support and affection because you say you aren't happy, that's a really unhealthy (and potentially abusive) relationship. He's asking you to be dependent on him and then shaming you for doing so. If you're unhappy with work (and a call center sounds like it would be, of course) you should try to find something closer to your interests. His job might be ""harder"" but if it's in a field he enjoys and wanted to pursue then it makes a huge difference. In the meantime, you deserve a partner that will listen. If he won't accept your feelings as valid and chooses to attack you for speaking your truth, I think you should consider having a very serious conversation with him. You deserve unconditional love, always."

My girlfriend has hypothyroidism and i know the struggle she goes through dealing with her metabolism, limiting her calories and still dealing with weight gain at times. It’s not your fault. If your boyfriend can’t understand that then I would question whether or not he’s mature enough to be in a committed relationship. I also known the pure and utter fucking misery of working in a call center. That’s a shitty job. I’m now fortunate enough to have my dream job (software engineer) and although it’s much harder overall, it never ever feels that way because I love doing it. Never underestimate the value that loving what you do brings to your ability to power through difficulty and obligation. I would say to OP: - Spend some time thinking about what it is that you could see yourself doing and being happy. We all have to work unfortunately, that’s just life. But that doesn’t mean that we have to hate our jobs. Figure out what that looks like for you and what a first step is towards that journey, and then take it. Don’t do it for your boyfriend, but for you. - if you aren’t already, I would highly encourage you to see a doctor for your thyroid condition. There is medication that Can help regulate your thyroid hormone levels and also control some of the more painful side effects. Prior to getting on her medication, my girlfriend dealt with hair loss, chronic fatigue, nausea, among others. - as for your boyfriend, his behavior sucks right now. He may feel some resentment because in his mind he is contributing more than you are, but to be honest, relationships go like that sometimes. The key thing is support. Do you feel supported by him to take positive steps in your life or do you feel like he criticizes you? The difference between those two will be very telling about the future of your relationship. Ideally, when things are unequal in terms of contributions, the partner that is contributing more is supportive because there is trust that the other person means well and is working towards something better or dealing with something temporary."

We planned all the meetings, did 90 percent of the research, put together the presentation and each presented our portions really well, but the rest of the presentation was a total mess. After the project was done, the professor asked to meet with me and the other two group leaders to ask what went on. We told her that we had done most of the work, and she gave us A’s while the rest of the group got C’s and D’s depending upon their presentation. Some of them BS’d it really well. The point is, if you’re doing the work and the professor is good at what they do, they’ll notice. I would have reached out to express your frustrations before leaving the rest of the group hanging. "

Catholic school is expensive! Your family is making a huge sacrifice. It's fine to be embarrassed about the smoking, but never, ever, ever be embarrassed about someone working to make money. Reselling merchandise for a profit isn't shady. Be proud of your family and who you are. The other girls at school are assholes, too, and are gonna judge you no matter what you do. "
4,aka65b,t2_13v81yzn,CariadChavez,"YTA - I'm so sorry, because I really feel you on this, but the reason you get to go to your fancy school is because your father is doing what he's doing. This is classic teenage girl stuff, especially first generation teenage girl stuff. These high school girls will evaporate in a few years, and they all hate each other anyway. Your father loves you and you've hurt him. Apologize, try to make it right and sleep safe in the knowledge that people who would judge your father for working hard to give you a better life are not people whose opinion matters much of anything."

He cares about his daughter and wants to provide her the best possible opportunities. He sounds like an old-school Vietnamese guy, my guess is either first or second generation American. Your parents sound like the perfect embodiment of the American dream, tbh - to work hard in order to provide a better life for your kids than you had and to pull yourself up by the bootstraps. In the end, the petty drama of being a teenager will mean nothing. Learn to appreciate what you have. They're mostly doing it for you. Who honestly cares what the spoiled daughters of wealthy people think of your family? You'll get a lot further in life by learning the hard-working and frugal values of your parents than by trying to emulate the vanity of your classmates. As far as smoking, your dad works hard, and if he wants to smoke, if that brings him a little sense of satisfaction, he should be entitled to do it. You'll get through it, and be better for it in the end. Teenagers are stupid, so try not to care what they think so much."

Now the Craigslist thing- I feel ya OP, I really do, but he’s not selling that stuff for fun- he’s making sure y’all’s bills are paid and there’s food on the table. His smoking is a health hazard and I mean you could talk to him about how it’ll affect him negatively but you shouldn’t focus too much on how your friends view it. Your friends don’t live with him, your friends aren’t paying his bills, and your friends ultimately don’t affect his life. I think you owe your dad an apology. Explain that you’ve been feeling a little overwhelmed at school and you’re finding it a little hard to fit in so you’ve been nit picky with certain things.

To insinuate her motives, saying it’s only for her, is extremely rude. I mean you have to know that it’s a heartbreaking thing for a mother to hear her child doesn’t care about Christmas anymore, but you stated it bluntly and then followed it up by saying she is tossing her childhood baggage on you. So now, not only does she think you don’t want to participate in Christmas but she feels like a burden on the rest of her family which is the exact opposite of what she wanted. Your still young, and seem pretty bright and have well drawn out conclusions you’ve thought about. But if you love your mother, sometimes it’s about enduring it for their sake. Not making them feel bad when really to you it isn’t hurting you in any way other than being slightly annoying. When your 28 and on your own you’ll regret the times you didn’t avoid hurting her when you could’ve just played along, especially if she is a good mom otherwise. If you are me anyway, you may be different but that’s my experience,"
4,a4hfkv,t2_bgum7ty,Belellen,"NTA But if I may inject: maybe she's focusing on using Christmas as a stand in for happiness/family time? Sure, she's put her foot in her mouth by forcing *her* ideas of happiness/family time on to you, just like her parents forced their ideas on to her, rather than learn what *you as an individual* and not her idealised idea of you might like and find some common ground. Maybe when this settles down a bit reinforce that while you hate Christmas you don't hate the idea of spending time with your mum and have some ideas of quality time you could spend with her/the family that you could stand doing. Yeah, I'm asking you to be the parent in this relationship and that's not fair on you but it honestly sounds like she is so caught up in protecting her ideas that she doesn't have emotional space to work it out for herself. It will be better for the relationship in the long run and if it doesn't work then you know you've tried."

I'd been with my ex for almost a decade at that point and my brother enjoyed having a ""bro"" to commiserate with since I'm his only sibling. I was fine with it, I just didn't want my brother giving my ex husband any information on my life after him. Which he was good with. &#x200B; It didn't last long for him, because my ex just continually bashed me and complained to my brother how I'd ruined his life. My brother at one point stopped him mid sentence as was like ""dude, you do realize that is my SISTER you're talking about, and if I hear one more nasty word about her come out of your mouth, I'm going to kick your ass"". He stopped talking to him after that. Didn't mention the encounter to me for a few years. I gave him the biggest hug for standing up for me. "

These are not major fight starters and definitely don’t need for her to leave or not speak to you for days. Plus you’ve apologized for the other things and the brownies were a simple mistake. She’s over reacting and especially about things that don’t even include her, like the marathon and your sprained foot. Plus if she smokes anyways, I don’t see why the brownies are a big deal. Side note: I thought the lyrics were cheesy but cute and I would’ve forgiven my bf, but that is just me. "

It doesn't seem like you yelled or anything, and if the employee got into trouble it's probably for not following policy. It seems like a no brainer to extend the parking "

The counter rep should absolutely not have had a bad attitude with you by being condescending, they could just say “I’m sorry, according to our policies I can’t do that, give me a moment to get the supervisor so we can take care of this situation for you.” Bam, manager (who knows about your arrangement) can take care of, the employee doesn’t get in trouble for being a snotty brat, and everyone wins.

I would absolutely be frustrated too if it had never been an issue for years and suddenly was, but you have to understand that they were doing you a favor and breaking policy for you in the past and now they are following policy. You can't expect every employee to know who you are and it's annoying af when people expect special treatment just because you've gotten it in the past. Also, the employee was right. It doesn't matter how much you spend at the hotel, parking is a separate fee. You can't go to the grocery store and say ""well I spent $25k here last year, so you have to give me that bottle of wine for free!"" It just doesn't work that way. Next time, you should *calmly and kindly* ask to speak to the manager and ask why it is an issue after it hasn't been for years, don't argue with an employee who didn't make the rules and has no idea why a random person would get free parking."

Oh man, is customer service the funnest job in the world. You all were literally trying to get him to bend the rules, so you all could park past the time allotted without paying. Honestly, if it were me, I'd either say no, just like how he did. Especially since he only got an attitude after you insisted and copped one first. OR.

HOAs can only enforce the rules that are written into their governing documents, they don't mediate disputes between neighbors. So the HOA might be able to address the dogs pooping on the HOA property, but not your private property. Are there rules about the number of dogs, if they must be leashed, how often an owner has to pick up dog poop in his own back yard in your governing documents? Does your HOA have the authority to fine written into its documents? Let's say best case scenario, the HOA has rules about all those things, and the governing documents allow them to fine or even require the dogs to be removed if they are deemed a nuisance. And the HOA sends all their letters and fines, and the dog owner ignores them. Deed restrictions are a civil contract - they are enforced in the courts. Do you have a Board of Directors willing to incur the cost of a lawsuit? I would call Animal Control rather than the HOA. Virtually every city has rules about dogs having to be leashed in public, disposal of waste, and keeping the dogs in sanitary condition. And the city will have much more power to enforce than an HOA will. "

What if they decide religion doesn’t have a place in their lives? Will that money just vanish since they aren’t being raised “properly?” All that is a hornet’s nest of fucked up legal stuff. I wouldn’t want to deal with that (on top of the other legal stuff it takes to adopt) either. If I were you I’d try to find a way to secure that money for the kids (it’s not only the right and ethical thing to do, but it sounds like you have everything else taken care of anyway). I would happily adopt the kids, and see about getting them grief counseling as well as family therapy for all of you. The idea being that you all seamlessly fit into each other’s lives and any bumps along the way becomes grounds for resentment. If the kids are hyper religious, respect that. Also inform them that you or your family won’t be preached to, talked down to, and you won’t tolerate any bigotry. Lay your ground rules, but allow them to express themselves in their religion. If they want to go to church every Sunday, take’em. If they want to sit at home, eat chocolate frosted sugar bombs, and watch cartoons, that’s fine too. Don’t tell them atheists are respectful and, generally good people. Show them. Prove it day in and day out.

With regard to Ada's estate, she could place the funds for the girls in a trust and name an attorney, bank manager, etc. to serve as a trustee (or co-trustees). A monthly stipend to cover living expenses for the kids could be determined with increases over the years as the girls' needs increase.

Your attitude towards religion seems like it might be a bit harsh, but as long as you wouldn't forbid her children from being religious you wouldn't be an AH, you don't have to indoctrinate them into a religion just because your sister wants you to, but you also shouldn't prohibit it if her kids want to be religious.

And that is probably equally important to your sister as is religion. Can you meet her halfway in something like maybe ensuring that while you won’t be able to raise them under the same religious expectations she would have had she been alive and parenting them, you can at least ensure they will learn about the religion and they can make their own decision.

If you tell them this isn't real or you don't believe in it, you could seriously traumatize them. You won't teach them religion which will give you the funds to care for them, and you won't ""waste"" your own money on them. What a crappy brother! I understand why your family made you the black sheep. There have been atheists who raised other people's children catholic/jewish/etc. because that is what the passing parents believed. Just because they believe doesn't mean you have to. Just put them in a once a week religion class, and you wouldn't really even have to discuss it much. Just don't tell children who think their mom is in heaven that there isn't one, you will destroy them! (somebody said this once to a kindergardener in my class who said her dad was in heaven. The girl was devastated for weeks thinking her father was just in a whole in the ground rotting. DO NOT DO THIS TO THE KIDS just because you hate religion. I can't believe you would allow relatives to end up in the foster system just because you think religion is foolishness and don't want the kids raised that way.

You should also emphasize that if they aren't feeling well or choose not to go, you will not make them go. Then I think you should have asked that she put all the money in a kids care account marked specifically for their education and household expenses, and could not be used for any other purpose.

4,b6i6nc,t2_an8ub,alexds1,"YTA, mostly for not doing your research and assuming what her reasoning might be. The transgirl/ transwoman experience IS a feminine experience. But it's also a specific one to transwomen. Adding the modifier doesn't make you less of anything, any more than me saying I'm an Asian woman does. It just means that this is a specific type of experience, since there is no universal way to be a woman. I should add that labels might not be important to you because you benefit from being in the majority group. But finding your place is very important to a lot of people, and so is finding your right label. If you want to support your trans friends in the future maybe listen to more conversations by trans folx online or via podcasts or in person, and not offer advice or suggestions about an experience you don't personally share."
4,b6i6nc,t2_mejbt8f,MajSloth,"NTA if her goal is to be female, and she has made progress towards it then at someppint she needs to drop the trans tag. Now thats not to say she shouldn't mention it at all! The transition will always be a part of her life and if brought up in conversation she should feel as if she is able tofreely talk about it. However to label herself as a 'trans girl' would suggest to me and anyone else talking to her that she still doubts it! She should talk about herself as what she percieves herself as or wants to be. I ask the open question: if you have put in all that work to get into an identity and body you truly feel comfortable with, wouldn't you want everyone to know you simply by the gender you've transitioned into?"
4,b6i6nc,t2_3bfxf0gf,1_Justbreakup,"YTA, clearly your friend has self image issues and also general insecurities that everyone has, and she has decided to make trans a part of her identity, maybe to try to own that insecurity, maybe for other reasons. In any case you are being severely inconsiderate because you don’t get to choose other people’s identities. Yes maybe it’s slightly annoying or it feels unnecessary to you, but it’s really not your place to say. Imo you were being rude to bring it up to her and ignorant to think that her label is the source of her problems, rather than the fact that she was born a different sex than the one she feels she is! The label is something that is important to her and you should apologize for pressuring her to drop it..."
4,b6i6nc,t2_9p08h,ennuithereyet,"While I can understand where you're coming from and I know you meant well with it, YTA. It's not your place to tell her what she should call herself. Telling her to stop calling herself trans probably sounded to her like you're trying to erase that part of her identity, even though it's probably really important for her because it has shaped many of her life experiences. That being said, you were trying to help. I would just apologize for not realizing how important the term would be to her, and I'm hoping you can move on from it and continue your friendship. "

Having their son’s wife (you know the person their son brought into the family to share holidays, traditions, memories) around might be comforting for them as I’m sure they haven’t moved on. My parents got divorced and my mom still stops by to visit my grandma from my dad’s side every once in a while. Just because the context of the relationship changed doesn’t mean how much you care about the person does. Her husband’s family isn’t connected to your family. Framing it like it’s only acceptable for her to interact with her old in-laws if she spends a proportionate amount with your family is a weird ultimatum to put on an already strained situation.

They were probably the only people that even came close to understanding what she was going through. They are also the last link she had to him. Loosing a partner is crushing. It’s a harrowing experience you never truely ‘get over.’ She will always love him, but that does not mean she can’t love you. You suck because you were unfair when you asked her to cut off all contact. That shows you don’t respect what she went through. She sucks too. She should respect your feelings and your partnership. It sounds like she’s not listening to your needs. It’s unfair of her to not balance her time better. She needs to asses if she really wants to be in this relationship and make some adjustments. If she wants to be with you she needs to compromise, she needs to make you feel loved and important. She needs to make time to spend with your family because it’s important to you. You both suck. You both need to be more empathetic and respectful of each other’s needs. "
4,b41w0n,t2_bzv0pfh,LazyCrazySloth,"Nta. He died 2.5 years ago. That's a pretty long grieving period. I understand her maintaining a close bond with them, but for her to not see her own (though you can't assume she has a good relationship with them anyways) and to ignore yours is just plain rude. If she wasn't ready to let him and his family go, she shouldn't have jumped back into dating. I'm not saying shes not allowed to still grieve, but she is not being fair in the relationship due to her own personal hangups. I mean, replace family with children. I know it's slightly different and more dramatic, but if she is spending all this time with her dead husbands children, barely seeing her own children, and ignoring your children it shows its messed up. I'd say she needs to attend some grief counseling and be calmly and respectfully told she is not putting her 100% effort into her current relationship because of her last one. She is of course allowed to spend time with her ex's family because obviously they are close, but you'd want her to start building those bonds with your family too. You just need to remember, she was married to this guy. She was probably close with his family. You can't expect her to drop a big portion of her life because you think it's weird, because you cannot understand the nature of their relationship and the bond of a shared death. Be respectful of that and apologize for your comments. "
4,azbqau,t2_11kgk8,MaxSpringPuma,"NTA Definitely not the asshole for sending the whole family away. What the parents did was really shitty. About Chris coming over by himself thing, I'm not so sure. If he is a good kid, your family are not too put out by having to feed just him, and he and your son get along well, I wouldn't want to risk their friendship. I think for now you should keep the status quo. Maybe the parents got just as uncomfortable as you during the interaction and won't be trying it again. And if they do, have a quiet word to them without the kids around. "
4,azbqau,t2_ar609,Beep_boop_human,"NTA, you're not a soup kitchen. I grew up really poor and I don't believe the one thing between that family eating that night or not was showing up on their son's friend's doorstep and hoping his mother could spare four extra meals. Being broke doesn't make it okay to impose on someone like that. The father is a total asshole for at best not shutting his kids down, and at worst for coaching them to say that stuff."
4,azbqau,t2_lmusqvc,JCXIII-R,"NTA You're cooking for an extra teenager multiple times a week, that's already more than anyone can ask of you. My bff's mom has 4 kids of her own. They started bringing their friend over so much for dinner and everything, every now and then she misspoke and told people she had 5 kids. She didn't mind, but she did make him buy groceries every now and then after he turned 18, otherwise she just couldn't afford it, and I think that's reasonable."

""Oh thanks, I can give your parents the recipe, maybe they can make it for you some time."" It might get awkward if they don't take the hint but a little awkwardness doesn't kill anyone. And you could always just say that you've not made enough food (which is understandable with 4 unexpected visitors) if the situation lingers. However, I think effectively punishing your son (and Chris) because of this interaction makes you the asshole. Neither have done anything wrong but you're going to make it seem like they did. They're kids. Edit: there's also the possibility that they didn't try to invite themselves to dinner? A kid saying they're hungry or the food smells good is not a family asking to eat. Kids say stuff like that all the time. They don't sound like they were especially imposing or demanding or anything."
4,azbqau,t2_13v81yzn,CariadChavez,"YTA - You had me 100% on your team for the first half but lost me with telling poor, hungry people to order take out and then told your son to stop bringing Chris over so often, even though you said you were ""happy to feed one more mouth."" I get it, no one likes unexpected dinner guests, even if you live in a culture where that sort of the thing is the norm (I live in one now, and it definitely took some getting used to) but you could have handled it with so much more grace and compassion. And essentially punishing Chris for having a hungry family? I'm not sure that's a great look."
4,azbqau,t2_2g6ndyzr,yeahnahhhyeah,NTA. It’s not your job to feed them. My brother and I don’t always have a lot of money lying around and whenever his friends start talking about ordering expensive food he’s like “I’ll just pick up a $5 pizza next door”. We struggled a lot as kids but our parents never pulled something like this. We’ve grown from this experience and we know how to find the cheapest option. It’s just something you have to learn how to do.
4,azbqau,t2_30xjilcm,thejohnmc963,YTA - I know that’s not a popular thought but the parents didn’t ask for food. The sibling just said it smelled good. You rushed to judgement and said “take out it is and pushed them out the door “ You then say to your child to not to have a kid come over so often. My son and daughter had friends that were not fed well and we made sure they ate whenever they came over
4,azbqau,t2_tr871,OkCuspids,"YTA. Not for not feeding them - in fact, from your story, there doesn't even seem to be any indication you were even *asked* to feed anyone - but how you handled it. Seriously... you sound like not only an asshole, but some real next-level pretentious classist. They were never in there for food first of all, they just were picking up Chris and wanted to use the bathroom. All they did was comment on the aroma (a comment made by a CHILD), and your mind immediately got all defensive and panicky and jumped to conclusions. If I was just popping in somewhere to use the bathroom and there was a great smell in the air, sure if it was that good I'd probably comment on it. Doesn't mean I'm asking for anything, was probably just saying ""damn, Chris's friend's mom must be a good cook!"" A mere *complement* from a child had you all flustered. Let that sink in for a second. > As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. Again, said by a child, not a parent - probably just telling the parents they want to go home and eat rather than stick around and be chatty. When I was a kid my parents had a tendency to be chatty when we're on our way out from somewhere while I would patiently wait for them to finish. ""Mommy, this smell is making hungry let's go home"". > I diplomatically said that ""well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you"" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. > The father replied ""not really"" and looked away. > I said ""well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry."" and ushered them to the door. This is where your true colors start to show. Literally NO ONE asked you for anything, and you kinda put the parents in an awkward position with that comment when all they were doing was waiting for their kid to finish in the bathroom. > Since then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. Holy shit, THIS is where you sound like a real asshole, adding insult to injury like that when Chris didn't even do anything. Imagine how he would feel when your son tells him that. You ""don't want a repeat of Chris's family on the doorstep""... when all they did was say hello while wait for their kid in the bathroom? Even after Chris has been coming over for a while previously with no trouble whatsoever? Parents come in to say hi sometimes when picking their kid up from a playdate, why shouldn't they? Also, why is 'going to his place' included? Afraid of their family's 'inferiority' and poor-ness 'rubbing off' on your son? Honestly, based on how you constantly describe Chris and his family in this story as being ""poor"" and ""not well off"" several times, it seems like you look down on them and view them as inferior to the point of resentment and repulsion, and the egregious conclusions you jumped to that they were trying to 'mooch' off you just adds to that. Taking all that into account, along with your need to add insult to injury by laying down the law with your asinine restrictions on your son's hangout time with Chris alone, it also seems like their presence in your house *offends* you because of how 'inferior' they are and unworthy of having anything to do with you, much less set foot in the presence of Your Royal High-class-ness, and why it triggered that knee-jerk reaction and assumption. Lucky for you though, if Chris's parents have any self-respect, they probably don't wanna be anywhere near you either after how reprehensibly you treated them. So, congratulations. Seriously how are there so many NTA comments"
4,azbqau,t2_1455et,vero2017,"NTA- It sounds like they heard about your feeding Chris and thought that you would feed the whole family if they just hung out on your doorstep long enough. It is unrealistic for anyone to think that you would have that much prepared food on hand, or could afford to feed them. As to you deciding that you no longer feel like you want to include Chris so frequently in your family dinners, that is your right to make that call. From the information you provided it felt like his family was ready invite themselves for dinner and take advantage of the generosity you have shown their son, when the appropriate thing to do would have been to say Thank You! "
4,azbqau,t2_2frr9t5o,depestoreddit,"NAH - but I think you jumped to conclusions and probably embarrassed the family. They were being nice and complimentary of your home, that's polite. Kids say things all the time that embarrass parents, so the kids said they were hungry, it's not like the parents set him/her up to say that. My kids are very well fed and I could still see them saying something like this because they're kids. More appropriate comments would have been nothing, ""can I grab you a granola bar?"", ""I'm sorry I didn't make extra"", or if you were feeling generous maybe ""I'm sorry I didn't make extra but maybe we can have you guys all over for dinner sometime."" Saying 'I'm sure you have something nice at home' when it sounds like you probably know they didn't likely embarrassed the dad. I think his comment was out of that embarrassment, not a way to get invited to dinner. And then throwing in the takeout comment when that's expensive and you already mentioned they have finance issues feels like kicking them when they're down. Of course, none of us actually know the situation. There are definitely leeches out there. I hope that wasn't the case though and you are able to continue to give Chris a place he feels secure. Out of curiosity, is this a single dad situation? We had a family like that near us when we were growing up. The mom passed away unexpectedly when the kids were little. I think he tried his best but he worked full time and wasn't the best homemaker. The neighborhood kind of half adopted the kids and we all felt pretty good about that. "
4,azbqau,t2_gj2do,epicBaklava,"NTA, I came from a middle class family we had food no problem, but the home life was hell. I spent many weekends at friends houses and was feed. I am older, an adult now, and I look back and think man what a thing to do. These people were richer than us (upper middle - rich) but that doesnt matter. I shouldnt have been their burden on them because my family didnt want to hash out their own problems. Eventually the family owned a business and we would give them products in return.... many years later &#x200B; TL:DR I was chris once, now im an adult, and I see how rude it was of my parents to do that."
4,azbqau,t2_1k94yu2,lovemesomeotterz,"So you're NTA for shooing the family away because that is not your responsibility but YTA for telling your son to hang out with his best friend other places because he's poor. I know you don't want the family showing up but as an adult and a parent, you should just keep putting up with them for your son and keep politely declining if they keep inviting themselves into your home. And please take your judgement. I see everyone else commenting the same things and you keep saying "".....but I don't care if they hang out OTHER places."" No. That's why in this situation YTA and you asked for that judgement. My reasoning: 1) I was the poor kid. My family never did this to someone else but if I knew someone's mom didn't want me at their house because my family was poor and she might have to give me a snack, I'd think she was a total bitch and be shocked. Same if my mom did this to someone else. 2) You're going to regret turning away the opportunity to be the house your kids actually want to hang out at. Trust me, after I decided my friends parents were better to hang around than my parents, my parents begged me to bring my friends around the rest of my childhood - I never did. Maybe because my mom was judgy with my friends and I didn't appreciate it, it made me resentful. 3) You'd rather your kid wander around aimlessly than bring his friend home to the place he feels most safe and comfortable because you're worried that these people who've never showed up before are going to show up again. Seems like you're just being classist at that point. In all, no, you don't have to feed other mouths, you're right and I'm sorry. No, you can't discriminate against your kids best friend for being poor and idc if they have other places to hang out, you're wrong and I'm sorry. "
4,azbqau,t2_2ktm3y26,confusedspeckledcow,"NTA- I get it. I cant afford to feed everyone. But heres an idea. Offer Chris's mom some recipes. Maybe offer to help her find food banks, apply for food stamps. Which barely cover food for a family of 5. Offer to help them find resources. Maybe not monetary help. But help. You might get taken advantage of. But only once. Then end it. The kids where hungry. I would have fed the kids. And I bet Chris was mortified by the interaction as well. Edit to add. I have been so fucking broke I couldn't afford groceries. My husbands job transferred him to a very shitty shop where we made 1/4th of what we where making. But we didnt have the nessicary paperwork to get help. I have called friends for help. And in my better times, friends called me. I have invited whole families of friends of my kids over just because daddy lost his job. I feed people who need food because I have been there. I have bought full on groceries for people I barely talk to anymore. I have split what I had in my pantry. Food shouldnt be a divider. It should bring people together . "
4,azbqau,t2_88g5c,OPtig,"YTA Are you seriously so worked up that poor people came into your house, said it was beautiful and complimented your cooking? Your post is full of disdain and assumptions about their intentions. For all you know, their claim about needing the bathroom was legitimate and you just panicked, assumed they were freeloaders and rudely shoved them out of your home. Now you want to alienate Chris so a poor hungry family doesn't darken your doorstep again. You could definitely stand to humble your attitude."
4,azbqau,t2_4eehcdu,ecstaticegg,YTA Not because you should have fed them. I can see how you wouldn’t want to set a precedent or be taken advantage of. But they must have been desperate to come like that. You knew they couldn’t afford to get food and you suggested take out? Why would you do that? But the real reason YTA is because you told your son not to invite Chris over anymore. Because his family one time implied they needed food from you. That isn’t his fault and you’re an adult. If you’re so selfish that you’d tell your kid to bring his friend over less and you can’t see how that makes you the asshole I don’t know what to tell you. Tell your kid he can bring Chris over as much as he wants. If you can afford it maybe send him home with leftovers sometimes. You aren’t obligated to but if you can afford it I think it would be very kind. If you really want to go the extra mile I would look up nearby churches or charities that provide food and see if you can point them in this family’s direction. Some churches have programs where they deliver groceries to struggling families in a way that won’t publicly be visible so they won’t be embarrassed. Although this family seems beyond that point of desperation. Which should be a red flag for someone who isn’t selfish.
4,azbqau,t2_niron,OfficialModerator,"Eeesh, honestly I'm torn on this one. Feels like they had planned on getting a hot meal - perhaps they are freeloaders trying it on or perhaps they desperately needed help. Either way, you are not responsible for them so NTA however it is strange alright. "
4,azbqau,t2_l48ob,shushupbuttercup,"YTA. Same as all the other YTA votes: not for not feeding them. My perspective is that you're asking your son to push his good friend away because you're afraid that there might be another awkward encounter with the kid's parents. If it happens again, be an adult and be clear with the parents. My parents told me I couldn't go to a certain friend's house anymore because of once incident that wasn't dangerous but they just didn't like, and it totally killed the friendship. To this day, my mom says that she didn't intend for me to not continue the friendship, but that's what happens in this situation. Do you think Chris is gong to ever feel comfortable with your son after you force this issue? He'll feel like you're constantly judging and pitying him because his parents are poor and socially awkward. And your son will never forget that you responded by putting a wedge in his best friendship. "
4,azbqau,t2_1thb2jz8,happydactyl,"YTA for your response, not the broader sentiment. They didn’t ask for food and it wasn’t even the adults who commented on it. They might have been angling but that really wasn’t obvious, at least not from your description. You’re totally NTA for not just randomly feeding a family that showed up at your door - you’re not responsible for the sad situation of people you effectively don’t even know. But making that assumption and the accompanying awkward comments and (especially) telling your son that his friend can’t come around as much/at all makes it a YTA situation. "
4,azbqau,t2_xw5ny,fuzzyoctopus97,"NTA for not really wanting to feed an entire extra family unexpectedly, although no one actually asked to stay so I’m kind of iffy on that, however it’s sounds pretty messed up that you told your kid that his friend couldn’t come over to your house any longer just because of a single incident that he wasn’t even actually a part of. Saying you’d send them along a sandwich if they decided to hang out outside the house is still banning a kid from your house."
4,azbqau,t2_6lzgi,Beeb294,"NTA. There is a discussion here about doing the nice thing if a family is in need, but not going above and beyond doesn't make you an asshole. But if this family is having food security issues, you should try to guide them toward some form of help, or maybe notify the school to see if they have any programs to help out (many schools have a backpack program where they will send some food home over the weekends with kids- pasta, canned goods, etc.) If the school knows this family may be in need of such a program, they can get started with helping this family. "
4,azbqau,t2_4g81x,remedialrob,NTA because it was an awkward situation you didn't really have time to think about but... if your instinct is to protect something so small as a single meal or a bit of food over possibly poor/hungry people then you're not especially generous or giving beyond a certain point either. Which is fine. It speaks to the limits of your character that that is your impulse. But it doesn't make you an asshole. Just not an exceptionally good person. 
4,azbqau,t2_15vw4l,littleredteacupwolf,"NTA. I agree you could have worded it differently, but it’s also really weird that everyone had to come pick Chris up around dinner time (after I’m sure he’s talked about the yummy food he gets there) and then they all got out of the car for one kid needing to go to the bathroom? Nah, that was hinky. But I don’t think you should uninvite Chris because of his parents actions."
4,azbqau,t2_12iwvs,Lion12341,"NTA. It's good manners to offer your guests food, but the rest of his family weren't actually intended to be your guests for that day. The only way they could have eaten in that scenario whilst maintaining some good manners is if you offered them to join you. You didn't really have any obligations to feed them. Try to keep the status quo though. It would be really sad for both Chris and your son if you tried to push them away because of one awkward encounter with Chris' family."
4,azbqau,t2_2pmodwnm,SkyGamer0,"NTA. you dont want to feed an extra 4 mouths in your own home, but i feel like you could have handled it better.

4,azbqau,t2_3dyrylw0,GinTrouble,"NTA but possibly about to become YTA I’ve got an Aunt and Uncle like this, except they’re not poor, they’re just cheap. The always rock up at meal times and awkwardly stay and talk about how hungry they are until they get fed. They also remind you that nieces birthday was 2 months ago, and even if you didn’t get her a present that’s fine she’ll be happy with cash, and oh, I see you’ve got the DVD of that show, oh we’ve been wanting to see that desperately, if only we had the DVD like you have... you’ve finished watching it right? And so on and so forth. And it’s all said in suggestions, boxing you in so the only polite response is to give them what they want or seem like a cow (I often seem like a cow). I love them and all, but you can definitely tell when someone is angling for something in a convo, and I’ve no doubt you were right about the family wanting dinner, and well within your right to say no to feeding 4 extra people. HOWEVER Chris is innocent, Chris is in a difficult spot, and the actions you take now can make a huge difference to how his life turns out. Be that third parent, that invisible support for him. You may not be directly responsible for him, but morally he is a child in need, and you have the capacity to help. When I was growing up we frequently had my brothers friends end up living with us for times when their own family situations got rough, and there was always a seat at the table and an extra loaf of bread in the kitchen for any hungry kid to eat without asking. It kept those kids out of trouble and quite frankly stopped any of those kids from dragging my siblings and I into trouble. And a secure older kid will in turn take care of their siblings. So help Chris get through his education by treating him as one of your own with his own place at your table, and you will end up helping his siblings, as well as keeping your own son out of trouble. Plus, it’s the kind thing to do. "
4,azbqau,t2_2hl1gk5x,pacingpilot,"YTA, kinda. You have assumed the worst of this family and the father without any concrete knowledge of what their situation is other than they aren't as well off as you. Your son obviously has a strong friendship with Chris so would it really be a major inconvenience to get know his family a little if for no other reason than to better understand the dynamics of a child your own child spends so much time with? Maybe the dad sucks, I dunno. Maybe they are good people in a bad spot and you'd be able to help them...not with food from your own pantry but maybe by guiding them to community resources that can better help them. Of course you are under no obligation to help them but would it be the worst if you made an attempt to find out a little more about this family and if circumstances allowed, give them a little help or guidance? It could all start with an invitation to dinner, a ""hey, our kids spend so much time together, I'd like to get to know your family a little if that's okay?""

I realise this way of thinking isn't super popular in the states but in my opinion if it doesn't hurt you to be selfless you should do so, regardless of whether it lets some asshole off the hook.

Hell, a while ago I visited my parents without calling first (they live near the cinema so after I see a movie I just pop in and say hi) and my mom was cooking. And she said ""you should have told me you were coming, now I don't have enough for all three of us"". And you know what? She was right. I was not offended. I shrugged and went home. I'm a grownup, I wasn't planning on staying for dinner and I don't expect her to give me her food. Also, a few years ago a good friend of me and my sister had a hard time at home, coming out of the closet to Christian parents and all, so he would come over on Friday night and occasionally stay for dinner. Eventually he dropped by Every. Friday. Afternoon. For dinner. This lasted about four years. So once you invite them over for dinner, they'll just keep coming. Sounds harsh, but it really limits your freedom that day. "
4,azbqau,t2_28rylpsp,Quick_Temperature,"YTA. This is for one simple reason you are punishing your son and chris becuse of the familly. There is no need to stop him coming over, if his familly did it again you could talk it out with the farther but from the sounds of it I dought it will be a common occurrence as there plan just failed so miserably. I think your NTA on how you acted on the day its self, what they did was rude and a obvious plan to get some food. I dissagree with people who said the ""take out it is"" comment was classist, it was the least awkward thing to say after that."
4,azbqau,t2_3t2qd2x,bindhast,"There is a cultural component to this . In India, YTA for sure. Food is shared and liberally. The way I imagine the scenario playing out in India is - the host *insisting* that they stay for dinner. And then, the two moms scuttling to the kitchen , with one serving to the families and the other making something else quickly to accommodate more mouths. Sending some one out hungry at dinner time would be... unimaginable. Related but not really- when we would travel in train and had brought in packed lunch , you would offer the people sitting next to you as you had your own. At times- offer them first before you have it yourself. "
4,azbqau,t2_27ofar51,TheNightmanCometh462,"YTA. Hungry people came to your house, one of them is a friend of your son. You could have fed them but decided not to and then took steps to ensure that their son is no longer welcome at your house because he’s hungry. How dare he be a hungry child in your presence?! When he grows up he could’ve had an amazing story about his friend’s house where he could get a good meal when his family was going through some hard financial times and he was going hungry often. Now he will have a story about feeling like a burden on some lady because he was hungry and that his family was sent away hungry and disinvited from going back to his “friend’s” house afterwards... because he was guilty of being hungry. Things you could’ve done instead: 1- fed them all and made them feel welcome 2- made some more food to ensure everyone could eat, get to know them better. 3- give them some money for take out or groceries. 4- order food in or have it delivered to their house. 5- discuss with their parents about if they’re having financial difficulties and see if you can help them find a job or point them in the direction of resources to help them get food. We had a house in our town where kids knew they could go if they were hungry. My buddy’s mom would feed anyone and everyone who walked through their door. They were not rich (far from it) and they had 6 boys of their own on a $30,000 a year salary. But she ALWAYS fed every single person who stopped by. Dozens of kids have grown up with nothing but fond memories of this house and the love and kindness they felt there. There are very few worse things I can think of that we can do to our fellow beings than sending them away hungry. Especially if you have more than enough. To top it off, ensuring that their son is no longer welcome at your house in order to prevent you from feeling put out again just makes me cringe. Disgusting behavior. I hope you’re never in a position like they are now, but maybe then you’d learn something. But I doubt it. You are definitely the ass hole. I hope your kids grow up to treat others better than their mom does. I’d be ashamed of my mother if she did this. "
4,azbqau,t2_7v4z9,tygaismydog,YWBTA. So I was leaning in on nta because it’s not your job nor responsibility to feed Chris. However you will be the asshole if you push him away from your sons life. Even small things like not having him for dinner are going to make him feel uncomfortable towards you. You’re not an asshole for not feeding him but you are an asshole for pushing them out of the house. If I where you I would invite Chris over for dinner while he’s hanging out with your son. To be honest based on your replies I think you’re a bit paranoid. Unless this has happened multiple times I doubt the dad will be back tbh. And if I recall correctly it wasn’t even the dad that asked for food. He obviously was embarrassed as well because he looked away. NTA for not feeding YWBTA If you mess up your kids friendship. 
4,azbqau,t2_yvq2f,Red_Rocket_Rider,"NTA for not wanting to feed the family, but kinda YTA for not wanting your son to bring Chris home, especially that's one of the only ways for him to get a proper meal. My step mom has 3 kids in the same age range too and the second oldest also has a poorer friend that spends most of his time at their place and I always found it comendable that she fed him too, as if he was her own son. Although it's not your duty to feed Chris, I do think it would be the right thing to do"
4,azbqau,t2_dkkce,poltyy,"NTA But I don’t think you’re a great person either, it’s not great behavior. What you’re doing to Chris is deeply unkind, although you really have no obligation to him or his family. You have a chance to change a kid’s life by modeling a stable family home, good nutrition, and kindness. Instead you’re distancing him so that you don’t have to possibly experience an uncomfortable moment with his parents. You’re a grown up, you have the mental wherewithal to BE uncomfortable, resolve situations in a responsible manner, and come to terms with situations instead of avoiding them. You’re supposed to be able to use that to teach the next generation how to adult. And instead you are teaching your own child, who I guarantee knows what is going on, poor adult behavior and nothing about conflict resolution."
4,a4l295,t2_l7t0s,gooberfaced,"NTA. Unsolicited advice is almost never welcome no matter who is dishing it out. You need to communicate with her.

After two or three times it turns into nagging and I'm sure you don't mean to do that."" >has even started yelling at me about it. That is unacceptable. If you ask her nicely to stop and she refuses then it's up to you whether or not to continue the relationship. If she is this controlling now just imagine how bad it will get after you've been together a few years."
4,a4wbsd,t2_8bp1h,dudelikeshismusic,"NTA for morbid curiosity IMO. If you went out of your way and somehow got hold of the tapes through illegal means or something like that then YTA, but being interested in dark world events doesn't make you an asshole."

4,b67ghb,t2_g7knv1f,jolie178923-15423435,"I think YTA but only mildly so (because I think everyone understands wanting to look good at work and advance). yes, your son won't remember it, but it's also his first birthday party. It's not unreasonable of your wife to want you to let your boss know this is a prior engagement that you can't miss. also, this part honestly rubs me the wrong way a little bit: >Frankly I feel like this party is for her rather than my son. Shown only more so by the fact that the overwhelming majority of the people invited are her side of the family and her girlfriends. If it was truly for my son, who will have no memories of this event, then surely the other side of his family would have been given more thought. so...get involved and talk to your wife about the guest list? You have agency and two hands, text your family and friends and invite them? is your wife *refusing* to allow you to invite your side of the family, or...? **Edit:** and I agree with people who point out that dropping something as important as your son's first birthday party to fill a shift at work might not make you look like a great candidate for advancement - rather, it might end up just making you look like a pushover, a patsy. Now that kind of thing is obviously highly dependent on the unique interpersonal dynamics of your workplace, and it may *not* be the case here - but I've seen situations like yours play out like that. "
4,b67ghb,t2_34a7644g,dennisisabadman2,"YTA, if you wanted your friends and family there you should have invited them, it's not just up to the mum to sort it out. You have to decide whats more important to you on that day I. E. your work or family, your son won't actually remember this party so he's not going to be dissapointed, but your wife and family will be. What time is the party? It's pretty incredible all those people got time off for your son's first birthday, kudos to your wife it might not be possible to get them all there if you change the time. "
4,b67ghb,t2_1xrkm221,shugamuff1534,"NTA - it’s reasonable for you to want to be a good employee and impress your boss. This is an opportunity for better things to come and more security for your family. The fact that your wife can’t see the bigger picture and the implications of your actions beyond this one party is unfair. Also, I don’t know why everyone keeps stressing FAMILY FIRST as if that’s always right. It’s not. You have to take each decision as it comes and this is a fair one to deliberate. It’s potentially a chance to show your work you are enthusiastic, dedicated, and reliable...and that means a fucking lot! It gives you more grounds to ask for a raise or set your own path etc etc....Sorry reddit, work matters and family can’t trump work 100 percent of the time. 😬 Your wife enjoys the benefits of you working (paycheck to live) so she should fully support you keeping that part of your life as healthy as possible...because none of you can eat if you don’t! Within reason of course!!!! Also, you’re still showing up to the party, just a bit later. She can still have her all day party and mingle all she wants without you there; why does she care if you come later? You guys don’t need to change the party time to accommodate your work. Try to get her to express what she REALLY WANTS out of this party. I’m pretty sure your presence is lower in the totem pole than just having a successful party. I can relate to your wife because I get attached to a thing I want to do too and get mad about plans changing. The changing of plans ALWAYS BOTHERS ME. But I’ve learned over time that it just adds stress and unhappiness and there is no reason to be attached to things happening a certain way sooooooo much that it’s going to ruin my mood all day. Just roll with the punches man. I struggle to keep this perspective but when I do, my life is a lot easier. "
4,b67ghb,t2_221d0jl2,bristly_hedgehog,"NTA. You’re not missing the party entirely. And you said in the comments this is a tumultuous time at your work. Your manager is leaving, two people were let go. Sometimes moving up is about being in the right place at the right time, and this could be it. You aren’t missing the whole party! You can still be there for the important parts. Sometimes “family first” means *take care* of family first. More money = a better life for your wife and child. I find it hard to believe your wife can’t compromise *at all* and that is what makes her the asshole here. "
4,b67ghb,t2_9n8ju,GingerZarah,"NTA You are totally right in saying the party is not for your son. First birthdays are totally for the parents, yay this fragile tiny life with suicidal tendencies has lived thru the first year! That being said I do think you would regret missing the party. There will be other opportunities to show your boss your commitment to your job, but you wont ever get another first birthday. "
4,b67ghb,t2_3f8j5gww,kittykatband,"NTA. I understand family comes first and you obviously won't get fired for not showing up on a requested day off; but your wife needs to understand that if you go, you can support your family more. You want to further your career and everyone knows first birthdays are just for the parents to show off. The people saying you're TA are mostly likely college students who've never worked or privileged people who can switch careers like nothing. They don't understand that you ""sacrificing"" the first few hours of your kids birthday (who won't remember) will pay off down the road when you are making more money and can afford more for your family.

Missing important events in your family's life won't move you up the corporate ladder, it'll just tell your boss he can get you to cover anything he needs.

Encourage your friend to tell her mother about it. Talk to a trusted adult about it. But your friend likely needs support. And that’s okay to be there for her. I was 17 and in a relationship with a much older man. I look back on that relationship with disgust. I was taken advantage of. I wasn’t old enough to consent. I didn’t know any better. But he should have. When you are 31 you are in a VERY different place in life than a 17 y/o. They can have a shot at it when a 14 year age gap isn’t such a significant developmental gap. "

I wouldn’t even regularly hang out with 17 year olds, and I would absolutely never date one. There is just so much that fundamentally changes in a person between those two ages. Sure, a 14 year age gap isn’t gross or creepy *per se*, but 17 to 31 is **not** the same as 30 to 44. This is predatory behavior, this guy knows better and your friend isn’t mature enough to realize how creepy this really is. *Why is this 31 year old adult hanging out with high school kids, and more importantly why is he trying to date one...?* She *thinks* she knows what she’s doing and that everything is great, but this relationship, and I would bet everything I own and all of my money (hell, throw in my 401k, too), *will not last,* and in 5 years she’s going to be so creeped out that she dated him, and you’re going to understand why I’m saying this is creepy.

4,an6bw0,t2_a7rap,MadtownMaven,"NTA - The gals seemed to have made assumptions that it would be only women in the room. If that was a deal breaker for them, they should have confirmed it prior to committing. The husband staying is a non-issue. That's just not appropriate for what is a school related conference. If they want to get a free mini-vacation out of it, they should put up for a hotel room on their own dime. A fellow student (even if not in the exact same cohort) who is attending the conference for the purpose of the conference definitely outranks a spouse who will not be attending the conference. (Like seriously, what would the hubby be doing while you were all at the conference?)"
4,an6bw0,t2_vqrr6,TheMaStif,"NTA Although you should probably have told the ladies, when you agreed for them to stay in your room, that you had also invited men to stay there as well, just so they would be aware of it ahead of time. But they shouldn't have assumed that was the case, and they certainly have no right to complain, given this is YOUR room and you're simply extending a courtesy. If anything, I would even go as far as saying you have the right to tell Debby and Claire that THEY need to find other accommodations since Eric and Frank have no problems with sharing the room, it's Claire and Debbie who are causing trouble, and whoever sleeps in your room is entirely for YOU to decide, for any reason whatsoever"

Don’t know why she’s even angry. The women are not being asked to share beds with the men. If they were, maybe it’d be a different story. Personally, as a woman, I have no problems staying in a mixed room. However, I’m used to this as I’ve stayed in mixed room hostels before. I can see why it could be a big deal for someone who has never done it before, but still, that’s not really your problem."

Seems like you are the most mature out of the bunch, and it is okay for a woman to not want to stay with a man out of comfortability, but to assume that you held those values because of an isolated incident (you telling Brent he cant come, which had nothing to do with him having a penis) is foolish on them."
4,an6bw0,t2_4jqq0,madevilfish,"NTA- No good deed goes unpunished. Perhaps you should have made it clear in the group message that you would have the room would be first, for your cohort only and unisex. And whatever spots were not filled up by the cohort would go to other people aka Frank. (But you wouldn't have known that anyway.) It sounds like Debby and Claire need to relax about the room being coed. You're all in grad school, not middle school. It's not going to be a fuck fest in there. (Even if conferences get crazy.)

For all you know she's been a problem employee for a long time and you'll give them the excuse to do what they've already been wanting to do based on all sorts of other shit she's doing. If this is her only issue if they're good people they'll talk to her about it and resolve the issue between them. The even more likely scenario is they'll tell you ""we'll look into it"" and absolutely nothing will happen beyond that. &#x200B; All of the above is not your problem though. If you go looking to put your nose into the specific manner in which they deal with their employee (fire her, don't fire her, train her with this specific program, etc), that's not your business, and you're the asshole.

A simple statement in Korean the next time you're at the register either 1) thanking her for not being catty *this time* or 2) letting her know you've understood it all the entire time and don't want to risk her getting fired if you tell her manager she's being such a brat at her till may do the trick. She's presumably, if not an adult, at least old enough to shut her damn mouth without much prompting.

She could at least have the courtesy of letting you know she's going to cancel or likely to cancel beforehand. Being a regular flake is how you find yourself without any close friends. 
4,avujoj,t2_28dk2fkj,Delanes_Brain,"NTA: If it was a one time thing sure, understandable. But communication is key and her doing this multiple times without any word or explanation as to why she decided just not to show is really unfair to you. You had no idea what was going on with her (if there actually is or its just an excuse) because she isn't communicating those things to you. Can't be a mind reader."
4,avujoj,t2_12202f,peanutbuttershrooms,"NTA - even if someone in her family died she could probably shoot you a text mid cry. My BFs cousin is super bad about that. We have him over for dinner every Friday (and sometimes Saturday) night. Sometimes he'll just fall asleep and not show up or take 3 hours longer to get to our house (5 min. away) and not say shit about it then come over and smoke our weed and take our dabs. It's really not cool. Especially because it's happened before, theres really no way you're the asshole. She just sucks. Even if she has super bad anxiety or something she could at least make up other excuses beforehand to not come over. There's really no excuse for ghosting or not communicating with someone you made plans with."
4,b01xst,t2_20izeepz,annizoli,"NTA She was probably expecting you to flounder and then she’d swoop in and make it better. You really surprised her by opening up and making friends with her friends, and she’s a bit thrown by it. Whether she’s being malicious or just doesn’t know how to deal with the complete 180 of her expectation I’m not entirely sure, but she handled it poorly enough to warrant a NTA instead of NAH."
4,b01xst,t2_i5du4,Perthcrossfitter,"NTA ! Was in a similar situation with my now wife when we were younger, where she encouraged me to be more social. The only difference in my story is that she was happy for me when her friends enjoyed my company - which is exactly what I would expect of a partner who wants you to succeed social and break out of their shell. Good on you for breaking out of your comfort zone. Also, TIL Urban exploration is a thing."
4,b01xst,t2_2krlgsu2,Ebox3rchamp,"NTA sounds like immaturity on her part. U didn’t do a darn thing wrong. She will get over it, and if she’s doesn’t and this happens again u two need to have a serious talk about making and KEEPING joint friends and going out together. As my husband always says to our kids and his different mother: find ways to fit in not keep yourself out. "
4,b01xst,t2_3qij4,whooyeah,"NTA In my day we just got drunk and made obnoxious fools of ourselves.Kids of today are so complex.Sounds like it worked out for you and congrats on that small victory.You did nothing wrong.Sound like your GF may be more insecure in other ways. Next time maybe make it about her. Do you read philosophy? I think you would enjoy reading about Jean Paul Sartre and his idea that we all have a problem where we can never be for other people who we are (or think we are) for ourselves. And there is an eternal agony and anxiety in trying to figure out how to achieve this.Another guy Emmanuel Levinas proposed combating this by first showing complements observations and asking questions of other people and they will reflect that good wished back on you like a mirror. I once dated a girl whose father was a famous director and mother was a famous actress. I ended up at a dinner at their house where the table was full of celebrities and I was an early 20s nobody. But her mother introduced me as this up and coming dj who was doing amazing things on the music scene. Through the night people asked me what music I loved and why, and they appreciated my answers with what could only be honest enthusiasm. I realised that they really appreciated each other, for their art and the beautiful things that made them human. I had always noticed that this girl would always ask people a question and was interested like a person who had been without water for a week and the next thing out of that person's mouth would be flow of cool water. People were magnetically drawn to her. She didn't have to say anything profound, amazingly funny or witty. But she made people feel good. The easy fix for you is next time ask someone in the group if they like something your gf is good at or even just into. Then go on how you were amazed at her natural skill level. Or maybe just bring up conversation topics she is into. I'm sure you can both shine."
4,b01xst,t2_2bn9nezk,hazelchicken,"**NTA** congrats man, sounds like you had a great night :) just because they are her friends doesn't mean that she needs to be the star of the show. it sucks being pushed out of a conversation, but... sometimes that just happens, especially when you're quiet. Its the one event, if it were every time you went out that'd be a different story. To feel a little sad is ok but if she is actually blaming you for just something to utterly normal... shes not right. You tried to bring her in, which is all you can do. Conversations can go quickly, to quickly to always ""hold the door open"", and you can only bump the door open for someone - they also need to wedge it over with their own foot in order to come on. "
4,b01xst,t2_2ytgt21z,IMNOTDEFENSIVE,"NTA It seems to me that she's dating you BECAUSE you have anxiety. It sucks that people glorify mental illness, but many people want someone who they feel bad for, because it makes them seem like a better person then they really are. They want the reassurance of knowing their partner is not as social as them and therefore, will not be able to find anyone better, or find friends. Think about it, if you have friends that means she gets less attention. I have social anxiety too, and it's very clear that this is abuse. If she loved you, she would encourage you to be the best version of yourself. Instead, she wants you to be quiet enough so that you are dependent on her. In order to do this, she makes you feel as if you have done something wrong socially because she KNOWS it will hurt you and push you back into isolation. I had a friend of mine who did this, she would look at me as if I was talking too much and would criticize anything I said because she was afraid I was getting too much attention. She went on to spread rumors about me that I ""wasn't really shy"" because in her mind, if I was shy, I could never contribute to a conversation as much as she did. She was only friends with me because she wanted friends who accepted her as the dominant ""Regina George"" ""above everyone else"" type-girl. That ended up pushing me into the worst isolation I've ever been in in my life, I spent my last 3 years of high school sitting alone and not talking or engaging with anyone. That was exactly what she wanted, and it messed me up so much I needed therapy. I felt my opinions were not wanted. And even now, I'm in college, have new friends and a job that I love, but I am still constantly worried that people dont like me."
4,b01xst,t2_107mub,ScarletFeverOrYellow,"NTA She's being narcissistic. Most people would be ecstatic that their partner is getting along so well with their friends (especially if the partner is so introverted). Also, consider this: does she tell you that you're a 'social neanderthal' or is that something you tell yourself? It's not a positive-sounding phrase, and it sounds like you're happy to talk when you're interested and feel comfortable."
4,b01xst,t2_2xl5x45g,Trivial_Punishment,"NTA. The ""Spotlight""?? You're out with her friends, why does she need to be in ""the spotlight"". It sounds as though you got on well with them which is, presumably, what she wanted. I would say well done for going out of your comfort zone and managing to find a common ground to bond with them over. You've spoken about how you don't trust your own social etiquette but it sounds like she has her own problems with it. "
4,b01xst,t2_126jimbk,Hangry_Squirrel,"NTA. I would have been so proud of you. You did nothing wrong and you shouldn't feel reluctant to go to other meet-ups. But perhaps you could join some groups centered around your own interests and go without her. The nice thing about meeting strangers is that they don't know you're supposed to be ""a social Neanderthal"" and you can try on a more social self when around them. Also, based on your account here, it doesn't sound like you don't understand social etiquette. I wonder how you developed some of these ideas: has someone told you repeatedly you're socially inadequate? were you always around idiots who thought making small talk was the epitome of socialization? have you ever had a friend with whom you could talk for hours? I used to think I was charmless and introverted because I'd never enjoyed large gatherings and the sort of pointless chatter which dominates them. Now I can do it easily if necessary, but it bores me to death. However, at some point, I realized I was very good at talking to people one-on-one, including those who didn't normally communicate much, and that I could keep a conversation going with anyone. I still think of myself as being closer to the introverted end of the spectrum, but I don't see it as a bad thing: I choose my social encounters carefully and don't waste energy on those I know I don't personally enjoy. I'll be honest: I don't like your girlfriend's reaction. I don't like the fact that maybe she uses you to feel good about herself and that she resented you for having a successful evening. I don't like the way she made it all about herself, when she should have been glad to see you come out of your shell and make a good impression on other people she likes. This deserves a conversation, but not one in which you're endlessly apologizing just to appease her."
4,b01xst,t2_16j6xvs1,musicalphoenix10,"NTA. She is just upset that, for a night, you were able to be engaged with a group of people when usually it is her bringing you out of your shell. The sudden shift, because of an interesting topic for you, might have been a shock to her and made her jealous that you were able to have a discussion with friends she could not. That doesn't give her the right though to then say you one-upped her, that's just being selfish. Instead she should be proud that you were able to be yourself. Maybe there were social cues you missed that irritated her more, but that seems like something she would be able to recognize as a missed social cue rather than you trying to alienate her since you are dating."
4,b01xst,t2_ehvq7,power602,"NTA. She is very selfish, it ruined her evening because you were having a good conversation with her friends? Any SO should be ecstatic that their friend get along with their SO, but instead she hated it because she is self centered. I would talk this out with her and hopefully she realizes she's being a huge asshole. If she doesn't, I would reconsider your relationship. As of right now, she would rather you be quiet and uncomfortable than for her to not have the attention of her friends (which they tried to bring her in to the conversation so?). How awful."
4,b01xst,t2_26i4uwz3,KombatKrazy,"NTA - And... what in the hell. Man now she really messed with your head. In a relationship there is no ""spotlight stealing or overshadowing"". Maybe you should let her know that her ""pep talk"" really helped and you were only chiming in on a topic you really enjoy and are passionate about. She shouldn't feel that way and she should be more encouraging/supportive of the evening. She should've just shrugged it off as a win for you, her and her friends. You finally got to be you and now she's taking that away from you. She made it about her when she shut down, not your fault."
4,b01xst,t2_mppgt,CSGOmar,"NTA. I usually really don't like when people on this sub take a small issue and make it grounds for breaking up, and I'm not saying to do that, but you should have a long think about the fact that she's basically revealed to you that she likes the fact that you're socially awkward, not because she likes you for you or even wants to help, but because she wants to easily feel superior in social situations. Just food for thought. "
4,b01xst,t2_16zzh67m,mcgar1,"NTA was the intent for the outing for everyone to have a good time with good conversation or for certain people to be in the ‘spotlight’. Her intentions toward this gathering sound like no one was going to be the winner unless she somehow was the center of attention while not having much of interest to contribute. 🤷‍♀️ I’m not saying this small argument is something to break a relationship but it does indicate that she’s possibly immature, has little self awareness, and isn’t one to support others. I would take it as a red flag and be on the look out for more of those flags. Don’t tie yourself down to someone that isn’t interested in evolving. "
4,b01xst,t2_e6w6r,Squiggy226,"NTA She should be proud and happy for you. You did something difficult for you and succeeded. She should be thrilled that you fit in with her group of friends. It almost makes me wonder if part of the reason she decided to be with you was (maybe subconsciously) thought she could be the ""star"" in the relationship and outshine you all the time. That's probably reading too deep into it but I find her reaction a bit weird. "
4,b01xst,t2_2crjxyo9,smellygymbag,"Nta, i think.. Its possible she was sort of counting your meekness to keep her feeling better about herself. but i have a feeling us commenters would have had to have been there to really see you in action to see if you did possibly inadvertently ""take over"" even if it was welcome by others in the convo. I would have gone with INFO but the info id want would be more specifics of what upset her, which im guessing you dont have. I give her the benefit of the doubt, and leave the door open to the possibility you might have screwed up, mostly because some introverts can be socially awkward, or off putting in subtle ways, maybe just because of a lack of practice. She might also just have had an overly negative response because she wasnt ready for the social energy you brought since you say shes an introvert too. Id just try to talk it out with her."
4,b01xst,t2_1kvh347u,Balla1928Aus,"NTA. I quite often get called a “quiet person” and have felt that some (definitely not most) people start to expect that of you and begin to dominate all conversations. Most of the time that is fine, but on rare occasions when I do have a lot to say, they can have difficulty sitting back and letting me rave on. Maybe your girl was going through this but still she shouldn’t pout. Next time you’re all together they’ll probably be talking about entirely different things and you will end up being more in the background. "
4,b01xst,t2_2wmq2tyd,annoyed68,"NTA She’s throwing a tantrum because deep down, though she’s been outwardly encouraging you, she now feels threatened to see you actually doing better. It’s a power trip for her to know that you don’t do as well as her in a social environment. I’m not saying she’s doing it maliciously but I do think she views you a little as her “pet project” and she’s gotten used to the way the relationship is with her being the “outgoing” one. This is one of those things you’re gonna have to talk with her about and let her know that you will be growing and trying new things and she can’t act like this every time the attention isn’t on her. Best of luck, OP"
4,b01xst,t2_tvpc7,oldcreaker,"NTA: that's really kind of selfish of her. The conversation turns to a passion you have something to talk about and she gets upset? Did she even have anything to offer on that particular subject? What should have happened is her sitting back for a bit and being happy you were enjoying what would normally be a very uncomfortable situation for you. If she expects you to be ""the quiet one"" 100% of the time, you might want to reexamine your relationship."
4,b01xst,t2_7861nye,poptart_divination,"NTA. I have a socially awkward boyfriend with some serious anxiety and I'm a somewhat more social introvert. I've been encouraging my boyfriend to be more social and to come out of his shell, and there is literally no situation where I'd be bothered by him actually doing it. Any success for him is a success for me, too. I don't think she's necessarily one of those people that wants to come off as some sort of saint for dating someone that's a bit of a project, but she's definitely the asshole on this situation. I would suggest you talk with her and find out why she feels overshadowed. It could be an ongoing thing for her and that night just happened to be the tipping point (making it a forgivable offense), or it could be that she's actually kind of a dick and you'd be better off re-entering the dating scene. "
4,b01xst,t2_7yzqdg4,ImAtW0rkBr0,"NTA. You did nothing wrong, she's pusher her insecurities off on you and making you feel like a Jerk. In reality she prefers to be the center of attention and when that's taken away she doesn't know what to do with herself. IMO she should have been happy for you and proud of you for overcoming your social anxiety. I think you should sit her down and ask her why she feels the way she does and what she realistically expected you to do when her friends began conversing with you."
4,b01xst,t2_137dubho,etiquette-peach,"NTA- I don’t know what the rest of your relationship has been like so I really don’t want to jump to any conclusions. But this story makes it sound like you’re Amy’s pet project. It sounds, to me, like she enjoys that you have trouble in social situations and likes being better at them than you, and when you actually did well, it was a challenge to her. I hope that’s not the case. But please look at your relationship and see if this is a pattern with Amy- is she focused on ‘fixing’ you? Does she compare her social skills to yours often? Does she always need to be the center of attention?"
4,b01xst,t2_11lidu,IndigoKitti79,"NTA, and time to really take a hard look at your relationship. Does she love you, or does she love caring for you? It sounds like she expected awkward moments where she'd have to cover for you (and shine to the crowd as the caring girlfriend), and that she'd have to reassure you after the fact, further cementing herself as ""the one"" who cares. I may be completely wrong, but her reaction is completely off base and is exactly what has me thinking in this direction. Also, your social and anxiety issues sound like something you might want to take to therapy. You may just have generalized anxiety, but some of your social issues sound like possible Asperger's. There is no shame in looking into these things, and it may just be helpful overall."
4,b01xst,t2_2wwbyf7z,luceringuera,"NTA- How awesome for you! You did great! A partner who doesn't support another partner when they thrive will only hold you back. She wanted to bring her quiet boyfriend to be in the background not the super charismatic guy who ever one wants to know. Careful, have a serious talk about your dynamic alone and as a couple in the real world."
4,b01xst,t2_12gmqj,Dogzillas_Mom,"NTA. You didn't do anything wrong. She's been loving this whole ""my BF is socially awkward"" thing because it focuses the attention on her. Because you felt comfortable in this situation and engaged socially (sounds like you were delightful and now I want your number too!), now she feels insecure. Maybe she's been feeling a bit superior to you or she has broken bird syndrome (where she wants to fix other people's flaws to avoid working on her own). "
4,b01xst,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"NTA What. The. Fuck. She convinced you to overcome your social anxiety and meet your friends. She was supportive. And then when you got there, you made connections and had a great conversation. Everyone loved you. So she's jealous and spiteful? That is petty, immature, and manipulative. She's acting like a child. And making your anxiety worse. She needs to apologize or you're never going out with her and a group again, and that's on her. "
4,b01xst,t2_2uhsibx4,PhoebeReeves25,"NTA. She sounds a little narcissistic if I'm honest. Like she enjoys the fact that you're introverted because it means she always gets the spotlight, and so was upset when you actually got a word in. If this was a healthy relationship she should have been proud or at least pleased for you that you made friends and stuff. Not upset."
4,b01xst,t2_13i4kv,ltfsufhrip,"NTA you got a ""life of the party"" moment because you met some people you jelled with and they loved to hear your input! Don't apologize for that or feel bad. She should be happy for you or proud that her boyfriend took a major step forward and was great in a social situation. Very selfish of your GF, and quite frankly just unreasonable in general. "
4,b01xst,t2_37ul1n1p,Budsygus,"NTA She's moving the goal posts. She set an expectation and when you met that expectation she changed it. She's almost certainly not doing this on purpose, but it's not fair to you at all. You had a good time and didn't mean to eclipse her. While you aren't in the wrong here, you can still make some changes to smooth things over: 1) Don't let talking about your passions take over the conversation (I'm super guilty of this and my wife has to rein me in all the time). 2) Recognize when you've been talking for a while then let someone else take over. 3) Most importantly do more asking than you do talking. I learned this when I had to attend networking events for work. I hated them until I realized I don't actually need to talk in order to make a good impression. People love talking about themselves and if you ask good questions they will love you for it. ""What do you do? Oh, cool! How did you get into that?"" Boom, they're spilling their life story and you're actively listening (eye contact, nodding, etc.) right along. By the end of their story you know enough about them to ask a followup question. Bonus is it's easier to give GF more attention if you're in question-asking mode so she doesn't feel left out. ""Hey, don't you know someone who does that? Who was that?"" and boom she's in the conversation. From one asocial introvert to another, you can get VERY good at these situations if you do some reading and get some practice. I figured it out and so can you."
4,b01xst,t2_a6l77wk,99Orange,"NTA - What?! My first instinct is to say your gf is a petty little bitch, but because I like to give people the benefit of the doubt I thought about it further. Maybe the reason she enjoys the relationship is because she appreciates the dynamic of you being the quiet introvert which allows her to shine. She, being an introvert herself, may feel like it makes her seem more outgoing when with someone much more introverted and because you finally found a situation in which you came out of your shell, she in turn felt like she then came off as the anxiety ridden introvert she’s been trying not to be. Regardless, this is her problem, not yours. She needs to recognize that the emotions she felt have to do with her own self esteem and you aren’t responsible for making her feel bad. Bottom line, you should never have to hold yourself back to make someone else feel more confident. Next time she leaves a social gathering feeling bad about herself she needs to look in the mirror and figure out how to navigate that rather than pointing the finger at you. You did nothing wrong. As a fellow social Neanderthal I commend you for finding the courage to join in the conversation. Your gf needs to learn how to support you in this rather than hold you back. My husband encourages me to be more outgoing as any partner should. "
4,b01xst,t2_5td54,LilyOfTheBurbs,"NTA 100% how is she gonna encourage you to open up and be a bit more social then get upset when the you do? its ridiculous. you did nothing wrong. i'm glad you felt comfy enough to talk, sorry you had to deal with her being upset about it. don't let her get you down, you did nothing wrong!"
4,b01xst,t2_sphnnv,dowh4tnow,"NTA - I'm highly introverted too and in that situation would normally not talk much... if they were talking about sports or politics or any other subject I think is BS - I would just sit there, drink my drink, and stare at the wall... but if someone hit on a subject I hold dear - I will absolutely dominate the conversation, because I know all of the facts about that subject and am passionate about either changing someones view, or making sure they got their facts straight."
4,b01xst,t2_2ldikngi,ArtyMostFoul,"NTA But wanted to point out unless it's been said already in which case, sorry. So many red flags here! This woman may have either subconsciously or knowingly chosen you as a spouse because you're quiet and socially anxious because she expected to constantly overshadow you and from the sounds of it, liked things that way, major abuser move, major red flag. Well done for opening up, I know how hard that is, don't let her hold you back but instead remember how that made you feel, being a proper established part of the conversation, having people be interested in you, hold onto that and roll with it and turn social butterfly like I did."
4,b01xst,t2_1gzr8acd,TXperson,"NTA, if my partner did this great while having anxiety I would be celebrating and excited that they’re doing well. Relationships aren’t competitions with winners and losers and having to live in each other’s shadows. They’re partnerships and your success should’ve been her success too but she got mad and accused you of overshadowing her. It’s not cute and it’s really sad. Be with someone who will be proud that you stepped out of your shell, not someone who is going to push you back in when things don’t go her way"
4,b01xst,t2_zj4m3,A_Redheads_Ramblings,NTA &#x200B; You did nothing wrong. She on the other hand is most definitely in the wrong. &#x200B; Seriously? She asks you to be more social and you comply for her to get in a snit that you were being social and engaging in the conversation. What the hell? It's like she can't bear for it not to be always about her. Which is a serious red flag if you ask me. &#x200B; I'm going to take a stab and ask is she an only child? Or the only girl in the family? Cause it sounds very much the behavior of someone who's always been the only/special one for most of their childhood. And could be hiding other more concerning behavior. &#x200B; I would suggest taking a good long look at her and your relationship to see if there's other issues that could become massive problems down the line. &#x200B; Also good for you for trying to be more open to social experiences. Sounds like you had a nice time before her pouting gave you doubts.
4,b01xst,t2_1w9kwc3z,DeathMyBride,"NTA. That was shitty of her and you didn’t “overshadow” her. If she actually cares about your happiness and growth she should be stoked that you came out of your shell. I’d be petty and group text the friends and her, apologizing profusely for “dominating the conversation as you have since learned it was totally rude of you and you’re still working on being comfortable in social situations. You got excited and overzealous and you hope you haven’t offended them.” Then watch her squirm when they say they were happy to get to know you and that you did nothing wrong. "
4,aayffj,t2_luz12,kellasong,"YTA, because based on what you said, it seems like you judged her based on what her peers who did the same poem did rather than a rubric. She sounds like she still fulfilled the requirements even if you didn’t like her reading as much as the other ones. Furthermore, you are an adult, and telling her to stop complaining is a pretty immature way of handling the situation imo. Why did she immediately learn what the other peoples grades were? Did you announce them/show them to the class? "
4,aayffj,t2_ixcff0b,jackalnapesjudsey,"YTA I think you could have been more sensitive to the fact she was upset about it. Obviously you should change the grade if you stand by it, but it wasn’t helpful to essentially tell her to get over it. There could be several reasons this has upset her, maybe she has super strict parents or feels inferior and is struggling with self confidence. Telling someone to stop complaining doesn’t really add any benefit. It seems like explaining it again and telling her she did great and give her a few pointers would help more. Also, isn’t the correct word, proceeded, and not preceded? "
4,aby8kd,t2_58eiela,does_taxes,"Obvious NTA you aren't obligated to place anyone, much less someone who already made you look bad. If you value the relationship though you'll be straight up with them about why you won't refer them again after what happened last time. If they respect you they will understand where you are coming from professionally."
4,a95aw2,t2_2mpfcq6a,LadyCass79,"YTA It's time to grow up. You're focusing on making excuses and lying to family about a difference in personal values and religious beliefs. An adult gets to make their own decisions about these things and can be candid about it. They have a right to not approve, but not a right to make you or him participate in uncomfortable situations to appease them. By doing this how you did, you set up this situation. You should have a conversation with your parents about your life choice and set boundaries firmly. The fact that you can't just say ""Oh, he changed his mind"" and be confident that they will accept the answer tells me it's more emotionally charged than it should be. "
4,artjjm,t2_f1v6h,Cantacantaloupe,"NTA I can tell that you take pride in your work and you shouldn't have to compromise on that just because he is more experienced.

4,b0kall,t2_i5rrl,lyingtattooist,NTA how old are you two? Leaving a wet towel on the floor is way more of an issue than eating a pancake with his hands. Adults pick up after themselves.

He's acting like a child then getting mad at you when you're merely expecting basic adult behaviours. Did he move from his parents house straight in with you? Regardless, he's a slob and has no basic decency by the sounds of it. There's a lot of time that goes into fixing that, but is the emotional (and physical) labour really worth it? "

I agree with basically everyone in the thread. i'm curious if he had a mom that talked in that manner ""we don't live in a hotel"", ""there are plates and silverware"" and sort of I guess platitudes rather than ""hey, the whole towel on the floor stuff is grossing me out. could you try not to do that, for me?"" Not an excuse for the weird mom reaction either way, was just curious"
4,b0kall,t2_zyu17,Toastwaffler,"NTA, assuming there was syrup or grease something on the pancake, dry pancakes aren’t that messy so I’d give him a bit more wriggle room. Either way its important to talk about these kind of annoyances before they turn into long term resentment, and his response to your concerns seems problematic."
4,b0kall,t2_1sjue2ue,TheLadyDanielle,NTA He's right your aren't his mother but he's forcing you to treat him as such by acting like a child. I'm curious how old you two are and if he still has some growing up to do or if this is now a long ingrained pattern of behavior. I would sit down with him and tell him that it bothers you that he calls you his mother because you are being put in a position to act that way. Set some boundaries or rules for the house and if you can't agree it might be time to not live together anymore.
4,b0kall,t2_303gyila,misanthropichell,"Honestly, if he washed his hands after eating I don't see anything wrong with that. Maybe that's just because spreading nutella on a pancake, rolling it up and eating it with hands is a pretty normal thing here. But I agree about the wet towel part, that's just unnecessary and has nothing to do with preference. So NTA"

If you're taking care of him now - just like his mommy - don't kid yourself into thinking that is going to change anytime soon. Especially when you take his attitude into consideration. He clearly doesn't give a shit about cleanliness or neatness and it's very obvious he was raised with no manners whatsoever. He complained that you are treating him like a five year old?? That's because he is behaving like one!! Contrary to what too many women think, you are not going to change him. So you've got a choice. You can take this as a sign and move on without him. Or you can accept the fact that you *ARE* his mommy (and his personal maid) and will be for the rest of his life."
4,b5lqc1,t2_38thcz5y,dollbeb,"it seems like I'm the minority on this, but YTA. It's not really possible to be friends with both Jon and May. May will see it as a betrayal, and imo, your wife is right to be a bit concerned that you don't see a man cheating on his wife as a big enough deal to cut contact with him. Even if it's not forever, I would step away from the friendship for a while."
4,b5lqc1,t2_1ssiyc84,knharp,"NTA but you keeping a friendship with John will probably put a strain on your relationship with your wife, and probably end any friendship you have with May.

That considered I still think ultimately YTA because why do you care so much what other people do? You're not the line police. They just want to serve as many customers as possible and tapping the next in line on the shoulder so everything is 100% ""fair"" is probably just a waste of time and employee resources as they see it. They just want to serve more people. Also I've spent a fair bit of time in countries where people basically don't queue at all so maybe I'm thick skinned when it comes to this particular issue idk. "

Anyways.... If I’ve been in the back when a new line opens I have no issues walking right up IF I have just a few (literally 1-3 items) and others have cart loads.

I understand why she could be upset (she’s proffering and you’re rejecting) but she needs to respect your views as you should respect hers.

You're not her dad to ""let"" her do things and give her allowance. And when I say that, I'm not accusing you of being controlling: she needs to grow up and change. Or earn her own money if she wants these items so badly.

My husband (SAHD) and I have a similar setup - I work, he's home with the kids, and we each have our own accounts and it works really well. He kind of gets an ""allowance"". He also does some part time work to supplement his account, which she might consider. Anyway, the reason this works for us is I really just let him spend that money on whatever crazy thing he wants and I look the other way entirely, and that's what I'd recommend you do too. So you think $200 leggings are a waste fine, but do you have other hobbies/projects you spend on? I bet you wouldn't like her hyper-analyzing your spending. Or is this money taking away from some greater goal, like paying off debt, that you'd like to get on the same page about?

It's unfortunate that it was your son that wanted to talk to you, but she should've made that clear when you texted her because otherwise there is literally no way you could've known. Her claiming ""something was going on"" is a potential red flag, I'm not gonna pretend I know the history you guys have or how your relationship is right now but potentially it could be worth talking to her about that comment and finding out why she might think that so you can smooth out any misunderstanding, because from the information you've given I can't see you've done anything wrong."

Probably not common for most married men with families but you’re in a transition so....seems totally normal. You have more free time- I don’t doubt you’re a good Dad. So not telling your little guy goodnight once isn’t the end of the world. It’s not like you knew that he wanted to do so and purposely ignored it. If it were an emergency she would have called again and sent text messages..so, it’s ok you didn’t swap over. Next time for the sake of your own guilt- ask her to send a text if your son is specifically asking for you- or you send her one. She’s being nosey. Thought you were talking to a girl- because new relationships usually involve lengthy calls..it’s hard not to be the priority anymore (for her not your kiddo). You didn’t answer and her wheels started spinning. When you confirmed you were talking to a guy she already had her mind made up it wasn’t a guy. Now she needs validation for prying.

This is where being nonconfrontational can hurt yourself and the people around you. It was easy to joke with him about sex knowing he actually wanted to have sex with you, because it made him happy thinking he had a chance so you didn't have to be upfront and possibly be involved in conflict. But now you're in a situation where you weren't interested in a guy but you sent him all the signals that you *are* interested, keeping him on the hook and making it all the worse when you inevitably ghost him.

Terminating a pregnancy affects women and men differently, and neither one can really put themselves in the other person’s shoes here. It’s a highly emotional situation, but still needed to be discussed rationally - which doesn’t appear to have been the case, so I’m not surprised it blew up. While his feelings do matter, he should of been more supportive and (both of you) should have waited for things to cool down before making a final decision on your relationship - you both went through a major trauma, with you having to shoulder the hardest part. Your fluctuating emotional state should have been taken into account. Highly emotional situations are a breeding ground for volatile outcomes, and issuing demands/ultimatums when everyone’s mental state is being severely stressed is never a good idea. Ultimatums should be a last-ditch effort, used only after all other options are exhausted, and have been thought through very carefully. You also have to be prepared for the person to make the less desirable option when given one as well. "

To start with I think it's worth mentioning that unwanted pregnancies generally produce tragic situations, and that it probably wasn't anyone's fault that it blew up. It's basically ending up needing to make decisions the relationship hasn't been aged to withstand as a rare consequence of wanting to have your cake and eat it too (ie: have sex, but not get pregnant.) **I don't think you should hold yourself, or him, at fault for everything blowing up on something like that. It's sorta like if an earthquake hit while you were both building a house.** On the subject of ultimatums: Personally, I interpret ultimatums as someone trying to leverage my desire to maintain the integrity of the relationship for short term gain, generally without appreciation for the long term cost. It's the type of thing that feels dramatic and like standing up for yourself rhetorically but in practice poisons future conflicts, and in essence attempts to yank out from your partner an admission that they care about the relationship more than you care about it, when that calculus, counterintuitively, is not conducive to having relationships people want to preserve. The integrity of the relationship is a large part of what makes conflicts able to be rolled out to a healthy conclusion, and bringing its stability into the conflict can be incestuous. "

However, if I called my father a beta male and said very insensitive stuff about his wife dying at 15... he’d probably commit a felony beating my ass. The important thing is this kid definitely needs help. There is a good chance you read people saying that and think that, I’m some way, makes you a failure as a father. Simply put, it doesn’t. You’re not a professional, no parent is. You can be loving and nurturing and kind all you want but sometimes a therapist is the best thing. This is in no way a negative reflection on you.

4,9ypl3q,t2_pglbz,AMHousewife,"NTA - I have three sons. I have told every one of them that if there are problems, the privacy is limited.

In this case, he's acting like a beast and as a parent that means you have to step in and parent. It looks to this parent that he's angry about his mother's death which is a normal reaction. You throw in all that teenage testosterone and trying to navigate their social world, trying so hard to form some kind of identity, and you've got your son who is reactionary about girls and women, placing men on some kind of hierarchy. So while destroying the computer may also have been grief on your part, you better believe my kid would have no to very limited access to the internet had I found what you found. Hell, right now my youngest son is grounded off of computer because he can't seem to do his homework with the lure of Fortnite. Apologize for your emotional reaction and show him vulnerability. DO NOT apologize for removing his access to that material and that avenue for him to act out. It's absolutely unacceptable. He's going to be very angry with you....so?

There is no shame in protecting their self-worth, self-respect, your families emotional well-being and the obvious boundaries in any family relationship not to mention the need to discover when a child is headed down a dark path or is showing hidden mental instability....nobody else will do it for you...and obviously you have discovered your child cannot be trusted to hold steady. It happens all the time. In my household we have an open electronics policy. That is the true test of trust. There is nothing I don't know about my entire families social media, and the same goes for me. It's the only way to be. If your loved ones won't let you go thru their phone or their computer then they are hiding something from you. Totally unacceptable in today's predatory world where the most egregious of horrors can invade your inner sanctum via the internet, twisting young minds. I have been where you are. My child was selling heroin via his computer and phone to the neighborhood kids. I thought he was just popular. He was 13 years old. I found his stash of money under his bed one day. A shit load of bucks. I knew it wasn't from mowing grass, so I went thru his computer. Figured it out pretty quick. If I didn't put the hammer down, and put it down hard...my son would have ended up living a life of crime, in jail or worse. I didn't smash his electronics, I completely removed all electronics from our home. I was the only person who had a phone. He went back to the stone age. He hated my guts, made our lives miserable for a few years. But with therapy, new friends, lots of extracurricular activities, a tutor, and patience..God the patience...he has become a person to be proud of. And yes, he eventually earned the PRIVILEGED of using a computer and having a phone again. As a father, you must stand your ground. You cannot change his thought process, it is learned from his internet use and the people he associates with. He needs intensive therapy (yes, I would suggest a male), new and a better quality of friends, more involvement from you as a role model...and no access to any electronics without your ass being right next to him.

This does not mean you should give him a pass on this behavior because ultimately he is making his own choices, but it does explain what got him started down this road and it wasn’t any action or inaction on your part.

(Rightfully so, I was getting bullied online) Did I hate it? Of course. I felt like my privacy was invaded but he never did it again or used what he found against me after we resolved the concerns. It actually brought us closer because I didn’t want to give him a reason to snoop around. (Eh sounds bad when i type this?) Your son needs professional help. You definitely need to talk with him and get him into therapy ASAP. His behavior is really scary based on your story. He’s going through a lot and he’s also in that phase where he wants to rebel. Be firm but also don’t be too cold towards him. Show him some love since you are the only parent left (sorry for your lost) I think you acknowledging his behavior as odd and seeking help are the first steps towards him getting better. Definitely get on that therapy asap. "

Don't cede your role of parenting fully while you have your chance to help your child develop into a healthy member of society.

You owe him a huge apology and it will take time for that respect to grow back, but you need to work on it. Id literally sit down and tell him you fucked up. School punishment should have been adequate in my opinion. Theres no point in punishing him twice. During school hours he should be revising or doing work at home but thats it.

You are acting insecure by being scared it is an ex's hoodie - so what? Is your relationship that fragile? She chooses to be with you (unless you continue to be an ass, then she might leave you) 5. You don't like how she looks in it. Wow. You don't get to have a say in what she wears - she's your girlfriend, not your Barbie doll. 6. Your positive suggestions to alter it and offer other hoodies was nice, but that's like replacing your puppy / trimming it's ears for looks and expecting you to be fine with it. Cool move, but a bit ""I know best I'm trying to help you"" instead of ""I'm trying to understand and resonate with you, then later we can think about helping"". 7. Upscale dates dressing I can understand - but you still don't get to say what she wears. You can even compromise and ask her to rather tie it around her waist than wearing it if she wants. Upscale dates are nerve-wrecking as heck and I understand the comfort needed. &#x200B; Honestly, I don't understand the fuss. This shouldn't even be an issue. She might have a real reason for it, like it being her dad's or brother's who passed on and not ready to talk about it. Over time, if your relationship lasts, I would suggest getting to know more about the hoody, and why she is so attached to it. And I don't mean that in a screaming-match way. I mean it in a way that - after you stopped bugging her about it constantly for a while - you ask, something along the lines of ""So, we never got to the story behind the hoody? You really like it, huh? / So, comforting, huh? I can see it makes for a nice blanket... what else do you like about it?"" in a nice, loving, inquisitive, friendly, maybe with a tad of joking tone. It is important to show that you really are fine with her liking it now and came to accept it as part of her - she might actually open up to you then, as she will actually trust you. Then, over time she might even need it less as you become her comfort and happy zone, but that will take time. "

That awful hoodie was something he loved that reminded him of good times. Yes I pretty much guided him into wearing a nice peacoat in cold weather and we've slowly upgraded his wardrobe over 4 years. He doesn't wear the hoodie anymore, really but a lot of her old bs clothes remain (Adidas sliders OMG) and he wears them. But! That's him. That's just what he wears and if it bothers me so much I want to ruin or hide his clothes it might be time to leave the relationship. I sleep with a baby blanket as well. Juvenile and embarrassing and unhealthy but it's an anxiety reliever and it doesn't hurt anyone. Everybody is gonna have something mildly fucked up about them and u can choose to roll with it and hope you can slowly guide them out (two God damn years of that college hoodie and it took a full year just to convince him to buy new Adidas slides because the other ones were falling apart and smelly) of whatever it is, upgrade it (with their support and permission), or just accept and move on.

You don't get to control what she wears, you can politely voice an opinion but even that is a stretch if you do it a lot. Don't sneakily fuck around with peoples ""comfort items"". In quotes, because most people have something illogical, be it an item or routine that brings them comfort or security. if it's something you have to confront because it effects you, you have to do so directly not trick, steal, break, sabotage, hide etc. Having a comfort item to this extent is unusual.

You need to set hard boundaries now and nip this in the bud before it gets out of hand.

They won't let anybody come into your room then, and will be escorted out if they refuse to leave. Harsh, I know. But they're not respecting your wishes. If your mom blows up after that, then just let her be pissed. Nothing gives her the right to basically shove herself into anything important for the both of you. Also, your uncle should not have brought this up to your mom. Maybe he genuinely didn't know that he shouldn't have told her.

Your mom sounds excited for the birth of your child. You don't say if it is her first grandchild. Regardless her behavior was over the top rude.

There are other things to consider I guess, like how much money has he dropped on tickets etc, but that does seem to pail in comparison to the birth of your child. This is a tough one. You may also consider the possibility of you not having the baby during the wedding and having him miss it for nothing, which could cause some resentment down the road. Honestly just an awful situation for everyone. Is there any possibility he could just be gone for like two days? Make as small of a window as possible? Land, go to ceremony, and immediately fly back?

If the couple invites you, it should be because they want you to be a participant in their special day, not as a gift grab. It's a courtesy to give a gift, but even for those applying the logic of guests somehow being obligated to repay the equivalent of their food and entertainment shouldn't apply when you're spending more than your cost of dinner to attend.

What self-respecting dude is going to deliberately annoy and insult his girlfriend when she's offering a night of sex? Not saying you should judge your whole relationship on him having a stupid moment, but you should start paying attention to whether he makes a habit of putting you down for petty reasons.

Apparently your shitty mom, according to her! Get a sitter. Getting one vetted through a friend or some site is worth the extra money, if you lay out guidelines for what your son is able to eat, and they follow it. Look into afterschool programs if you have that option. Your mother is a total fucking narcissist if she thinks she can have control over him like that. I have 2 autistic kids. When they were little, they had issues with food. It wasn't even fucking allergies, yet I took that shit seriously, and made 2 or sometimes 3 separate meals at at time, because I cooked for my then husband also. I didn't bitch about it, it was something I did, because you DON'T FUCK WITH CHILDREN AND FOOD. NEVER APOLOGIZE. Tell your mom that until she apologizes for trying to force son to eat things that make him ill, she can pound sand. No pediatrician or child therapist or specialist would EVER advise feeding children allergens just because they only get 'a LITTLE sick' If she can't even bother to make him a sandwich or a salad at least, she can go fuck off, there are lots of foods that while they don't actually qualify as meals, can keep him filled until you can go get him. She's fucking awful. I bet if you end up in therapy and examine your past with her, it will come up as her being controlling, abusive and sociopathic, and not just 'strict'. Good on you for encouraging your son to enforce his boundaries. Allergies change over time, sometimes at random. I became allergic to shellfish OUT OF NOWHERE. One night I was eating and my fucking throat started closing up, didn't know why, but it was terrifying. There were no shrimp in the food I was eating. Turned out someone simmered shrimp in the pan before switching to the next part of the meal. Can you imagine rushing to meet son in the hospital, because his allergy flared up worse than before? Nope, NTA."
4,atvjvo,t2_52dh5,ohtheheavywater,NTA. Your mom is insane. It’s bad enough that she tried to feed him something he can’t eat and got mad at him about it. A kid shouldn’t have to defend himself against his grandmother like that. And forcing kids to clean their plates is a great way to give them eating disorders. Now she wants an apology? Just no. That said... you might need to look for a backup babysitter. 
4,atvjvo,t2_2456rp3y,EsthieBestie986,"NTA! Good for you for teaching your son that he has agency because a lot of children are taught that they can't say no to an adult in any circumstance. Because you've got his back on this one, he'll know that in the future that you'll stand up for him when some asshole says ""oh, it's fine you can eat what the other kids are eating,"" and that can help to prevent a more serious reaction down the road. It's not that he just didn't like the food that was served, it could have caused him real discomfort! She's not putting as much weight on that as she should. You're mom is totally the asshole right now. "
4,atvjvo,t2_32wdpwu6,SnapesSocks,"NTA. Your mom is an asshole. She doesn’t get to decide that he has to poison himself and be uncomfortable because it’s more convenient for her. It doesn’t matter if it’s not one of his deadly allergies. Most allergies will escalate in intensity with increased exposure, so the danger is always there. All that aside, you have taught him he is allowed to refuse things he’s allergic to, YOU are his mom and he’s doing exactly what he’s been taught by you. You’re doing a great job backing him up and honestly, I’d put my mom in a timeout over this, and I’d find an alternative care situation for kiddo. It’s your mom who owes you and your son an apology.

4,atvjvo,t2_5dhon,poeticdisaster,"NTA - Your mother is a HUGE asshole here. As someone with a ton of allergies, the idea that a family member would willingly put me though that discomfort makes me rage for your kid. Good on you for teaching him that not only is he allowed to protect himself but he is 100% allowed to say no to an adult if they are doing something that will hurt him. I wish I had that lesson earlier in life. Unsolicited advice: Easiest fix, if you want to continue to have her watch him: provide a meal for him when he visits her. It shows him that he did nothing wrong. However she may take it as a lack of trust so be careful how you offer this. Personal feelings on this: She is a selfish bitch and is saying her need for convenience is more important than making sure he is comfortable and not hurting. Not only as his caregiver but as his friggin grandmother... come on lady. ""fine as long as he has antihistamines if he gets hives."" < - that genuinely made me livid. That's your family, how the fuck are you gonna treat them like that? I'd ask her if she would be pissed if you forced her to eat something that you both knew she was allergic to because ""oh you can just take a pill to ease the discomfort"". I'm pretty sure she would not be on board for that. Sounds like you may have some good stories for /r/raisedbynarcissists "
4,atvjvo,t2_bc5l1,Ekkkoe,"NTA. This whole 'Oh no, a child talks back to me when I'm being a bitch' attitude bothers the fuck out of me. I was once systematically ignored and ridiculed by my best friend one day because he had a friend over whom he considered cooler. During lunch, to get back at him, I recanted a story about him crying because he didn't like strawberries, but though crushes strawberries would taste like jam. When it didn't, he cried. His mother began laying into me, saying it wasn't nice for me to tell that story. It wasn't, but it was desperation, and she could've easily seen that. I told her to talk to the wall, I wasn't going to take her lecture. To this day I feel weirdly guilty, but the fact is, she should've been there to protect me, not stand up for her asshole son the moment he got what he had coming. "
4,atvjvo,t2_376xvame,Canoe-Maker,"NTA I cannot express with words how frustrating your mother is. She endangered the health and well-being of your son and when he rightfully stood up for himself she lost her mind. She is so much in the wrong here, you are not the problem. The only thing I can possibly think of that gives you any fault is that from the brief paragraph you gave us, it sounds like you didn’t inform your mother about the allergy. I have food allergies and intolerances myself, and when something makes me sick I’m not going to eat it, period. Maybe have your son articulate that it was an allergy thing, but only because he’s five and honestly if someone tells you they won’t eat something as an adult or really anyone who is mentally capable of knowing what they can and can’t handle, they should be believed and respected enough not to have ppl try to force feed them. Sorry for the rant, but I wanted to stress that you and your son are not the problem here. The idea that the kid should apologize for looking after his own well-being is ridiculous. "
4,atvjvo,t2_1t0jh1ac,Jorb985,"NTA - You'd think once things were cleared up about WHY your 5 year old refused to eat a food he is allergic to your mother would have softened on her stance with your son refusing to eat but she doubled down instead. Also, let's be honest, a 5 year old needs hard and fast rules about food allergies. There shouldn't be any gray areas. I know you said you and he decided that he wouldn't eat that food *together* but really you are the mom, you're in charge. It's your rule he is following at your guidance (and you're 100% right no adult can make him eat something hes allergic to, especially without mom present). He did exactly what he should do. Also, if she knows which foods hes allergic to, why would she serve him a food which youd need to take antihistamines with in the first place? Pick something else for fucks sake. If your mom has anything to gripe about, it would be that this rule wasnt made clear to her prior to this (you dont say if it was or wasn't but it doesn't sound like it). That's not your son's fault. If you decide to try to smooth it over just tell her you're sorry you and her weren't clear on this rule beforehand but he will not be apologizing for refusing to eat something he is allergic to. It's his health at stake. If she insists on an apology he can apologize for *how* he said it - his *tone*"
4,atvjvo,t2_x6cdp1k,SquirrelGirlVA,"NTA, neither you nor your child. See, the thing about allergies is that they can change. For example, I'm HIGHLY allergic to dairy, but my reaction more resembles someone with dairy intolerance. I've been warned by multiple physicians and nurses that my reactions can change over time, especially as a body's biology changes over time. (IE, puberty, pregnancy, surgeries, etc) That means that at some point in the future my allergic reaction could change from intestinal issues to hives and anaphylactic shock. I've had anaphylactic reactions show up as a reaction to some of my other allergies and it's not fun. Shooting yourself up with an Epi-Pen is painful, scary, and you will shake for hours afterwards while your body processes the adrenaline. Still, it's better than, y'know, not breathing. This is no different for your child and I'd honestly say that if he's *ALREADY* experiencing hives and an itchy mouth that he's far more at danger of having anaphylactic shock start appearing as an allergic reaction. I'm sorry, but your mother is a complete and total stupid fucking idiot for playing around with your son's allergies like this and getting upset that he won't put himself in harm's way because she wants to do the whole ""clean plate club"" thing. She could be awesome otherwise, but for this she deserves to have someone smack the back of her head. Seriously, I can't stress enough that seemingly benign allergies can turn life threatening and that they should not be taken lightly by anyone, especially a family member. "
4,atvjvo,t2_2sv5vr25,_JustSayin,"NTA You decide what's best for your son, if anything she should apologise for trying to force your son to eat something that could give him hives! P.S. When I was getting tested for allergies (because of a rash I once got from eating sushi) my doctor was pretty serious when he said not to ever eat that kind of sushi again because certain allergies can go from just causing a mild rash to giving you a blocked windpipe very quickly. "
4,atvjvo,t2_8y7dmvg,Muninwing,"NTA. This is exactly what I was saying in another post. Authoritarian bullshit had its place to get kids through the Great Depression alive, was used as a shortcut after that, and has no place in functional families today. We know more about allergies, change in palate, nutrition, even genetics to make this kind of bullshit acceptable anymore. Cilantro tastes like soap to you? That’s actually genetic, not a kid who is a “fussy eater” or is “just looking for attention” or any of the other bullshit excuses. And it’s really easy to just cook around them. Because kids still need proper nutrition. No longer in the “don’t eat what few veggies we can find or afford and you’ll get a deficiency disease” way that the World War Era grew up with and scared their kids with, though. Allergies are no joke. And eating things you hate doesn’t make you a better person. "
4,atvjvo,t2_2vsqmcmz,MissPlumador,Nta kid needs to learn he can say no to foods. Sounds really unconfortablecto me. Your mom sounds similar to pet people who think those with pet allergies can just take a pill and be fine. Who wants to be around something that makes them feel like they have a cold?? 
4,atvjvo,t2_2frr9t5o,depestoreddit,"NTA. Whoa! Does she also make him shake the snotty hand of a person who has a cold because, yah no, there are cold remedies? Kids with food allergies, especially away just age 5, can't always distinguish between, this is what kills me and this is what just sucks. Also, they tend to be naturally more afraid of food, because you should be afraid of things that try to kill you too! It's a good survival instinct for them. Assuming he's generally a polite kid relative to his age, then no. Sounds like an appropriate reaction to me. The only thing is I generally don't advocate ""breaking up"" with family members unless it's severely justified. Only you can be the judge of that, so it would be helpful to figure out how the two of you can get past this. "
4,atvjvo,t2_257eypcu,ilyriaa,"NTA! Omg. My mother would never see my kid again for purposely trying to expose him. Allergic reactions can worsen after exposure, and just because his reactions have been “minor,” doesn’t mean it won’t suddenly be serious next time. And good for your son for standing up for his safety! That must have been very difficult to do, especially to someone who should have his best interests in mind. "
4,atvjvo,t2_uk4b5,angelnursery,"NTA. My parents always considered my slight allergy to kiwis (a fruit that I used to love to eat as a child but now cannot eat without getting an itchy throat and small hive) ridiculous, but they still warn me about dishes with kiwis in them.

4,atvjvo,t2_6x0ja,MissSwat,"NtA and good on your son for standing his ground at such a young age. Kudos to you as well for teaching him to defend his position.

Many kids dont understand their allergies that well and its good that your son is able to look out for himself.

Thats simply absurd
4,atvjvo,t2_ub2zo,miladyelle,"NTA, and your mom is a stone cold bitch more concerned with having her perceived power and authority validated than a child being safe and ALIVE.

4,atvjvo,t2_2wcg1ez1,team_sita,"Nta: your mom has severe control issues with children, and sees you as one too, I happen to think that is kind of horrible. No offense meant and my own experience with those feelings, it was figured out in therapy that it wasn't appropriate behavior on the parents' end. I mean, this imo isn't an issue about him not respecting her. It's an issue of her controlling you both, and him to the point of eating things that make him feel uncomfortable. Wtf is wrong with him eating a sandwich or something? I applaud your outlook and how you are parenting your son with respect and empathy. Smh I really can't wrap my head around people who treat children and their adult children in that way. You can't even be yourself as you say. My therapist recommended ""walking on eggshells.""

If I go to a friend's house or whatever, I don't eat food with wheat in it. I cannot be the AH for choosing to not make myself uncomfortable for the sake of other people's comfort. The only difference here is that he's a kid, and your mom apparently thinks that gives her the right to control his body in this way. Kudos to you for supporting your child in having agency over his own body. As others have said, unbelievable that your mother would punish him for not eating food which can cause him any form of discomfort. "
4,atvjvo,t2_2h0qbpky,ArmaBobalot,"NTA my mother did a similar thing to my daughter when she was 10 months old. She had her over and despite its sending her with food to eat feed her food she was mildly allergic to didn't even check the ingredients, didn't say to us either so the next day when I can't figure out why she's so upset and notice the food is still in her changing bag. That was the last time she got to have her granddaughter over unsupervised."
4,atvjvo,t2_dsh0e9v,Floweringpooops,NTA and why the fuck if your mother so determined to poison your son. The only thing this experience shows is that she is not to be tfauetd with your child alone ever! do you know how many children have died because of adult ignorance and spite? If you enable this or allow your mother around your child I guarantee he will end up in the hospital and you will regret it
4,atvjvo,t2_22l25z2m,kleeinny,"You and your son are NTA. Your mom? Totally TA. I have a shellfish allergy that only presents itself in hives, and the degree of the reaction is varied, and sometimes doesn’t present itself at all if the shellfish is fresh (If you ever have questions about the quality of shellfish at your local eatery, I’m a great barometer. :p). I make the choice to eat it or not, and sometimes if shrimp smells a little too shrimpy, I pass. This is my own choice because I don’t want to have hives if I can avoid it. It is ridiculous that your mom tried to force this issue. That is not okay. The only (not acceptable but maybe understandable) reason for your mom’s behavior is that she forgot he was allergic to this, and then was embarrassed and made it a manners thing, even though she was clearly in the wrong."
4,atvjvo,t2_xw5ny,fuzzyoctopus97,"NTA. Why should anyone have to apologize for refusing to eat something that will leave them uncomfortable or in pain? I think your son needs a new sitter, considering you now know that not only can you can’t trust her to not feed your kid poison, but she will punish him for being brave enough to protect himself, and then demand an apology for it later. You should be proud of that boy for standing up for himself, and make sure that he knows that his grandmother was completely in the wrong for trying to feed him what he shouldn’t eat and punishing him, I know it’s difficult for some kids to do that and it’s good that he did."
4,atvjvo,t2_27r2ssi5,Boredread,"NTA. He’s allergic and said no. It’s good you raised your kid to be aware of his allergies and say no to food.

4,atvjvo,t2_25absm1e,boudicas_shield,"NTA. As an ADULT, if I choose to eat a dish with some of my stronger intolerances in it, and take that risk of a bad gut later, that’s my choice. However, no one can or will ever force me into it if I don’t want it. Your son is a vulnerable young child. You’re absolutely right to back him up on this. And you’re absolutely right to be teaching him right now to avoid all allergens. As I’m sure you know, repeated exposure can turn a mild allergy into a severe one. Your son should never be pressured into eating food he’s allergic to, or punished for not eating it. Your mom sounds like a real piece of work. Sounds like you’ve taught your son well, having him defend himself like that. I would’ve folded like a wet blanket at his age. Keep on being the great mom you are, OP. "
4,atvjvo,t2_hm4jd1q,Plzspeaksoftly,NTA eating food that you are mildly allergic to can cause your body to react in different ways such as a brain tumor. My friend is mildly allergic to chocolate and he breaks out in hives. But he loves chocolate so he kept eating it and took and antihistamines. He developed a brain tumor because of it. Your mom's an ass. I would have a talk with her about feeding him foods that he is allergic to even mildly. 
4,atvjvo,t2_rsoto,eatthebunnytoo,NTA for your original question. Please never leave your kid alone with a person who will medically abuse him and then emotionally abuse him for not apologizing. Chronic allergic inflammation can increase risks of colon cancer BTW. Your mother is not safe or trustworthy and her inability to immediately beg forgiveness for her bullshit is a huge red flag.
4,atvjvo,t2_2zmxdhw,notreallylucy,"NTA. your mom needs to get more educated about allergies. They can escalate over time. Allergies that ""just"" cause hives where the patient keeps getting exposed can progress to anaphylaxis. Your son had 100% the right response to stand up for himself, and you were right not to make him apologize. If possible, you should make an appointment with an allergist and bring your mom along so she can hear from the doctor how she's making your kid sicker. "
4,atvjvo,t2_dkkce,poltyy,"NTA I know you love your mother, but I think you need to call her on her bluff. Reinforce with your son that he is not to ingest allergens and that grandma is wrong. I don’t want to fear monger, but there are TONS of stories on r/justnomil where the mother or MIL just could never admit fault and always had to be right to the point where they’ve hospitalized (and in one case killed a kid) because they could not accept the allergies. I guarantee that the next time kid is there she tries to force him to eat the same meal in a power play. Please cross post over there, because I think this is above AITA’s paygrade."
4,atvjvo,t2_39pqu1aj,Elysium03086,NTA It's way past time we teach our kids that it's absolutely their right to say no even to adults. Kudos to you for teaching him that lesson and the backup to confidently do so.
4,atvjvo,t2_14c7i4,Asmodean129,"NTA. If your mother is anything like my mother (older generation, bit naive to things, etc) then it is likely she doesn't understand allergies properly. If he has eaten the food in the past with you, why can't he eat the food for her? That's what she would be thinking. And as a parent of an allergy prone kid, you should probably avoid that food altogether in case his allergy gets worse. Out of interest, have you taken him to an allergy specialist? Might be discomfort and hives today, but there is no need to make it an EpiPen incident tomorrow"
4,atvjvo,t2_350vqyp3,ClaraElizabethCohen,"NTA. A mild reaction can easily become an anaphylactic reaction. Avoiding allergens all together is the smart way to go about it. Your mother is a total asshole for putting something she KNOWS her grandchild is allergic to in food for them. It's double the asshole level for trying to force him to eat it when he was refusing for his own health. His body, his choice."
4,atvjvo,t2_2wj6ad2v,JWJulie,"NTA - though I would use the opportunity to talk to your son about how he needs to speak to adults, because in future (at school, etc) he needs to be able to get people on his side rather than giving attitude. For religious reasons we don’t take part in various activities and my daughter from a young age has had to be able to explain herself to adults at school. If he comes across as being belligerent he will only make things harder for himself as he is less likely to be believed. Then have a chat with your mum and tell her that you have written a helpful list to aid her memory on which foods you don’t want your son having so that this incident never, ever, happens again. "
4,atvjvo,t2_mnexo,jokerkat,"NTAs - Shame on your mother! He shouldn't have to go through extreme discomfort because she is too lazy to cook a meal free of his allergens for him. This is a hill to die on. She doesn't get to make him poison himself just because she is the adult. There can be permanent damage and escalation of the allergy when repeatedly exposed to minor allergens. Tell her that, and that she apologizes for trying to force him to eat what is literal poison to him and risk making his allergy much worse, or she'll see neither of you again until she does. You are better off without her if she can't follow your parenting rules about your son. She's treading in JustNo territory. Head on over to r/JUSTNOMIL and r/JUSTNOFAMILY to see how to set boundaries and enforce them with consequences. I'd also maybe check out r/raisedbynarcissists to see if she is part of that territory and how to handle it. Many narcs get called ""strict"", when really they are being narcy. It'll help you determine what was actually strict and what was her being controlling, manipulative, and was due to her need to always be right. "
4,atvjvo,t2_4jpid,MsKim,"NTA Your mom is an idiot and I wouldnt let her watch her grandson anymore. You never want to give a kid a food he is ""a little allergic to"" without supervision by a doctor (sometimes doctors will try treatments that include giving the allergic person a little of something they are allergic to but in this scenario the doctor has PALS training and epi on hand) because he can go from hives and a small rash to his throat closing up and dying pretty quickly. Good on your kid for not letting someone try to poison him."
4,atvjvo,t2_1gj1dsw9,SeaOkra,"NTA I have a quite mild allergy to onions, cooked ones or food cooked with them will leave my skin super itchy, but its no huge deal. (well, mostly. scratching myself bloody isn't nice, but if I have a tylenol and an antihistamine, I can endure mild exposures.) On the other hand, last time I bit into raw onion (I didn't know it was in my food) I had a pretty scary reaction to it. Gasping for air, drinking a bottle of liquid benadryl while being rushed to the hospital, it was scary. And scarier still was the time before that I got raw onion in my system? I itched a bit and got a headache. Not sure what flipped, but raw onion is now treated much more carefully around me. My grandmother (who loves onions) won't even cut them if I'm in her house and has eliminated them from recipes for my safety, and she is not an indulgent person, she's one of the strict ""do as I say!"" types. Thing is, a mild allergy at any time could get worse, and if I understand correctly, children with allergies are even more likely to have a sudden change in their reactions. How would grandma feel if her insistence on making him eat his allergen was ""the one"" to push him over into a serious allergy? I think your mom needs to think that over pretty carefully. I'm an adult, I choose to be a bit lackluster with my allergies. Your kiddo is a kid and deserves the people in his circle's protection against danger, whether it seems ""mild"" or not. I have to say, if I were his mom I'd be pretty proud he held firm and didn't take the risk. And anyway, what sort of ass backwards logic is it to intentionally make a kid itch and suffer because you don't want to omit an ingredient or make something else?"
4,atvjvo,t2_2b3c42ct,goldenbellaboo,"NTA at all! I didn’t develop allergies until my early teens, but my brother has had nut allergies pretty much his whole life. As a kid he would refuse food even with the nuts he wasn’t allergic to and nobody would ever give him a problem. They SUCK, even the allergies that just do give you discomfort. Good for you for teaching your son about his allergies. He should ALWAYS put his health over manners. "
4,atvjvo,t2_dqfvxm7,Kazubla,"NTA WTF?! She knowingly gives him food that he's going to have an allergic reaction to.

WTF is wrong with a grandmother who thinks no lethal harm is ok to inflict on her grandchild for absolutely no good reason ! Grandma needs to learn her place! She does not dictate the terms by which OP’s son will be raised. This is a power play and needs to be rebuffed 100%. Perhaps OP needs to pack meals from now on "

4,atvjvo,t2_1rhjn2rk,wickerocker,"NTA, neither is your son. This may be hard but it is probably time for more limited contact between your son and his grandma (of course I’m sure you will talk to him about this to see how he feels). Your mom violated two rules: first by feeding him a known allergen, second by refusing to listen to your son when he expressed that he did not want to eat food he is allergic to (and who the hell *would* want to do that, if it causes hives?!). You had already set these boundaries, I presume, so it is time for consequences. Your son is an amazing guy for standing up to her, and you have done a great job teaching him to use his voice."

And not to eat something no matter what if it has her allergens in it. She asked about getting into trouble at school and at grandmas. I told her I dont care what school or grandma has to say about it. If it is on the cant eat list I have your back. Dont eat it. If someone wants to complain about it to me they can, but you know what you can and can not have. I would demand grandma apologize for trying to force her to eat something she knows she can not without being sick. She how she likes it. "
4,atvjvo,t2_2yukukbe,fluffymom23,"NTA Your mom is the asshole for preparing a meal she knows your child can’t eat.

I will literally vomit for days if I eat pork and I can’t go anywhere bc I can vomit at any time w/o warning. I live w my mom and daughter and we’ve all just basically stopped eating at my sisters house bc of this, but she will occasionally prepare something and bring it to our house w/o me knowing it just on the off chance that I will eat some of it. Don’t let your horrid mother poison your child and then try to make you feel bad about it. It’s borderline child abuse!"
4,atvjvo,t2_5hpacgv,AMultitudeofPandas,"Did you know that allergic reactions can change over time? Even if it doesn't kill him now, it may in the future. You are both entirely correct to avoid it, and given that your mother is so content to force him to eat something she *knows* will cause him pain/discomfort (hives are a bitch), just because ""she knows best, it won't kill him"" tells me she probably shouldn't be babysitting anyways. NTA unless you continue to let her treat your child this way."
4,atvjvo,t2_5cwmo,TexasTeacher,NTA and your Mom should never be with your child unsupervised again. Your son deserves praise for doing the right thing. No one should be forced to eat food that causes them pain! This food can't kill your child - NOW he already has an epipen which means he is more likely to develop a potentially deadly reaction to something else. School house Rocks simplified lesson. Your immune system looks for attackers. When it finds one it defeats it with specialized cells. Then those cells are added to the standing defense rapid response system. This is how vaccines work. When you are allergic to something - your body misidentifies something harmless as dangerous. The cells that attack it have the wrong blue prints and flood your system with histamines. The misprogrammed cells are added to the rapid response system. Every time you are exposed it adds more of the misprogrammed cells to the system. At some point especially with food you can reach the tipping point and the amount of histamine released hits the anaphylactic shock level. &#x200B; I have anaphylactic reaction to peanuts and hive and itching to shell fish. The peanut reaction causes LESS pain - if I get medical care it is over in 72 hours. The shell fish reaction sets of a chain reaction and I can have a rash/itching for 6 months. When I say itching I'm talking fire ants crawling under my skin and biting 24 hours a day 7 days a week for MONTHS!!!! She knowingly tried to cause your son this level of pain she doesn't get to unsupervised time with any child after that in my book. &#x200B; &#x200B;
4,atvjvo,t2_382p0zll,witchyypixiee,"Definitely NTA mama bear. You're raising an awesome kid who stands by his decisions and isnt pushed over by authority to give up him convictions. Good on you! I agree with most on here. Just explain to her that it is his body, and if he does not want to eat something that would make him uncomfortable he has that right. Put it to her this way: Mosquito bites arent life threatening. But if someone asked you to to outside and get something not very important, when you know good and well youre going to get bit up by mosquitos, why would you? Regardless, youre the parent. Your mom has the right to state her opinion but not override that. Also, how would she felt if HER mother tried to put the foot down on you, her child? She would of not enjoyed that much because nobody likes someone parenting their kid. "
4,atvjvo,t2_eeupc,ProNerdPanda,"Unpopular opinion time: YTA but to your kid, not your mom. The kid is right about not wanting to eat specific things for specific reasons, but there are ways to communicate, stuff like “you can’t make me” doesn’t really come off as gentle. While I realize a five-year old kid doesn’t know how to handle conflict, you’re his mother and are doing him a disservice by not teaching him how to handle saying No, you could’ve told him to excuse himself for the way he said it, but also speak truthfully about the fact that what he did wasn’t wrong. By saying “I can’t make him apologize and I support that 100%” you probably have him permission to be rude to your mother for other reasons; kids don’t understand context very well, he probably will respond bad to your mom again in the future and have this moment as reference when you tell him “well that’s different” That’s my opinion anyway ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Edit: lots of downvotes, I don’t care about muh internet points but have the guts to say why you disagree. "
4,atvjvo,t2_1143he,KrytenLister,"YTA and are being a masssssive drama queen. Your mother isn’t trying to poison him on purpose, so clearly isn’t aware of the issue. If your son is grown up enough to”decide together” that he’s not going to eat something because he’s allergic, then he should be articulate enough to explain that he’s allergic (or how does he understand enough to make the decision). Without that explanation, intended or no, his behaviour comes across as rude. You’re projecting and this whole thing is cringe. "
4,atvjvo,t2_2krlgsu2,Ebox3rchamp,"ESH old school people don’t understand what the big deal about food allergies are. They grew up in a time when that wasn’t known about or didn’t occur. Your mom needs to get with the times. You should however cut her some slack. Trying to take care of children with allergies as you know is very difficult especially in today’s times of multiple ingredients and hidden ingredients. She is doing you a solid in babysitting your child. She is helping you and you might not be paying her or paying her what you would have to someone else. I would apologize but not for “not eating the food”. I as the adult would apologize for the difficulty it is to deal with that at meal time, and what your mom considers the lost of money in the food presented. Another reason your mom May have been upset is..now the other children may say “I don’t want that, I’m not eating that” suddenly she’s got kids that won’t eat their dinner or lunch. Multiple kids can be difficult to please. Which while not your fault or technically your problem, u could still be sympathetic to understanding the situation she was presented with. She has to maintain some order or the kids would over run her. She is the AH for not accepting your sons condition as causing him discomfort that she seems to consider trivial. That isn’t fair. To make a child who is allergic to milk or whatever consume it to feel bloated and sick for the rest of the evening is not being empathetic to his comfort. Ask her if someone refused to give her Tylenol when she presented with a headache how would she feel about that person. Yeah it’s not deadly or a serious issue but still very uncomfortable. "
4,b5x6fk,t2_33zuoq2q,Dtazlyon,"NAH From what you’ve said, you help out lots around the house already, which is fantastic. I saw somewhere in another comment that you should see if you can negotiate down to once per month for babysitting, which I think is perfectly reasonable and a great suggestion. Hiring a sitter for two overnight shifts once per month isn’t an outlandish thing to ask your mom to do."
4,b21clr,t2_2tm2gxjx,Ann-von-Beaverhausen,"NTA. So, just to put this out there, if she’s like this before kids, after kids you will basically never have sex again. She’s being a jerk - dismissive of your needs, refusing to look into a medical reason for her lack of libido and condescending and dismissive of your perfectly reasonable and desirable wish to have sex with your wife. You may be fine with almost no sex - many people are. However, if you’re not, I think your marriage is doomed to fail unless your wife changes her tune. Sorry man, that sucks. "
4,b21clr,t2_jxst0yn,dapper_rabbit,"NAH. Sounds like you both have quite different sex drives. You’re not in the wrong for wanting more, and she’s not in the wrong for being comfortable with the current arrangement. Unfortunately, this might mean you two have a compatibility issue more than anything else. You ideally want a partner who matches your sex drive, but of course, tricky thing is sex drives can change throughout the lifespan. So even if you were good ages ago, that can change and it’s not really anyone’s fault. And it seems rough to break up over something like that. So from here, it’s all about communication and managing expectations. Maybe you can both look at broadening your definition of what sex is. A lot of people fall into the trap of viewing 99% of sex acts as “foreplay”, with the end game always being penetrative vaginal sex. This can get unappealing for some women over time, even if your vaginal sex is great. Basically, when sex can be small spontaneous acts rather than a whole standard event, she might warm up to it more often. Just a suggestion. Best of luck OP! I hope things turn around for both of you. :)"
4,b21clr,t2_37kbl2td,mcthrowaway_anon,"NTA. She was super mean to you, not cool.

Physical affection and touch are things I crave to feel love and it's no wonder to me that once these stopped I didn't feel like I was cared for anymore. So at the very least. I understand. I would tell her how you feel again. TMI: after a year of ending things with my last gf he told me how he had E.D. from scar tissue in his urethra from a traumatic event from when he was a kid. So there might be a serious underlying reason. I would talk to her and tell her it's not just sex to you. It obviously isn't just some teenage thing to get your rocks off.

4,ax7h5u,t2_2hya7tnb,AMerryBerry,"ESH I honestly dislike anyone who does ""breaks"" without having a clear and established outline of what that means. Are you temporarily broken up? If so you wouldn't be TA because you're not together. Are you just getting physical space and limiting contact for a bit? If so you would be TA because that's not even close to a breakup. Most likely, and what seems to be the pattern with ""breaks"", is that you wanted an excuse to hurt the other person without going through the effort of risking your emotional support/sex. Your bf is also an a-hole here for not calling you out on that bull. "
4,ax7h5u,t2_momvlrz,imatuesdayperson,"I'm leaning more toward YTA here. The cuddling isn't the problem- cuddling can be between friends, family, etc. To say that you should only cuddle with your boyfriend would be ridiculous. However, purposely starting a fight and using the money he gave you for emergencies to go to a hotel rubs me the wrong way. You and your boyfriend could both do a better job at communicating with one another. If things aren't working out, you could also find another partner without nearly as much on his plate. Also, age gaps (which aren't necessarily bad when it's between two consenting adults) can make a couple feel disconnected because of their different life goals and level of experience. A 40-something year old (especially one with multiple kids) has a different lifestyle than a 20-something year old. "

Some couples really don’t get each other, so that question is really just random commentary where I can imagine a “no asshole” perspective (not having been there myself). Moving forward, maybe you should quit worrying about being controlling and just be direct since it’s possible the lack of that had in some possible way that he felt validated in doing what he did(?). Or just realize that you have poor communication in your relationship but you already reproduced with him and leave him because he is insistent on maintaining that relationship that you view as toxic (and for good reason).

That is how family is supposed to work. It’s not about them owing you it’s about being able to trust that your family cares enough about you to help you out when you need it. There are way too many unbelievably selfish people out there who have tons of money that will let their children and grandchildren suffer when they could totally make their lives easier.

Maybe this is my mistake. OP is TA if he distances himself in the manner of ""I can't believe you're doing this to me, I thought we were friends"". Next step would be that he announces his distancing himself to anyone willing to listen and makes surrounding friends and friendgroups feel like they need to take a side. This happens way to often, especially since there's just a lot of people out there who will blindly take sides in issues where a friend gets with an ex of another friend. If OP were to pull off one of these then IMO that would make him TA. But as I've started off with originally: If OP just distances himself for the sake of being less in touch with a topic that makes him feel bad then that's completely okay and it would be a NAH situation. &#x200B; EDIT 2: I added a ""tendency to YTA"" after my initial NAH claim, being concerned that down the road OP might affect friends in a negative way.

Much later when I really started to realize how that would of affected him I just felt ashamed that the thought even crossed my mind. It’s just a shitty feeling. I’m married now but here’s how I look at it. My friend could have dated the woman of my dreams and it wouldn’t matter. There without a doubt is (and was) someone out there, within reach, that was better for me. Mathematically, it’s just impossible for that not to be the case. It really just comes down down to if someone is strong enough to pass a date up for a friendship. Perhaps the only exception is a distant friend you don’t really talk to anymore?

4,afvqlc,t2_2jeyivxa,cactuslass,"Let me tell you a story...... My friend was dating this guy 7-8 years ago and he became part of our friend group. He was a great guy and we all loved him. He and I developed an amazing friendship and had a ton of things in common. About a year later my friend tanked her relationship with this guy, by being controlling, cheating on him, and lying. None of us took sides, we all continued to be friends with both of them. Several months after they broke up, he continued to hang out with me alone and with groups of friends (nothing happened). Finally, one day he asked me out. We went out in a date and I liked him but my younger self was like I can't date my friends ex, that's wrong. I told him I just couldn't date him right now and we continued to be friends. We both moved out of state. My girl friend found the guy of her dreams finally and is married with two kids. 2 years ago, the guy and I got back in touch with each other wondering why we ever stopped talking. We started seeing each other long distance and he eventually found a great job and moved to my town. We now are in a 2 year relationship and it's the healthiest most functional one of our lives. All I can think is how stupid I feel and how much time I wasted not being with him all these years. If I hadn't turned him down because of a stupid friend rule maybe we would have been together the last 8 years. Sometimes things don't make sense until time has passed. This sounds like the girl you dated was not the person for you or it wouldn't have ended. Your friend waited more than a year to date this girl. I think that's plenty of time. What if she's his person and yours is still out there waiting to be found? All I'm saying is don't deny your friend a chance at happiness because you can't let go of the past. He did right by communicating it to you and if you need to distance yourself that's your right. I wouldn't completely wrote him off though. Maybe talk to him and communicate your feelings.

It doesn't mean that you have to resume being his friend like nothing happened in the future, just that you're continuing to work on yourself. It sounds like you're working on this based on your post, so I think that you should just continue to do you. Your friend was aware of your feelings for her and as such, should understand why you're stepping back. If he doesn't understand why you aren't continuing on the way you were, then he's definitely the asshole in this scenario.

If it makes you feel any better, one of my friends started dating my ex about a year after we amicably broke up.

He is also emotionally and verbally abusive to my mom, like he was to me (except he was also physically abusive to me) when we were living together, so my mom said that's enough so if he keeps doing this shit he's out in an instant with no more money from my mother. He's 20, and at this point my mother has done all she can for him, while he just does nothing and isn't planning on doing anything while being incredibly abusive. I love my brother a lot, even if he was very abusive to me and is abusive to my mom, I don't want him to die. At this point though my mom can't afford to live with him, and she can't mentally cope with his shit anymore. He has been to many psychiatrists and counsellors, but the issue is is that he isn't willing to change himself. Now there's nothing to be done except tell him if he doesn't change he's gone.

Your mom might be a giant bitch, but it still doesn't excuse your father for abandoning his kids and not paying child support. He had a responsibility to you that he totally blew off.

That way it doesn’t come off as you being rude for not sharing (I have seen far too many posts where the aunts/uncles automatically think their kid can do whatever they want in another persons home). My point is be civil and bring this up to his parents and have an adult talk with them while calmly stating your reasons and ask if they can get their kid to stop asking about it because the answer will continue to be ‘no’. If that doesn’t work or the kid keeps asking anyway (especially since they are sleeping in the same room with it and kids can be sneaky) you can always disconnect it and store it somewhere else until they leave."

Best thing I could suggest is having a sit down with her, explain that you understand that she’s upset with the way you acted, however the fact that you had these plans to spend one on one time together and she invited her friends made you feel like crap when you already get so little time with her. Maybe suggest she comes to visit you instead next time so there’s no chance for her to change any plans that you make.

My own personal experience sort of relates. My parents are married but my dad had to make a major sacrifice one year. My dad had to work in St. Louis for 7 months while we lived around Hinsdale, IL. Every weekend, like clockwork he would drive back home and drive back to work for the week. Occasionally he would get to fly like if there was an important event (birthday, sports, etc) but driving is cheaper. My sister and I were in high school though and we told him it's okay if he misses a weekend or two because it's far! But that's because we were older and understood. Why did he have to do this? His job moved there and I just had open heart surgery. He needed the money and insurance for me. So while he looked for a job near home, he still had to work so we would be okay. "

That doesn’t negate HER responsibility to meet you halfway, especially since she’s the one who moved. It’s not just your responsibility to make sure you get to see your son. She should be putting in an equal effort to make sure that he gets to see you too! Putting the burden of transportation solely on you because of her work schedule is a crap move. Frankly, this problem is one that results from her decisions and not yours. I’d understand if this was a once in a while thing for her but you haven’t mentioned her making any effort to resolve what looks to be a long-term issue. Imagine if she had come on here and said, “I moved further away from my son’s father to be with my husband. I’m in the process of getting divorced and my soon to be ex-husband won’t meet my son’s father halfway for drop offs anymore. Will I be the asshole if I expect my son’s father to drive an extra 100 miles every weekend so that he can see him? I can’t meet him halfway because I have work.” She’d get a hell of a lot of YTA responses, I think. It would probably be best for your son if you continued getting him every weekend but it doesn’t make you the asshole for recognizing that it’s difficult and unfair. It doesn’t make you the asshole because you now have to reconsider how things could pan out if she doesn’t step up. It will cost you more money and time. That’s the practical result and that affects you and the rest of your family. Maybe instead of splitting the distance equally each way, you could discuss with your ex each of you driving the full distance one way? You pick up on Friday and she comes to get him on Sunday or vice versa. That means she only has to rearrange her work schedule on one day of the week. You could even tell her it doesn’t matter when each person does the drive, just whichever works best for her. You’ll do the full drive on whichever day she truly can’t. "

This is also how a lot of people actually make their living, finding valuable antiques at goodwills and estate sales. They’re just like anyone else with a unique skill set, their eye for antiques and the time they put in looking sales over is how they get paid. Implying there was no skill or time put in on your end is ridiculous. This would maybe be different if he was a nice guy that wanted to give you a good deal or do you a favor. He thought he was ripping you off and did it happily. If the tables were turned, there’s zero chance he’d give the items back. "
4,ba5yf8,t2_xw5ny,fuzzyoctopus97,"NTA, you paid for them fair and square, he’s got no case, basically any lawyer would laugh in his face, it’s now in your possession and he’s got no right to it whatsoever, even if he was a decent person you wouldn’t have to give it back, his personality has nothing to do with his."
4,ba5yf8,t2_2pgr785i,kingramennoodle2,"NTA. if he wanted a fair price he should have done his due diligence, no excuse in the age of the internet to not look up going rates for items. Also if he wanted you to give him a heads up about stuff like that he should have been a nicer neighbor."

Kept calling saying ""this is Red Cross and blue shield offering the best insurance"" from several different numbers from different area codes. They do not respect their fake ""add to do not call option."" They call multiple times when I'm busy in my day. To hell with these scammers!

4,b1fh05,t2_wxk7fgz,vberger19,"NTA - If you two end up getting married, all that debt is now your debt too. The conversations will only get worse and rougher down the line a few years into marriage. You're trying to nip it in the bud right now, and there's no shame in that. My first marriage was a non stop stress and fights over my ex's spending habits and the debt load we incurred. I applaud you for trying to get ahead of this as it will only get worse."
4,b1fh05,t2_1l7d9fl9,DNAmber,"NTA - Debt is like a crippling disease and it needs to be acknowledged properly and dealt with. She's allowing it to fester because she's being enabled to, but you can tell it's affecting her mental health already. I don't know where you are, but in the UK we have charities geared towards helping people manage their debt and find solutions that she can cope with. That money isn't going to pay itself back, and unfortunately you're part of this mess for being in a relationship with her - so she does have to do something very soon as it'll only get worse."
4,b1fh05,t2_2465wd75,uberchelle_CA,"NTA. You’re just more responsible than she is. That said, her inability to address problems head-on and work proactively on them is a red flag. You’ve only been together 8 months. If you marry this woman, you may find issues like this to be problematic. You have a greater degree of success for a long term marriage if you choose someone who has a financial outlook closer to yours. On the other hand, if there are a bunch of other qualities about this woman that negate her bad ones, you can always do what one person I know did. He proposed to his gf, but refused to set a date until she had paid off her debt (about $50k in credit, college was paid for in full by her parents). He told her it was a dealbreaker, because if she couldn’t manage her finances by herself or ask him to help her manage it he couldn’t see a long term future with her because of the differences in how they perceived money. She hunkered down, began booking work for every weekend (instead of ones she just felt like working) and paid her debt off in less than a year."
4,b1fh05,t2_38n499o1,Super_Personality,"NTA - How is she struggling to pass her boards??? Is she not studying properly for it? My class got a 100% pass rate on the first try and there were multiple people there who struggled throughout the year to maintain the minimum C. I'm a bit concerned with her lack of pro activeness and this is just going to be a long time issue unless she changes, or you learn to live with it. But just from my SO's experience, his ex couldn't be motivated to do ANYTHING for herself, even after 10+ years, and still to this day. I think it's more time to consider whether this is a fight you want to keep fighting, or just move on to someone who meets your standards. "

This guy is the type to skate by, until his position on the team is threatened. I frequently was paired with an all male group in projects, and they were the-slackers. I made sure they didn’t get credit for shit they refused to work on. I’m assuming it was part male entitled (I was the only female) or general stupidity."
4,aolx0v,t2_2y9zbg8l,aberdeennova,"NTA- you seem like a very understanding friend, and that's hard to find. I don't blame you for not wanting to invite him to your home if he's going to do that sort of behaviour. This also doesn't make you an asshole, rather someone who's tired of having to clean up some nasty stuff after your friend. Hanging out at his house, or somewhere public (since you mentioned he's better behaved around people not friends of his) may work best. "
4,aolx0v,t2_8pyxt,archaeopteryx79,"NTA - I've been in that situation and it's tough to hang out with someone you want to be friends with, but who has awful social skills. One of the friends I had was texting me 50 times a day or more, emailing me, and plastering my FB with likes on all of my pictures and inappropriate videos that he would share on my wall. I asked him not to do this and he didn't stop and claimed he couldn't help it. I eventually had to end the friendship over it. I agree that you don't want to have your friend feel left out, but you also don't need to have someone around who is disregarding your belongings like this. Maybe you can ask him to go out for coffee instead of hanging out at your place, where he won't damage your things but you can still visit with him. "
4,apfrva,t2_31ofpgvg,ActivityBook,"NTA > my boyfriend had said he would be inside once they left “in a bit” so we could shower together (honestly my favorite part of the day which he knows). Once he noticed he was going to take longer that ""a bit"" he should have let you know. He had already made plans with you. Is it possible that he was trying to avoid confrontation? How would you have reacted if he had told you ""I'll hang out with my friends until 3:30am"" ?"
4,apfrva,t2_12othv,AlphaBreak,"> And he immediately gets defensive saying I “know how he is with time” This translates to ""I will never improve in any area I am deficient in.

4,apfrva,t2_70tpu,Ultra_Leopard,"NTA. But if he really does suck this much at time management and the time does get away from him, he will never text you to say he'll be later. I would just assume when he has his friends over he's not going to be in for the shower etc. So just do your own thing then you won't be so irritated with him and clock watching causing more irritation (rightly so by the way). "
4,apfrva,t2_2xm7aac7,ccfj2018,"NTA. He sounds selfish and unwilling to compromise or be understanding. That whole thing where he made you ""look up"" what that phrase meant shows he's clinging at straws to prove his point. He knows he's wrong. He knows he's inconsiderate. He just wants you to cater to him and be quiet when you are upset by his actions. I don't think he is going to get better. No one is bad at time management. I'm sure if it were something he considered important he would be on time / show up "
4,apfrva,t2_30tliya4,liiiibra,"Yeah, NTA. I was on the fence until i saw you say that you don’t live with him. You’re literally a guest in his place and he’s ditching you like that? I don’t care how long you two have been dating, he should be showing you the same respect that he shows his friends who are guests. Respect and time management can go hand in hand - he’s 26 and still has issues with it? Yikes. "
4,apfrva,t2_2miw1q1o,Smitty_S39,"NTA, he seems a bit inconsiderate... however, and somewhat unrelated, the whole shower thing just seems weird. I get that showering together is fun, I enjoy showering with my wife. That being said, we mostly shower alone and certainly don't pout about the fact that one showered without the other. Just strikes me as odd, that's all... especially for your ages. "
4,apfrva,t2_64eorbn,cawatxcamt,"YTA. Your bf was hanging out in his shop, at his home, with his buddies, on a weekend, and you’re mad he didn’t kick them out so you could...shower? Girl, you were tired and you went to bed. You weren’t denied a friggin shower, you chose to act like a child who’s not capable of functioning on her own. Grow up. Stop trying to control someone who isn’t doing anything wrong or he’s not gonna be your man much longer. "

4,aeaa1b,t2_d08st,cicc0s,"NTA, and I'll share you a story....just 'cause. My Nan was about 93, never got sick and was always healthy. She was getting pretty frail at that age (duh) and we insisted she should start using a walking stick. She didn't want to because she said it made her look (or feel, not sure) old. Even though she never left her house and lived alone. She was ADAMANT she didn't need one. So what happened? Within the year, she fell down and broke her hip, it got infected and she died. All because she was too stubborn/proud to listen to the advice given to her by family and medical professionals. So, in summary; make sure your Grandma takes what's been prescribed to her. Better to be safe than sorry."
4,b13q2u,t2_gra4002,gibby10toes,"NTA I think you offered a very mature and productive solution. Your ex makes a good point about it being hard to move on with you still in her life, but she doesn't get to decide who her sister is friends with. So your solution is a great compromise. If she's not willing to compromise, then just forget her."
4,b9yvvi,t2_2jp217kh,imaketreepuns,"It depends on what you city are in. Personally, I think NTA but I admit I am going against the grain a bit. In a city with a lot pedestrians and a lot people who regularly commute by foot, you are probably fine. It's incredibly rude to leave your car any where you can obstruct the flow of traffic and really potentially putting a lot of people's lives at risk (since they have to cross in the street in front of or behind your car). In a city where cars are little more valued people seem to get irrationally offended by you touching their car. As if birds don't shit on it and homeless people don't pee on it when they aren't looking. I have nearly been hit plenty by cars that pull into the crosswalk while I am using it and getting angry about nearly getting run over seems legit to me. However, it's important to remember you are not the police and these matters can be better handled by someone who can issue legal monetary consequences with video evidence."
4,b94vdb,t2_3mqrw,Boysenberry,"YTA. It's fine to have specific requirements for who you'll date, you can cut down your own dating pool in any way you like (for instance I don't date people with different political beliefs) but you need to have that conversation BEFORE you start a relationship with someone, not months into the relationship. If you know you can't be with someone who doesn't have a thriving career and a lot of financial ambition, that's like a ""within three dates"" conversation to have. Also, your post does come off like you think you're better than everyone, which is pretty normal for being 22 but will eventually get in your way if you want to have a long-term intimate relationship. You don't need to panic about it right now, some of that will automatically change as you mature and have more life experiences, but you might want to start thinking about working through some of the reasons you feel like that in preparation for the stage of your life where a superiority complex will no longer be cute and will start getting you fired/dumped."
4,b94vdb,t2_j3j4l,MRmandato,"YTA. You are in your early fucking 20s. Basically still children and working things out. If you were 35 it would be a different story but tons of people use their twenties in normal jobs while they figure out what they want to do instead of getting into debt with tons of degrees but no idea. It insane that you would right off someone so young just for what they currently are doing or their current plans. People change and people are more than their job. People also sometimes dont have the money to go to school or the connections to make 75,000 right out of college. That coupled with you bragging about your expected income makes you sound immature and a bit insecure. "
4,asudh6,t2_e2rl1d,jgslcut,"YTA - Reminds me of a time I was playing blackjack in Vegas about 20 years ago. An Australian kid (in his 20's) was playing with us. Every time a good looking girl would walk past he would get up and go ask for their number. This happened several times, and every time he would do it he would hold up our game play. As he came back to the table after one of these episodes, he looked at us with a big grin on his face and said ""those who hesitate go home and masturbate!"" I was jealous of his confidence. You should just take it as a compliment."
4,almfgo,t2_e9i7k,PartTimeMisanthrope,"NTA: You certainly could have been more tactful--a ""Sorry man, I'm just trying to focus on my workout here"" would have been a better start, followed by your more blunt response if he persisted, but you're perfectly within your right to correct rule-breaking behavior at the gym especially if it's interfering with your workout. "
4,almfgo,t2_8rrjj,Xannin,"Rule number 1 is re rack your weights, but yeah you shouldn't have to talk to everyone and their mother. Your handling of it was slightly assish, but overall NTA for not wanting to be ridiculed while working out."
4,almfgo,t2_xl87w,justtosubscribe,NTA. I was prepared to defend the dude if he was just a lonely old man trying to be friendly with “crazy weather we are having” types of comments. But he was being an asshole.
4,almfgo,t2_cpdq0,nostromo909,NTA. That wasn’t a conversation it was criticism and you had every right to shut it down. The only people at a gym that ever talked to me were the Downs people or otherwise mentally challenged and I “noped” the frick out as fast as possible which probably make ME the asshole...
4,almfgo,t2_ic31mho,Clown3aby,"NTA. When I'm at the gym, I'm there to work out, not talk. I have a limited amount of time to work out in the morning before work so my gym time is precious. For some people, the gym is just another social club and they couldn't care less about actually doing anything but talk. I always wear my headphones as the universal ""fuck off"" symbol but even that doesn't stop people sometimes. These are the same asshats that curl in the squat rack, or take up a bench for over an hour because they just lean on it and talk to people and maybe do a set here or there and then not even re-rack the weights they ""used"". Shit bothers me to no end. Sorry for ranting. You're definitely NTA though."
4,almfgo,t2_adjgq,russharv9,"NTA. It's hard to be sure of how big an asshole this guy was because I don't know the tone with which he was speaking (to me, it sounded like he was trying to motivate/encourage you a little bit because that's how my friends and I motivate each other; ""Come on, man, you got this! What are you doing quitting? You've got one more rep to go!"") Regardless of how he was going about it, it wasn't his place. You could have been a little bit less of a dick about it and that *might* be something you could apologize for (your call, not even a suggestion from me because you might not ever see him again), but you're not an asshole for not wanting to be spoken to."
4,almfgo,t2_2ib590kw,AVerySnaileySnail,"NTA The first examples of stuff he said to you were super condescending. Also, yeah it's weird, intrusive and uncomfortable for him to just be like getting all up in your business. Stranger danger. Like good on you for standing up for yourself &#x200B; Also, DON'T think you should have been nicer in telling this guy off. People take advantage of that, and what you did at least will be a surefire way of making sure he doesn't interrupt your workouts again. Besides, the dude probably won't even care after a few days maximum"
4,9v8uty,t2_3w3z812,Originalwookie, NTA depending on how it’s pronounced it will be pretty easy for his dickhead classmates to tease him and naming him “cat” isn’t gonna do him any favors either. Remember children are monsters when adults aren’t looking I’d recommend something more traditional.
4,9v8uty,t2_1rlqmeir,a1337sti,"NTA, that is a stupid name. &#x200B; but how you word it may affect how he takes it. maybe a white lie "" you know i was hesitant at first but it started to grow on me so i told some co-workers but everyone is telling me its not a good name and our son will get picked on, so really i think we should keep brain storming"" ?? "
4,ay29oa,t2_6qnyb,Murdiff,"ETA there are some serious red flags here. If you’re going to get married you’re going to be sharing space and that currently sounds like a problem. Not only because you want your own space but because she is very messy and you are not, how will you handle that when you live together? Getting married is about building a life together not if something is or is not your responsibility. You should want to help her out and at the same time she should realize the effort you are putting in and not take advantage of it. It sounds like a long engagement might be a good idea, the pressure of the ‘foreverness’ of marriage will probably make these issues worse. "
4,ay29oa,t2_awff2,CatherineConstance,"YTA/ESH - why are you guys even together?! You live together but you don't want to share a room with her. You only have one car but don't consider it a shared vehicle and you don't care about her well being or her education. If you don't want her to be your problem (which you clearly don't considering you're annoyed with having to drive her to school and you don't want your FIANCEE in ""your room"" because you need space ???) then that is your right, but don't call her your fiancee if you don't want to act like people who are about to get married. You don't get to have your own room in most marriages, and you need to be there for each other and be partners and help each other out. Y'all really don't seem like you should be getting married, to each other or anyone else any time soon."
4,a341w7,t2_2kvbpz7t,Sybellie,Nta. I grew up in home with cats that had free range and always hated that they would sleep on my pillow and I would breath in their hair. When I got my own place and got a cat I trained him to never set foot on my pillow. And he doesn't. He also doesn't sleep with us long so doesn't disturb our sleep. Like most people here have said a dog bed next to your bed or at the foot is a good compromise imo. And maybe have a blanket you cover your bed with when u are not sleeping so if the dogs r on it during the day it can be removed at night. 
4,ba2tgk,t2_20ujfgcr,itsstilltoospicy,Does Walmart actually ask everyone to see their receipts? I’ve never been but that does sound inconvenient if you’ve just come from the cashier. Nevertheless YTA she’s trying to earn a living and has to do what she is told. Chances are she thinks it’s just as ridiculous as you do. Complain to the store or management next time instead. 
4,ba2tgk,t2_j9afo,Salt-Pile,"YTA, she didn't make up the policy - she was just doing her (low paid) job - if you don't like it, the people you should take it up with are the management of your Walmart. Which you haven't done. You sound like you were also needlessly rude. >I just want to come in a buy my things and leave in peace, I'm not stealing anything.

He knew the spots were on a first-come, first-served basis as he'd done the trip before, and you went out of your way to remind him several times to send in his deposit. If it had been me, and despite all of the reminders you gave him, I *probably* would have reached out to him when the other organizer said he potentially had a 16th to tell Trevor ""hey, the trip is literally about to fill up and if you don't send in your deposit RIGHT NOW you're not going to get to come along"" to give him the opportunity. But I don't think the fact that you didn't do this makes you an asshole. This is on Trevor, it's his fault for not following through despite numerous reminders."
4,b0p1xw,t2_tqnjz,vinoestveritas,"NTA. You 1) made it clear from the beginning it is first-come-first-served, which seems like it includes the payment of the deposit and 2) gave him at least 3-4 reminders that he replied to, (which means it wasn't like he didn't see it)."
4,adr3ge,t2_2osjz7z6,SharpShel,"NTA. I want so badly to err on the side of this just being a huge miscommunication of sorts. But damn. Your sister knows that momentarily your boyfriend is coming to let her in. When she sees a young man approaching her/the door, why wouldn’t she logically figure that’s probably who it was? Rather than reaching for the mace, why not say “Hey, are you (OP’s) boyfriend?” She went from zero to batshit crazy really quick, and her stupid racial profile text to you kind of shows where her head was at. Then to top it off, she doesn’t even apologize? She sounds awful. "
4,adr3ge,t2_111o2n,IncredibleGonzo,"Has she never seen a picture of your boyfriend? That's a bit weird these days! Anyway, NTA. Wasn't sure until the sister's response after the incident. You wouldn't be the asshole anyway, but while her reaction to your boyfriend was *definitely* assholeish, it's also *sort of* understandable that she'd be scared by a dude she didn't know at night (not saying it's ok to pepper spray unprovoked though). But someone who's generally not an asshole would have been super apologetic as soon as she found out what was going on. When she did the complete opposite is when she went from base level asshole to raging monster loony asshole. Of course she was also being racist before the pepper spray happened, so bonus asshole points there."
4,adr3ge,t2_um9qi,LordGopu,"I know sometimes it's hard to see the truth of situations when you're in them, especially when it involves family or friends. We've all been there I'm sure. In this case though, just read the posts here. Everyone is flipping out because your sister is fucked. You can't assault random people because you ""felt scared"". She certainly seems like a racist asshole, and that's reason enough not to speak to her anymore. Even if her actions weren't racially motivated, she assaulted a stranger for no reason and will not accept responsibility. Another good reason to not associate her. Again I know cutting people out of your life can be difficult, depending on how you were raised (some people are raised with a very ""family before all"" mentality) but at the very least she needs to be cut from your life. Pressing charges is up to you guys, obviously. There is a certain amount of hassle there but she certainly deserves it for attacking someone and being unrepentant. If she did it once why wouldn't she do it again (or hasn't done it already?)?"
4,a8xu19,t2_28lbl40f,Bytien,"NTA but God damn you chose a bad post title. At any given time she is 100% entitled to not have sex. If it's a pattern and you dont feel satisfied long term then you should maybe work on it, explore why she doesnt want to have sex or how to make it a more desirable experience for her. If it simply comes down to libido or something you might just not be compatible. The lingerie thing then going cold is a bit weird and understandably frustrating. We both know she didnt owe you sex but its worth exploring why she didnt want to if she seemed somewhat excited about it earlier."
4,a8xu19,t2_2fqarc7y,livvy_17,"NTA, and in the future I would advise against using sex as a gift or encouraging it as a gift, because it leads to disappointment like this. Obviously this isn’t something that will end a 5 year relationship on its own, but it’s really important to talk to her and see what’s going on. There may be an issue stopping sex that she isn’t talking about right now, and communication is key. "
4,a8xu19,t2_271lh6er,ShreddedDaphy,"Nta for wanting it, and good on you for not pushing it. Could there be a bigger problem behind it? When you ask her about it does she just kind of poopoo the subject or does she wanna discuss it? I’m just wondering cause I know sometimes when things go cold for my husband and I it’s due to stress, or money issues, my mental illness acting up, his work schedule. Any number of things can affect a persons sex drive. "
4,a8xu19,t2_ylop3,Rabb1tH3ad,"NTA She sounds selfish, based off the ""I didn't feel like it"" brush off and how you said she responds to your attempts at having a real discussion about your sex life in some of your comments, OP. If she won't have sex with you and refuses to even have an adult discussion with you about why that is, I'd seriously consider examining this relationship and deciding whether this is something that you are willing to tolerate in the long-term.

Other than that, the other people in the staff lunchroom should not be complaining if they are not part of the convo, they should just be minding their own business. "

Anyway now that my rant it done NTA."
4,b29i7w,t2_ma563bl,bingal33dingal33,"NTA, but there are probably other ways to deal with this to get yourself a better outcome. Complaining to the administration will probably not help you, and if your administrators are incompetent, she might find out it was you who made a complaint. If she's been around as long as you say, she probably has tenure and the administration won't do anything about her. Even if they decided to fire her, there would be a drawn out battle with the teachers' union. It is highly unlikely that you would get a new geometry teacher this year. Personally demonstrate to her that you want to do extra work to learn. Even if it's useless, ask her for extra help. They'll never tell you, but a lot of teachers cut major slack for their favorite students. If other kids are getting results by ignoring her lectures and self-teaching, do that. There are resources online like Khan Academy that have videos and instructions to help you learn math concepts. Early geometry is a lot of memorization, so you might just have to do it yourself. Get your teacher to see that you want to improve and do it."

He probably won't be because of tenure, but you might be able to get a different teacher or get the administration to give him a different job, maybe teaching remedial math or just supervising study hall. And from the little bit you said about him he seems like an asshole. Over half the class is doing poorly and the biggest common factor is that he's the teacher yet he wants to say you guys aren't paying attention and need to do better. That makes him an asshole."

Firstly you need to check with your brother to see if he can afford to feed you both for however long you are going. He's choosing the cheapest option to get his bike over there, does he have the money to host and entertain two people? Secondly, you need to talk to your girlfriend about the first point I made. Then talk to her about the fact, that you are not buying half her ticket. "
4,b42d2o,t2_lummb5j,RainbowYaz,"NTA I can see why she would assume she was going to get to go. When couples lives together for as long as you mentioned in another post, you tend to do almost everything together. You never said she was going though, so she jumped the gun. I'd try to talk to her about it. If possible, maybe offer to pay a portion of her ticket.

He may disregard your tears because they come so easily and frequently, but as your partner he needs to allow you to have feelings (and you need to allow him his). You know already you need to work on crying over things so readily. The bigger issue here is the poor communication about both of your needs. He likely needed space to decompress after his long day before trying to be social or eat. You needed attention and appreciation for the meal you cooked. He needed a feeling of security at home and you needed to feel like he still loves you despite the screwup with the door. This stuff isn't getting communicated in a clear, direct, considerate way.

I do think it might be a little harsh to blame him for your issues with alcohol if he isn’t directly encouraging you to drink, but instead you are drinking because you feel depressed.

You guys are really young, and at that age, a lot of people go through their first real relationships. Oftentimes, people freak out about the smallest things. Recently, I had a friend of mine get her first bf, she has now cut contact with all male friends of hers because she is terrified of harming her new relationship. It's completely irrational, but normal for first relationships, and I think this may be along the lines of what's happening here. As for the bet, I have no idea what's up with that...but it would at least explain the sudden ""you'll need your own ride"" thing.

You definitly couldnt have known if she hadnt mentioned it earlier, nor did you actually praise nazies. Just fyi, when you talk about good stuff the nazies did (that are extremly overshadowed by the evil ofc), just try and do it carefully when talking to someone jewish.

Why would someone trade with their competition when they can receive a satisfactory trade from someone else? If they other player was worse of than you in the game trading with them is inherently better than trading with you. So, makes sense why they didn't offer you a trade but accepted the same trade from someone else.

It takes up a lot more of my time and effort than just leaving out or replacing an ingredient because someone is trying to avoid/doesn’t like a certain type of food. But just asking about the ingredients of something is fine. Even if you said you’re intolerant (which is technically true if you can’t tolerate almonds) I’d have no problem with that because that doesn’t necessitate all the extra cleaning and separating."

His wife is a piece of shit, but my oldest brother puts on the face of all good and loving. He just let's his wife do all of his dirty work. He has never apologized to me for his heinous acts.

That sucks. Life's hard enough without having his tape still spinning in your head. (Sorry for the analog reference. Don't know today's equivalent.) I'm glad you're doing well health-wise for *you*, not your OB. And it's great that he has a decent wife who may help him to become a decent father. However, the ball's 100% in your OB's court to approach you and/or your twin brother regarding amends or reconciliation at this point. I know it's awkward as f\*ck at family events. So what?

I have a brother as well and he often pulls the ""well you said you would earlier so you can't back down on it,"" standard sibling stuff. That being said, he was still a total a hole for leaving you, his brother, in the cold with no ride home because he wanted to watch a game. Like that's some really dumb reasoning on his part.

The courts do *not* always favor the woman; it’s more difficult if you’re not married (is your name on the birth certificate?) and the child is really young.

That's a profound lack of empathy right there. You're annoyed with her because she wanted a shot at putting her personality before her disability in your eyes? Like can you not even fathom why she would want to do that? Or do you know why, you just find it offensive? I agree with the others saying you could also have handled the rejection better as well, but I do also understand the point of being blunt and honest as I have several people I'm very close to who are like this."
4,aw7rpq,t2_1n7g6pln,DubiousDutchy,"YTA, not because a wheelchair is an obstacle you can't overcome, but because you lack empathy in expressing yourself. Be blunt with your close friends, be sensitive with those that do not know you so well. I'm Dutch and even Dutch people think I am blunt in private, which is saying something. I tend to think of it as not selling bs, but being clear, concise and truthful. Still, you could have figured out that it wouldn't work from the start and still treat her well and get to know her, you only saw the wheelchair, not an actual person, so... YTA, don't treat people like dick recepticles even if you are a dick yourself. "
4,aw7rpq,t2_nwgcx,somesnazzyname,NTA- you should have been told before the date. They kept this from you and that wasn't fair and being pushed into that situation at 22 I'd probably not have the social skills to handle this any better than you.

It is very shitty to blind date someone with a clear and serious physical issue and not tell the other person. That is a real asshole move. This situation was forced on you and from what I saw you handled it respectfully and weren't mean about it. I cant believe how many assholes here expect you to lie to the girl or otherwise hide why you dont want to date her. The wheelchair bound are people too. They both deserve and can handle the truth.

Ultimately not going further is the right thing for both, you don’t owe her a relationship and you are in your right of choosing who you date, and this “fell in love of my personality” is just an optimistic fantasy, it’s a mix of everything, physical appearance, sex life, family life, everything needs to be in harmony for a relationship to work out, “my personality” can only take you so far before getting worn out because of the incompatibility on other fields, which will lead to a break up. And she deserves someone that it’s willing to commit to her condition, someone that is willing to take care of her in her moments of need because of love, the best way to find that is by being upfront about who she is, there will be rejections of course, but that happens to everybody, handicapped or not, lying about who we are only lead to failed relationships"

That wouldn't have been a lie, it would have been telling the truth tactfully and with maturity and kindness. Instead you insulted her, told her you wouldn't have accepted the date if you knew she was handicapped, and got annoyed at her. I mean, you were so mean you made her cry. I've known a few people born with various handicaps. They're usually bullied so much throughout their lives that it takes *a lot* to even phase them, let alone make them cry. YTA, big time."

What if you had 3 kids from a previous marriage and didn't think to mention it in a text? *Guaranteed* she would have flipped out at you keeping that info hidden. She could have loved hearing about your kids, but you would have had an obligation to tell her about them beforehand, not just dropped it like a bombshell during the first date because you were ""nervous for her reaction"". However YTA for lack of tact. What you said was mean. You didn't have to say that, specifically. "
4,aw7rpq,t2_39pqu1aj,Elysium03086,NTA You were put in a pretty awkward position. People may not agree with your wording but that's neither here nor there. You have the right to refuse dating anyone for any reason. I personally feel that you are not even obligated to give a reason. What would definitely make you the asshole is leading her on knowing that you weren't interested. Rejection stings no matter what; but it's way worse when you have been led to believe this person liked you. 
4,aw7rpq,t2_2z3ys9bj,octopuds-roverlord,"YTA theres a difference between being honest and being cruel. She was afraid you would only see her as disabled if you didn't get a chance to talk first.

So you felt the need to basically say ""Date over not happening"" it doesnt matter that you liked her and she was easy to talk to.... Maybe you're an ableist. But the middle of a date is not the best time to grind an axe. You should have finished the date and afterwards transitioned to a strictly platonic relationship. You basically told her ""Had a nice time but I dont do wheelchairs so bye."" "
4,aw7rpq,t2_rk0yo,falls_asleep_reading,"ESH Sara and your friend lied to you about something pretty damned important. Being disabled--whether paraplegic or another type of disability--is fundamental to your personality and who you are as a person. I'm not in a wheelchair but I am disabled and so much of who I am has changed drastically as a result of my disability (and honestly, in my case, I'm a better person than I was before I became disabled)... She's been disabled since birth, so she's well aware that her disability not only affects her, but those around her. To start a relationship on a foundation of dishonesty is just... not a great way to begin. Both Sara and your mutual friend handled themselves badly here. You also handled yourself badly. Being lied to sucks, but telling a disabled person that who they are as a person is irrelevant--to you, they are only their disability is just a total dick move. You liked Sara enough to go out with her after getting to know her. You saw the wheelchair, got annoyed, and basically said, ""you're disabled, so this won't work."" A cursory mention of the lie of omission, but not that being lied to bothered you--Sara being in a wheelchair was what bothered you. Yeah, everyone in the situation is an asshole, including you."
4,aw7rpq,t2_coehw,badboybenny_gc,"NTA - &#x200B; They obviously felt that you wouldn't accept the date if you knew upfront about the handicap.

"
4,aw7rpq,t2_nijl9,ShomerNegia,"NTA. Had to read the story twice though. At first, like everyone else saying YTA/ESH, your method of being blunt was a bit off-putting. But seeing as Sara and the friend seemed to be deliberately going out of the way to hide that from you, either as an 'experiment' or to make a point of some sort - don't really feel sorry for her. Also, to everyone admonishing OP's bluntness and lack of tact - it seems like you're interpreting it as him saying ""you're handicapped, not gonna work, peace"". Well first of all I should point out that he did spend an hour there so he didn't just 'walk out'. But also, his blunt behavior was in *direct* response to her statement about trying to hide it. So I wouldn't only say it's hard to feel sorry for her, I'd almost say it was in place and justified. He was probably waiting for a more 'tactful' opportunity to leave, but after she said that he said fuck it."
4,aw7rpq,t2_6rp99,thechrissie,"NTA What a shitty position to be in. Either you lie (and leave her questioning why you didn't want to date), or you tell the truth (which makes her feel bad anyway). You were put in that position by this girl and your friend and had no way of coming out ahead. They set you up to fail. Also, I have a lot of sympathy for this girl, but when it comes to paraplegia, partners are signing up for a whole lot more than just ""they can't walk good."" There's a whole host of conditions of dating a paraplegic. And honestly, shame on her for trying to guilt trip you into something you weren't prepared for. It's uncool. Could you have been nicer? Sure. But you know who else could have been less shitty? Your friend and Sarah. NTA due to forces beyond your control. "
4,aw7rpq,t2_wqyn0,cernegiant,"YTA. She's in a wheelchair that doesn't necessarily mean you still can't do like 95% of what most dating couples do.

You have to assess your own needs and capacities, balance them against the other person's, and determine how much you're capable of giving. She's definitely in the wrong for not mentioning it to you beforehand, but I can understand why someone would want to get to know-how before revealing something like that. What I'd have done in her position is gotten to know you, secured the date, THEN told you, so it wouldn't be a surprise. YTA basically because of how you handled it. I would have at least finished the date. You took off, mid-date, having told someone that you wouldn't be with them because of the wheelchair. Tact is a thing, and I'd recommend you learn some. If you hadn't bolted, then she'd be the asshole. "

This was shitty on behalf of the date. You were put in a tough situation, and yes I’m sure it hurt her quite a bit and sure you could have done it more delicately and in a better fashion, but “I know you wouldn’t like me but maybe if I hide something and put you on the spot you’ll like me and won’t even notice this huge aspect of me that would affect your lifestyle” not cool. It’s a really sucky situation for her, and it really stinks that she’s in a situation that puts her at an extreme disadvantage with dating, but it’s something she needs to be upfront about."
4,aw7rpq,t2_15rpzo,MortalForce,"NTA. Hear me out. If you get blindsided like that with a lie that, you're not going to be well equipped/prepared to reject this woman politely. Sure, it COULD have been handled better, but I doubt I (or many others) would have done better. I more likely would just go with it, but then get chewed out for leading her on when I did drop the charade. There's no right answer here."
4,aw7rpq,t2_59xwe,MicroDigitalAwaker,"NTA, they knew what they were doing, neither of them gave you a heads up at all besides you dont get to know someone by being surprised by a disability you have to have honest open communication and OP got none of that. Its like if OP set his friend up with a dude from my 600 pound life but got upset when it didnt go well and said ""but he's really bice with a lot of the same interests!"" Not the asshole OP, you were just as blunt as either of the gals should have been. If your friend brings it up again suggest a nice brisk hike for your second date."

4,aw7rpq,t2_137ibi,FamousTG,"YTA - And here's why; Not because you did not want to date her, that's perfectly acceptable and you're entirely in your right. You even have reason to be upset because of the fact she left out really important details to her situation. However - Man, there's just times in life where you're going to have to keep certain opinions/comments/feelings to yourself. This girl has obviously had it rough in the dating department, she's undoubtedly self conscious about her situation and you're the perfect example as to why. Everyone wants to feel wanted and loved, her disability has probably hindered her when it comes to dating the entirety of her life. That's obviously not your problem but there's no reason to add fuel to the fire, how would you feel in her position? Be a gentleman, respect her feelings as a human, suck it up for an hour or two and enjoy the conversation. After the date part ways, text her later advising you didn't feel a connection but wish her the best, at least have some fucking tact. That's it man, there's no need to be so straight forward and rude, no need to make her feel even worse than she clearly already did about her situation. You were definitely the asshole and I hope you learn a valuable lesson from this."
4,aw7rpq,t2_powswyc,ouelletouellet,It's one thing if your just not into a relationship happens all the time but YTA why the hell difference does it make if someone is disabled or in a wheelchair why can't you look past that? Are you that superficial? Like when your getting to know someone it should be about who they really are not because their in a wheel chair I think you have very flawed views and expectations when to comes to relationships and people in general Also you could of been nicer to her too 
4,aw7rpq,t2_hcokh,limpingpigeon,"YTA because ending a first date with an outright rejection _in public_ is almost always a jerk move. Even if the person is not very invested, rejection never feels good and it can feel embarrassing if it's done in public. If a first date is a dud, but you don't want to be a jerk, you say something like ""it was nice to meet you, but I have to get going"". Then later you text and say you don't think this will work out but wish them well in the future so they can be sad about it without an audience. You got annoyed and you were blunt about ending the date. That's your right, but sometimes being bluntly honest still makes you the asshole. And while I agree that actively concealing something that will be obvious upon meeting isn't a good strategy, it's a _first_ date. First dates are low-stakes, low-commitment, and almost always a wild card. I feel like it's probably unrealistic to have much expectation of people disclosing potential dealbreakers before meeting for coffee. Most people aren't going to offer up a list of reasons not to date them."
4,aw7rpq,t2_3fhf0vba,Pavsters,"YTA To everyone saying she had to have mentioned beforehand: should she have mentioned if she were fat? Too short? Too tall? Had a health condition? All these things are deal breakers for some people, but not everyone is comfortable disclosing up front. Grow up. If it's a deal breaker for you just don't go on a second date, you weren't set up for a date with a serial killer."
4,aw7rpq,t2_2lljj33b,Luckythepunk,YTA in a major way. Put yourself in her shoes. It has to be difficult to date people in that situation (granted you should’ve been told of her condition beforehand) so you go out and have what seems like a decent date with someone and then are told I don’t want to date over something you can’t control. It’s going to make it more difficult after that. Not to mention you can’t remember shit about the date itself so it seems like you didn’t care to begin with anyways. You can’t hide behind well I was honest thing all the time. Sometimes ignorance is bliss and she would have had more confidence after had you not pulled that BS. Also as a side note you sound like a stereotypical nice guy. “Well I did buy her coffe and a croissant.” As if she should appreciate a five dollar meal for you acting like a dick. Grow the fuck up and accept your judgement. 
4,aw7rpq,t2_34ev61hz,ForgotMyNane,"YTA for all the reasons others mention but also the fact that you spent an hour with her and don't even remember how she became paralyzed. This isn't a just case of you being TA because you weren't interested and didn't go about it the right way, you didn't even show the courtesy of paying attention to what she was telling you. I just hope she doesn't take this too hard and give up on looking. "
4,aw7rpq,t2_2ul7ro3l,Atux67,"YTA for the way you handled it. You should have just been nice about it and not seen her again, say something like I just didn’t feel a connection. This is one of those cases where in my opinion a lie is better than the truth. IMTA for when I went on a tinder girl and when she arrived her photos were about 5 years out of date. Basically she was very plus sized. In my defence I don’t mind a girl being a little chubby but I’m really not ok with obese and the more she talked about her life style of heavy drinking, take always and fast food with no intention of changing as if she was proud I just sat there thinking no this isn’t going to work. I value my health and have lost over 100lbs I’m not going to go back to being obese. I’ve seen the damage it does to relatives with diabetes, gout, growths etc which could be prevented by being a healthy bmi. I was nice about it. We had a friendly date/meeting for a couple of hours. It wasn’t terrible conversation but I felt no attraction to her and I did feel a little tricked in to it. She actually wanted me to come home with her too but I refused - so I turned down an easy lay because I didn’t like the girl. I just ghosted her afterwards - probably not the best way to handle it but it was better than saying “you lied about your pictures and I don’t find you attractive.”"
4,aw7rpq,t2_16fctm,xAlois,"NTA. &#x200B; It's not easy saying this, but I stand behind this judgement. I don't like the way you acted in this situation, and perhaps I wouldn't even personally like you, OP, but, in all fairness, you were thrown in an awkward situation by your friend. You were effectively mislead and lied to up until the date itself happened, and, expectedly, you handled things poorly. You could've had tact, but being tactful is a matter of capability rather than intentions - usually, at least. I feel more sorrow for your date. Yes, she and your friend lied to you, but I doubt you took a moment to think about why she'd need to lie about stuff like this in the first place. It ain't easy, and she's just as much deserving of love as you are. I think you're shallow, but reasonably so. You've a right to your own standards. Maybe give the suffering you've caused to the poor girl some thought."
4,aw7rpq,t2_21l6rw78,Babyhandgrenade,"YTA Dude I'm sorry but I didn't even read your post. I have Muscular Dystrophy and I should be in a chair all the time but I don't want to be. To reject someone on the basis that they are disabled makes you a huge ass hole. It makes you sound shallow. You shouldn't judge someone based on whether or not they were in a wheelchair because you could be missing out on a really good partner. I hate it when people assume that because I'm in a chair that means that I am mentally challenge. Not that there's anything wrong with people who are mentally challenged oh, it's just that I wish people would stop seeing the chair and automatically equating it to mentally challenged. I can hear and understand like anybody else. Actually I'm pretty smart and friendly and funny and my friends tell me that I am a great person to be around. If you're going to be shallow and narrow your dating pool to only people who look normal for lack of a better term than you are seriously missing out. But hey, if you're going to be that shallow then you deserve the shallow people that you're going to get in return. And that's all I have to say about that. Okay I will edit this a little bit and say that she should have been forthcoming with you about the fact that she's in a wheelchair before you met up. Normally I let people get to know me as a person over text before I tell them that I'm disabled. That way they can judge for themselves whether they would like to know me based on what they know about me as a person rather than quickly jumping to the fact that I'm in a wheelchair and letting it turn them off. Regardless of that, you are the asshole for rejecting her simply because she's in a wheelchair."
4,aw7rpq,t2_13dgbf,Sylvi2021,"YTA for how you handled things. I’m disabled. I have an arm that is fully deformed and looks really gross. I know that it’s going to be too much for some people in the dating world. It’s a reality that all disabled people face. I’m ok with that. I can usually tell when someone is just overwhelmed by my condition but I have never in 15 years of dating had someone legitimately get mad I didn’t tell them I was disabled before a date or leave in a huff because of the fact. Yes, it would have been nice for her to tell you. But people really do prejudge those with disabilities. She likely wanted not to focus on her wheelchair. What actually probably happened was your friend thought your personality and the girls would mesh well so she wanted you to not reject her for her wheelchair without giving her a chance - which you did anyway. You’re definitely an asshole. Your post and replies radiate the fact. That girl dodged a bullet by getting rid of you. "
4,aw7rpq,t2_2jexbi8i,Luciferbelle,"YTA... why should her wheelchair matter? You said you liked her, she's pretty, and was nice. I don't get how her being in a wheelchair made the difference. I get you think you should've been told. But, like she said... she wanted you to get to know her first. I bet she's act assholes like you react to her the exact same way you did. Which is why she wanted you to see her personality first. I know plenty of people who married or is in a relationship with someone in a wheelchair. The chair doesn't bother them... why? Because it's not their personality, it's a stupid chair. Grow up dude. "

4,aw7rpq,t2_4xvepgt,YukonCass,"NTA - She chose to drop this on you. Like she went out of the way to make sure you didn't have a heads up and couldn't mentally prepare yourself. And that's not fair. Her being a paraplegic would 100% affect any relationship you might have, and it's up to you whether you want to take that one. Am I saying that she's not worth being in a relationship with or that it wouldn't be fulfilling? No, but she doesn't get to try and trap or trick you into dating her. If she was morbidly obese and sent you pictures from five years ago when she was skinny we would all agree that that was dishonest and unfair, and this is the same thing. Yes some fat people are lovely (I am), but no one is required to date one and we don't get to trick people in to it."

In the moment even a politician would struggle in this predicament. It’s a terrible situation to be put in - either lie or hurt someone’s feelings. And I actually think it’s more respectful to tell the truth, much less condescending than assuming they can’t handle the truth. And when people try to be too delicate often the message loses meaning and clarity. If anybody needed the cold hard truth it was these two girls that came up with this sick plan. He was even generous with his time, staying for an entire hour, having a sincere conversation as two new friends, and then worked up the courage to disqualify her as a lover. Im honestly impressed. I was catfished once and I was more more angry than OP at being lied to. Although I had wasted a lot of time, money and affection before we met in person. "

How you handled it was panic driven and I'm not surprised it blew up in her face. At the end of it the date was ""blind"" though and you should have seen it through "
4,aw7rpq,t2_2pr6cky6,CeleryRoot1983,"ESH, but mostly YTA. Sometimes you need to look beyond they physical and get to know the person. I have a friend in a wheel chair, and she gets dismissed from conversations like a child (people will talk to me while looking away from her). Drives me nuts. She is a freaking great woman, beautiful, but the wheel chair freaks people out. Just like it freaked you out. That being said, obviously you are not the type of person who can handle somebody in a wheel chair, so it's for the best you didn't keep it going just to be nice. She could have avoided this scenario had you been informed ahead of time. Could have been nicer about it though. "
4,9zndzt,t2_2evg93er,InquisitorCelestino,"YTA beyond a doubt. To break it down: 1. You said that he IS attempting to lose wait, but it is slow going because of his schedule among other things. The guy is trying to change, and most likely it's for your sake. You really can't ask for much more than that, it's not easy to lose weight while trying to deal with life. 2. Using his weight as an insult in multiple arguments is a HARD YTA. It's destructive, it REALLY hurts, and you all you are doing is belittling him to no good end. 3. You Think your friends would be ashamed of him? That means you, whether or not you admit it, are ashamed of him to an extent. And that is not justified here. From everything you've said, he seems to be as loyal, devoted, and caring a bf as anyone could ask for. If his weight means more to you and your friends than his actions, then you need to look yourself in the mirror and think about who is the better person in this relationship."
4,9zndzt,t2_16gu49,acrylicvigilante_,"YTA. Although every partner we're with has flaws we might not love, not being able to bring that person around our friends because we're embarrassed is a huge sign they're not for us. Also... > My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained. You say all the things your boyfriend does, but never mention the reasons you like him that aren't tasks to better your life. He's not a tv show, he's not meant to keep you entertained. Why do you love him for *him*? For example, I love my boyfriend because he's witty, genuinely kind to everyone, thoughtful, stubborn, and wakes up every day intending to make that day the best. Too often men are valued only because of what they can do, not what they are, and I think that might be what's happening here."
4,9zndzt,t2_hogj0,pieisnice9,"YTA. So much. Bringing up his weight in unrelated arguments so he backs down and apologises is incredibly manipulative. If one of my friends partners brought up their weight to win an argument, I’d tell them to leave that relationship. It’s so far past the line of what I’d consider acceptable behaviour in an adult. "
4,9zndzt,t2_16pqaq,HostileErectile,"I would feel the same. It's a huge character flaw and a pathetic way to live as overweight. It reflects on you. And people certainly judge you and wonder why exactly you're with a person so much beneath you. They will view you as lower status and quality because why in the world are you in such a situation. Does he have money? Do you have low self respect or low confidence? So yea... You should feel shame because people judge you. He is mentally pathetic as he cant lose weight which of course he can no matter schedule. Losing weight in essence frees up the calendar, now he needs to spend less time eating to much. So again, you're not an asshole for feeling ashamed, you should feel ashamed. He is a giant red flickering light that shows your own character flaws and self hate towards the whole world."

Listen I know people are allergic to talking about their boundaries and levels of comfort with their partners, but I do a thing with my SO that works pretty well: we defined from the beginning situations in which we'd be okay seeing each other engaging with someone else. We're both okay with kissing other people as long as we tell each other but that's it - ergo, we'd know exactly how to proceed in a game like truth or dare. You're not the asshole because you didn't see harm in kissing your friend - you're an asshole because you didn't bother to question your boyfriend's level of comfort with that situation, you simply presumed it would be the same as yours.

As for who should pay or not pay, who should work and who should stay at home with the kids, or who in a relationship should do anything else, that's the business of the couple in the relationship, and not anyone else. I don't think your mother's age is significant here, because even 30 years ago when she was your age, there were stay at home fathers, and dating couples going dutch. "

4,a1v1ph,t2_ojdfd,sarahmgray,"**NTA.** I mean, holy fuck, who does that to kids?! That’d be uncomfortable for many *adult* siblings. Casting *young teenage siblings* as a couple is absolutely inappropriate. Frankly, even if both you and your sister were 100% comfy with it, it is STILL wrong for the director to cast you two as a romantic couple - your being cool with it is not the same as your peers being cool with it. Your peers are teenagers, and teenagers are nasty little shits to each other. The amount of nasty teenage assholery that you and/or your sister will face if you play a romantic couple is likely significant; being okay with the casting is not the same as being okay with that type of social stress. - You can’t know the social fallout of playing these roles or how long it’ll last. - You can’t know how successfully you or your (very young) sister will be able to handle the teasing, insults, and rumors. - You can’t know how it’ll impact your relationship with your sister (but it probably won’t be positive). Deal with public jokes and rumors about incest and being romantically involved with your sibling for a few weeks ... you’ll be *amazed* by how quickly you stop being comfortable acting like normal siblings. You simply should *never* have been put in this position in the first place. One of you should quit. The directors are fucking assholes. "

Maybe your sister, as talented as she is, grows and learns through something else for another year. Don’t let your seeming good nature get in the way of standing up for yourself. You should be a little mad because of this."
4,a1v1ph,t2_175dgg,blitheobjective,"NTA. They are the assholes (those directors and whoever else was involved in casting) for their incompetence. This was absolutely a mistake that no one but you is trying to correct. However, doing anything about it is only going to hurt you (or your sister). Either one of you will change roles or you will quit the play, so you have to weigh what's worse to you- losing the role (and the awards/role to put your resume/etc.) or the situation of having you and your sister playing a couple. If you're already willing to take the role of coach then it sounds like you're already ready to take a worse role to get out of the situation. If you're going into acting as a career though (as it sounds like you are, as it sounds like your family is in the business), think carefully about this since the bigger role on your resume can make a difference to certain casting agents and directors, especially when you're first starting out and don't have much. Little things build onto bigger things. The best solution, since it sounds like nobody was cast based on who would be best for which role since the directors haven't the first clue about HSM, would be for either you or your sister to be switched with another more or less equal role. This would of course inconvenience someone else who already has another role too but this would be the most fair thing all around. That said, it's not in your hands to decide that and if the directors are this inept then they probably won't want to bother. My advice would be for you (or get your father/parents) to go above the heads of the directors if you can and talk to the principal/program director/whoever may be above them and explain the situation including that the directors had no idea really who they were casting for what besides a general ""lead"" or ""supporting"" type of idea. It is inappropriate to cast siblings as love interests in teen productions and the directors didn't even know they were doing it. If you think they may be open to it, you could also try talking to the directors too, you never know. Otherwise it's just taking that smaller coach part as you mentioned, if they let you, or dropping out, or sucking it up and playing the role of Chad with your sister. Finally, in the business you may have to do things you're uncomfortable with, and I'm sure siblings have played love interests in professional settings before (though I try to imagine say Jake and Maggie playing love interests and it's skeevy) and you just deal with it for the sake of your own career. But since this was done unknowingly by the directors out of incompetence, and since you're a teen and not an adult, then personally I think something should be done here to get one of you a different role. &#x200B;"
4,a1v1ph,t2_d1m0ei9,Basketeetch,"NTA. I would be so fucking creeped out. You wouldn't be an asshole for just quitting completely, but don't make an impulsive decision about that just because you're pissed--It was dumb of the directors not to familiarize themselves with the script first, but if they can move you or your sister into a different role, would you still enjoy doing the play? If so, just approach the directors and let them know you'll need to be recast if you're going to remain in the play."
4,aorwnz,t2_rcmj1,Gouranga56,"YTA So talking to you wife about your issues, perfectly fine and given the history you put up, understandable. Try to dictate to her who she can and cannot have in the delivery room when she is giving birth, dick move.

Further, I am now with a guy that my father does not like all that much. It’s uncomfortable when we are all three together. My boyfriend and I have a great relationship. My father and I have a great relationship. The two of them do not. Enough backstory. There is no fricking way I’d insist that my father be at the birth of my boyfriends child. It is essential that the baby’s father have an intimate time with the mother and the newborn. It is not about the mother only; it is about the new family. OPs father in law has been awful to him. OP is not the asshole here. Edit: I posted this before I read all the other responses. I see that NTAs are being downvoted like crazy. Well whatever. Bring it on.

No reason why her parents can't come visit after delivery. But it seems like it should just be future mom and dad in the room. I believe most hospitals have a policy on how many people can be in the delivery room. Lack of space, things can happen quickly or emergencies, etc. Maybe if you explain how important it is to you to be able to share this with your wife, she will understand. If that's what it's about. If it's just because you don't like her father, you are going to have to suck it up. She is choosing what she wants over your feelings. I don't think that she gets to be the sole person to decide. You are married and should make decisions together."
4,ak0zkc,t2_npcu11l,mathxjunkii,"Yeeeaahhhh YTA. Not for complimenting how great your waitress had been to her manager. Don’t get it confused here. Your date didn’t think it was rude of you to want to, in general, give some nice feedback. What was rude was: A. You asked to see the manager, and the waitress clearly communicated that she was worried this would be a complaint, and instead of reassuring her and saying “oh no! Everything was great, I want to tell your manager!” You just repeated that you wanted to speak to the manager..... that poor waitress probably had a whole panic attack on the way over to get him. B. You made it some big song and dance to give positive feedback. Positive feedback is nice, and if your server was particularly exceptional, and you happen to run into the manager on your way to the restroom, or he walks by your table, pointing out how great your server is might be a nice thing to do. But making it into some big production (and please refer to part A for how that all went...) was really sort of arrogant. Also (and this piggy backs on part A)- you used your position as a customer to exercise power over the waitress. Which is a huge red flag for your date. You knew your waitress would need to go get the manager if you asked. You know that when someone asks to speak to a manager there’s usually a problem. You knew that this waitress was worried that you were going to make a complaint about her. Instead of considering how she felt you decided to continue to exercise your power as the customer by ignoring her question, and giving her the exact same command a second time. Your date saw in you a very manipulative little blip. A momentary red flag that told her you understand positions of power, and whether your intentions are good or bad, you intend to exercise your power with little regard to those at your mercy. Your date also saw a man who uses a certain type of gesture to impress a woman. “Let me exercise my power and then ultimately compliment the little guy.” It was all one big flex for you, and mildly patronizing for the waitress, you made her feel helpless and then gave her a pat on the head. Not caring how that waitress felt having to go get her manager, and making it this big show, demonstrated a severe lack of class. Zero regard for others, doing good deeds intentionally with an audience. It’s just all bad.... it’s all red flags. EDIT- it seems like others are really covering the basis here with everything I said in my comment. So I guess I’ll offer a little advice to you. If you like this girl, like you *actually* like this girl, and *genuinely* want to be with her and you want to fix this you need to do 2 things: 1. Admit to yourself that you fucked up during this date. Reflect on that. Try and understand how that waitress felt. Evaluate your thought process when you were going through it and realize that either you were trying to be a big shot, or you had absolutely 0 foresight and ended up looking like an ass. And then fix whichever one of those you conclude to be the problem, and promise yourself you’re going to be a little more conscientious from now on. 2. Call your date, and tell her you fucked up. Admit that you wanted to impress her. Tell her you really like her, you wanted to impress her, and you don’t know why you thought that situation was acceptable. Admit to fucking up. Admit that you wanted to compliment the waitress for her service and went about it horribly and ended up using her as a pawn in your quest to do a good deed. And tell her that you understand how big of a tool she must think you are now. Ask her for one more chance, a date, your treat, on her terms (whatever she wants to do- within reason, obviously, this isn’t fair game to be made into a door mat). And hope that she sees some sort of redeeming quality in that. In all honesty- if this is the only situation that you two have ended up in where she left thinking you were a big douche, you should be able to bounce back from it with some honest self reflection and a genuine apology/explanation.

4,ak0zkc,t2_urb8pnp,BigDisaster,"YTA here, totally. I've worked in customer service for over 15 years and the whole ""let the server/clerk/cashier think they're in trouble until SURPRISE...they're actually not!"" act is never, ever fun. When you freak us out like that it can take a while for the stress to go away--stress hormones don't just vanish the moment we realize everything's okay. You can absolutely sour the rest of our work shift, which is a shitty thing to do to someone you're supposedly hoping to compliment. The next time you want to do something nice for someone else, try to think more about what would actually be nice for *them*."
4,ak0zkc,t2_260b1qxk,totem-spear,"YTA - power trip! It happens, the booze combined with new exciting company. You miss judged the situation, if you like the date, message her that you understand what you did wrong and you just got carried away with the great time you were having. You tried to impress but missed the landing. Acknowledgement of that will get you back in the good books or she probably ain’t the right one for you"
4,ak0zkc,t2_c00cm,EstherandThyme,"Yikes, YTA. The non-asshole way to do what you did would be to say ""Excuse me, I'd love to give some positive feedback to your manager if they are available,"" not dangle the idea that you were going to make a complaint in front of that poor minimum wage worker's face. You were showboating. It was more of a stunt than a genuine compliment and I wouldn't be impressed either if I was your date. Edit: I wonder if you are also the kind of guy who would pull the ""five singles on the table"" act..."
4,ak0zkc,t2_pxerk,Ralphie99,"YTA I assume you wrote this trying to portray yourself in the best light possible. However you still come off as a pompous ass. You made the waitress think that she had done something wrong and made both her and your date feel awkward by not telling the waitress why you wanted to see the manager, despite her asking for a reason. Instead you repeated your request without providing any other info to put her mind at ease. Your date must have been very uncomfortable during this whole interaction. And then, plot twist! You actually wanted to talk to the managed to compliment the waitress! See? You’re a great guy after all! Who wouldn’t want to be your girlfriend? You put on a show for your date and it backfired because you came off haughty and superior. Next time try to act like a normal human being when out on a date rather than putting on a big production to try to impress her."
4,ak0zkc,t2_101pe3,nobel32,"Put yourself in her place, and you'll probably begin to realize why YTA. I'd have been worried sick, if I were instructed to fetch the manager with the customer going ""nope"" at me. And I haven't even ever served a dish in my life. There's this concept here in my country : your date's probably going to treat you the same way he treats his waiters. So it's no big surprise your girl couldn't help but get rubbed the wrong way from your ""clever"" ruse. Honestly, we live and learn, mate. I suggest apologizing to the inconvenienced, and moving on. It's frankly not worth all the brain cells being burnt on it."
4,ak0zkc,t2_lb0pb,free_will_is_arson,"YTA. you may not have intended to be an asshole (which is itself the trademark of an asshole) but you certainly went about it the way an asshole would've. you could've wrote a note on the bill thanking her by name for her great service, management would've seen that. you could've just left an online review. you could've even just left a larger tip than what you were going to. they usually have comment cards for exactly this type of situation. instead you decided to make a bit of a show about it - serious at first, but wait, no it's actually good news. you could've clarified when you asked the second time that it was positive but instead you wanted it to be a surprise, a special moment for your server that she would be grateful to you for giving her. something for her to remember you by, specifically you. id call that pompous at the very least. the other alternative is that you seriously don't see how the way you went about it was pretentious posturing, if you wanted this to just be a little moment than you wouldn't have purposefully drawn out making your point. the real problem with what you did is that you tried to steal back your gratitude, the point to giving accolades to someone for doing a good job and working hard is that you are acknowledging them, *their efforts*. what you were scheming for was after your thank you wanted a '...no, sir, thank *you*'. that's what made you an asshole."
4,ak0zkc,t2_2f8krmr6,gottabkind,"YTA. Seems like the only reason to deliver a compliment this way is to watch the waitress squirm. I can’t blame your date for being turned off watching you take pleasure in making someone worry they’re gonna be in trouble at work. It comes across as a pathetic display of power over someone who’s already subservient to you. Funny to you maybe, because you’re in control of the situation and don’t have anything to lose. Not true for the poor waitress. I guarantee you this girl has already been on plenty of dates with guys who think being a dick to a server, even passively, is some sort of power move that’s supposed to impress her. She was right to call you out on it. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_178m2o,shaggy1452,"I didn’t think you were the ass hole at first, but after reading some of the comments i’m gonna go with YTA. Why would you do the faux angry customer routine? She probably thought she was gonna have to deal with some bullshit customer who’s gonna go off and potentially lose her job. I know that might seem like worst case scenario but i’ve known many restaurant managers who’ll give you the axe over customer complaints."
4,ak0zkc,t2_ssmo1,The_Perfect_Dick_Pic,"YTA. It’s one thing if you know someone and you pull their leg. They know you’re not a total dick and that if you’re legit pissed off, you can talk about it and smooth it out. When you do this to a stranger, they have no idea what your intentions are until you drop the punchline, but that wait is an eternity and the pay off is incredibly small compared to the negative feeling. Imagine walking up to a stranger, acting like you’re going to punch them, then smiling and putting your hand up for a high five. How is that stranger to know you aren’t going to haul off and deck them? How does that stranger know you’re not just getting off on fucking with them? You could walk up to your friend, pretend like you’re going to hit them and they’d think “Weird, OP usually isn’t the type for mindless violence, what’s going on?” Then you go for the high five and you’re friend is all “That’s the OP I know. Had me going there!” People have to feel safe with you before you can scare them and make it funny. And another thing, apologizing for something when you don’t even know what you did (i.e. “whatever I did wrong”) is an incredibly empty gesture. That’s why you got nothing back. If you even have a chance with this woman, it’s in learning what you did wrong, why it was wrong, owning it, and making it right, not just trying to say that you didn’t know and that you intended it to be nice. Good luck."
4,ak0zkc,t2_airpb,clintnorth,YTA. if you did all that on the down-low it would have been fine. but that was very showboat-y of you and there is not way it didn't cause stress for both your server and your date as well. 
4,ak0zkc,t2_hzowf,comalicious,"YTA. I'm kind of in the middle on this one. I too like the compliment excellent customer service, but do I grandstand? No. I calmly ask whoever served me if there is a way I can go a little bit above and beyond what I'd normally do to make sure their boss knows they did an excellent job. If I'm at a restaurant, I personally thank them and leave them a fatty tip. (and I might call in or fill out a survey on their behalf if that is available). What you did was bring it up in such an abrasive and shitty way that the waitress literally was afraid that you had bad service. You made a scene. Why? Why would you ever do that? What made you think that was a good idea? You literally called attention to yourself, and by extension your date, by using a method often employed by those who are upset with their service in order to ""gotcha"" everybody involved. That's embarrassing. She's pretty spot on here. I think you blew it. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_rcmj1,Gouranga56,"yta a bit . i get you were trying to be playful but you did cause her some stress. It also looks like tou are showing off.

4,ak0zkc,t2_j017v,G_Art33,"YTA. You just scared that poor server (weather you meant to or not) to look good in front of your date. Server lose their jobs over dumb bullshit all the time and I’m sure that was exactly what was running through her head. Not shocked your date hasn’t responded yet. Having industry experience when a customer calls for a manager that means something was wrong. she knew this because she asked and I know you knew this because you refused to tell her nothing is wrong. You would be NTA if you had told her “no you were awesome just want to let the manager know how good our experience was”. That would have made everyone happy. You still would get to give your compliment and be NTA, the server wouldn’t be scared shitless that she fucked up without knowing, the manager would know they weren’t going out to a table to comp food and deal with angry people and your date wouldn’t think you were an asshole. That being said - this is one of the better posts I’ve seen on here in a long time. Made me stop and think it through. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_lc6z4kg,UnderApp,"Wow! Really surprised the comments went the way they did. And I wholeheartedly agree. YTA. It's really weird to me that you think it's appropriate to dangle the idea of getting someone in trouble above their head. She even asked you if something was wrong and you fucking ignored her and just ordered her to get the manager again. I know it seems like nothing to you. But this is a huge red flag of controlling behavior. It's like you got some enjoyment out of making the waitress panic, only to swoop in as the hero of your own disaster."
4,ak0zkc,t2_m50rp,MzHarleyQuinn,"Kinda thinking YTA. My first issue is in how you describe your date. Sure, it’s been just a few, but what you seem to like about her is that she’s pretty and silent. Wanting a good listener as a partner is normal...would she get one with you? Secondly, it’s not that you complimented the waitress. Of course that is nice...but you started with some attention-seeking scare tactic that probably had this poor girl internally crying, why? Was the “A-ha, gotcha!” moment worth it? That shit only works on reality TV. And, having worked on it, reality TV is pretty much as awful and manipulative as you can imagine. I’m being as nice as I can be here, but this all reminds me of shit my dad would say and do. It’s not a good thing. He’s a selfish prick. He prefers his wives (and mistresses) Stepford-like. He’ll grandstand like this, reaching for sycophantic gold stars. I haven’t talked to him in years. It’s not like he listens, anyway. I don’t think there’s a cure for narcissistic behavior, but you may not quite gone yet. This is barely a snapshot into your life, and maybe you’re just not great at storytelling? I don’t know. Even so, check your head a bit, cause this shit is not cool. Why did you feel that it was okay to pull a “Gotcha!” on someone who had been doing such a wonderful job? Did she deserve that? EDIT: Oh no, reading more...Y are absolutely TA. Compliments are fine, but fucking pay up. At your job, do you want an atta-boy, or a raise? Fuck off with your archaic shit, and don’t dine out again until your attitude improves."
4,ak0zkc,t2_2vtae1bp,Celi_saannn,"NTA. Either 90%of these people have never worked in food industry or have their heads so far up their ass. You complimented your service, sure you could of gone a much better way around it, but no. Cut your losses and find someone else. I've done retail and foodservice. Sure the anxiety isn't great, but it makes my day knowing I provided someone amazing service AND brought it to the attention of my manager. That's how you literally become well liked by management."
4,ak0zkc,t2_2p0wg69t,inathrowfarfaraway_,"Yeah, YTA. The thought was nice, but you absolutely mangled the execution. Not telling her why you asked to see her manager after she explicitly asked if something was wrong seemed like some weird power play on your part. The message you were giving off to the waitress is “I *could*, get you in trouble if I wanted to, but lets just see what happens”. If you told her that she gave great service and you’d like to compliment her to her manager I guarantee your gesture would have been appreciated, but you chose to act like a dick and pretend like you wanted to rag on the poor waitress. That wasn’t happiness you saw on her face, it was relief. I don’t know if you’ve ever worked in service, but imagine how stressed out you’d be if some guy asked to speak to your manager and then just repeated what he said when you asked him why. That’s what people who want to complain do, so obviously you knew it would be taken that way until she came back with her manager. If I were your date, I’d think that you like to manipulate people a little too much for my comfort. Maybe it wasn’t terrible this time, but that behaviour doesn’t bode well for a relationship. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_pbcjc,buell_ersdayoff,"Was leaning towards NTA but the way you kept the waitress in suspense even after she asked if there was anything wrong was kinda douchy at the very least. If you wanted to talk to her manager for the great service, I don't see nothing wrong with that my self but do it after you tipped her well and in private. So in other words, yeah, YTA."
4,ak0zkc,t2_13k1le,khaosknight69,"This is a late comment and I doubt you'll read it, but the reason everyone is saying you're an asshole is because of how you went about telling the manager your waitress did a good job. You know exactly what it was too, you make deliberate mention of it - ""I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him."" That's not how you do that if the next words out of your mouth are a compliment, that's how you do it when you have a complaint. That's why she asked if there was something wrong. On the trip between your table and her manager she was probably shitting herself wondering what she did wrong. Your tactless manner in which you chose to compliment her turned your compliment into a negative situation. &#x200B; So YTA, but it seems like you may have not intended to be. Still, I will echo the others and your date in that NEARLY ALL PEOPLE understand intrinsically what happened and why things went wrong for you here, and if you really truly don't understand what you did then you're either severely developmentally disabled, or just an asshole. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_17eaqp,YumeMai,"Okay to all the people getting hung up on how he described the date, specifically the ""good listener part"" - not sure if you missed it or intentionally ignored it, but he also called her smart and charming. Do you know how you find these things out about a person? You converse with them. Furthermore this: >Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. Not sure why people are being so aggressive towards OP, seeing as this was simply a misguided execution of good intentions. He didn't say : I thought if I'd make a show of complimenting the waitress, maybe I'd get a threesome tonight, or someshit. Fucking hell people here just randomly pick a poster and assume the worst. In my honest opinion, OP is NTA. I have no clue whether there was an agenda or an ulterior motive. I can only judge based on given information, and so far all I see is, like I said a misguided delivery of compliments for the staff. Yes you can be more straightforward in the future, but I think all you need to do is apologise for creating unnecessary tension and tell the potential gf that it had nothing to do with impressing anyone and you just wanted to show the waitress deserved appreciation, as that is very lacking in the hospitality business. If she is upset about something else then try to get her to open up and resolve it with her. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_2jm45gq8,NuclearInitiate,"YTA Listen, I'm saying YTA, but this is very minor. I don't even really think overall it's that bad. But I do agree with everyone that you did it in an **extremely** douchebag way. The kind of way that makes me think you've never worked in consumer service, and you might not be very empathetic. Keeping someone on the hook, like the waitress, just wasn't a nice thing to do. She has to deal with assholes all day, was already worried about spilling the water, and generally has enough shit on her plate. Tell her she did great. Leave her a good tip. Even do tell the manager. But just be straight forward about it. **The last thing that girl needs** is to spend 5 minutes worrying about whether you're about to flip and become her #1 asshole customer for the night."
4,ak0zkc,t2_761uu,Mcsmack,"NTA. I get what most of the YTA crowd is saying. But you're fine. These guys like to make it out to be that you were in some power trip and putting this poor waitress into a panic attack or something. As someone who worked for years in the restaurant industry, don't sweat it. Wait staff deal with so much worse than someone wanting to compliment them to their boss. And believe me, they can tell pretty early on what kind of customer you are. Unless she was entirely new to serving, she knew what you were up too. Your date decided that it was some sort of power move made to impress her. Which is really ridiculous. Being nice to the wait staff isn't something you do to impress someone, it's a baseline. It's a thing to do to show that you're not an asshole. Looks like most people here can't grasp that. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_4fkjxln,yavanna12,Unfortunately while your heart was in the right place your execution was lacking. So YTA for needlessly worrying the waitress and for pulling a manger away from their work. In most restaurants there is a number you can call or a website to visit on the bottom of the receipt to give feedback on your service. You could have also just told the girl her service was awesome and asked her how you go about letting her manager know. That would have been the appropriate way to give your accolades. 
4,ak0zkc,t2_cincr,iBeFloe,"YTA x2 for how you described these women & acting condescending. Everything you described about the waitress & girl was *incredibly average & easy to find*. You make it seem as though regular waitresses don’t do their job. Then you made a very normal girl seem like she was the best thing since sliced cheese because... she didn’t talk as much as you did about yourself? “Great listener” “isn’t obsessed with herself” I wonder if you realize that in your head, women who TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES ON A **DATE** are an issue lmao. Back to the waitress, “I would like to speak to her manager” “I calmly repeated” Dude. You were hella condescending. Girl probably got happy that you weren’t about to ruin her & get her fired because you refused to tell her why you needed the manager. It’s extremely clear that you like to seem mighty, but you can’t connect the dots."
4,ak0zkc,t2_2yg3kpdm,mintywavey,"YTA, if you genuinely cared about the waitress’s feelings you would have left a bigger tip and thanked her directly for the excellent service. What you did here was quite obviously a power play and I can see why your date reacted the way she did. You sound like a total douche and there was no reason you had to leave the waitress dangling as to what you were going to say to her manager. You honestly come off as someone who feels he’s superior to service workers"
4,ak0zkc,t2_ay7bv,T_Peg,NTA I'm not really sure where people are getting that YTA sure you did it in a shitty way but it all turned out fine for the waitress in the end and I'm not really sure how your date read that scenario to think poorly of you.
4,ak0zkc,t2_nzk2c,cfox0835,"Ooof, definitely YTA man... that’s straight up cringe worthy. You should have just told the waitress she did a great job, why did you feel the need to cause a big scene about it?? I’d have to agree with your date on this one, sounds like you’re very full of yourself. Maybe next time dial things back to reality a bit; or at the very least get more practice with how to behave appropriately in social situations. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_z3w2q,Daegog,"YTA, but i do not honestly THINK you intended to be the asshole via showboating. Me and the old lady routinely tell managers when they have exceptional workers, often in vain hopes that maybe the manager will kick them a few extra hours if they ask. Its not much, but we hope it helps."
4,ak0zkc,t2_aocsy,Thousand_Sunny,like tons of other people have mentioned... I wouldn't have asked for the manager in that way because you could've worked up some unnecessary anxiety in the poor lass but I wouldn't say this is enough for you to be called am asshole so I'm going with NTA. My brothers and I have been through sooo many terrible service situations that when we finally receive really great service as you did we tend to feel the extra bit of energetic happiness as well. I would've first tell the lass how great she was and leave a nice tip in her hands. If I was super ecstatic about it that I wanted the manager to know I would've left a note or phone call without the lass knowing but that much is my personal choice
4,ak0zkc,t2_2vgaxekd,reindeer_14,"YTA for the way you pulled the stunt, but also it's good you encouraged the server, I work in customer service and we get rewared when the customers compliment our service, so do that more often but tell the waitress you'd like to compliment her service rather than just asking for a supervisor as if something was wrong."
4,ak0zkc,t2_ku126,HIMADPEOPLES,"My guy. You had to know this would stress your waitress out and that she would think it was something bad. You definitely did this to try to surprise your waitress like ""Oh haha look I made you think this was bad but in reality I was praising you!"" But life isn't a sitcom dude more often the ""haha gotcha"" is just a dick move especially when it comes to things like your job and livelihood. YTA, you should've told her when she asked instead of just repeating it and making it sound like it was bad news. Don't fuck with people's income dude."
4,ak0zkc,t2_2g97121s,georgiadaviesart,"YTA but everyone here seems to be blowing this way out of proportional. You messed it up by not telling the waitress the second time that you wanted to see the manager for a positive reason. That's all. It was a bit of a dick move, but not as wildly as everyone else is suggesting. If something like that happens again, just be honest, especially if it could cause someone else discomfort. Of course, giving great feedback to the manager is always a great idea when someone is excelling. Just don't cause them anguish in the process. Side note: I used to think that was a cool way to do it also because of movies/Gen Y setting awful examples all around me. But no one will rejoice when you give the good news. They focus on the heart attack you almost gave them. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_j4q96,darthphallic,"YTA for a couple reasons. Your description of the girl just screams narcissistic douchebag to me and the whole little show you put on with the server is showboating at its finest. The best (and most normal) course of action would have been to write a yelp (or google) review on the place and specifically name the server for her exceptional service. Employers and owners read that and it will 100% get back to her. Hell, you could have even just left an exceptional tip and that would have gotten the message across. Idk man, if I was serving and someone asked me to take time to pull my manager over just to pat me on the head like a good dog I’d be pretty weirded out, annoyed even if it were a busy night and I had other tables to take care of. Everything in your post leaves a very heavy impression that you think the universe revolves around you and that what you think is hella important to everyone. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_1fa79a,bmf09598,"NTA, and that girl is a C U Next Tuesday. No clue how anybody can say you're the asshole honestly. You complimented a waitress for doing a fine job. I worked in the food service industry in high school and college and I still to this day remember the time a customer went out of their way to tell my boss I was doing a good job. You spend the entire night only hearing from customers if you did something wrong, so for somebody to go out of their way to recognize your good work, that means a lot."
4,ak0zkc,t2_wily2,StorminWolf,"YTA. Plain and simply because you behaved like one then you did not let her know immediately that its a positive feedback you wanted to provide. I take it you never worked in any customer facing position. If some asshole asks to speak to am manager without giving a context about wanting to give positive feedback, its always an extreme stress factor. &#x200B; I hope the girl dumps your sorry ass, as she should not have to deal with an idiot full of himself like you."
4,ak0zkc,t2_g5tzg,badhershey,"YTA. With a chance of the date's the asshole, too. I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt that you're not as much of an asshole as everyone else has inferred you are from this story. What you did is pretty cringey - at least from the way it's written. Sometimes this stuff doesn't translate well in a text medium. But yeah, don't make a scene to compliment someone. Just compliment them if you must and more importantly leave a good tip. It's hard to say without witnessing it all. But maybe your date took this a bit extremely, but either she's right or she's dramatic, which either way means it's for the best she's not texting back. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_15p9jg,theodonkulus,"NTA. I might ve contrarian here but with a girlfriend who works in customer service and friends who work in the restaurabt industry people appreciate that greatly. If anything i think how your date reacted after dinner was a red flag and you shouldnt have apologized for how you did things. You're human, you ddint cost anyone their job but i think you unintentionally bruised your date's ego. Yes you might have come off incorrectly as how you intended but stick to your words ffs. I really think your date isnt as caring and wonderful as you make her out to be. You'll end upspending a lot on pretty little things who just nod and smile as you feed them. That aint much in terms of listening if shes stuffing her face. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_qy1m8mg,imbrownbutwhite,"Oof. I skipped through most of the story to see where the juicy stuff was but after reading the comments and going back and reading the whole thing, good night. Just all the pointless little details and passive aggressive comments about the waitress and the date. The “she was *actually* quite attentative.” Like she’s a fuckin waitress that’s what they do. Or, “Rare quality of not being full of herself.” I dunno who hurt you but YTA. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_1zkgth24,FuckMotherGothel,"NTA - OP, I think you and I can agree that being a writer or waitress is a pretty difficult job and when you find someone who does 110% to meet your needs, they deserve recognition, However, the way you did it was kinda dickish because you made the waitress feel like you were dissatisfied with her service. That aside, if your date wants to be a bitch about you GIVING positive feedback, dont keep pursuing her. You can tell much more about a person in the beginning of a relationship by how they treat waiters, any kind of janitorial staff, or any other individual fulfilling a ""service"" position. When I first met my SO, i realized that he subconsciously cleaned up the table after our lunch and made it very easy to be bussed, he was very polite to our waitress, and I learned after we started dating that he always tipped at minimum 15%. These things alone give me a pretty good idea of what kind of a person he is. I encourage you to stop pressing your date to talk. If she was upset by whatever you did, she would have to have a pretty good reason for me to even consider her seeing her again because that's a really ridiculous thing to get upset over. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_o4fta,fallonharrod,"YTA for scaring the shit out of the waitress, try to just be a little more mindful of people’s feelings in the future and take this as another lesson learned. Maybe your intentions weren’t bad, and that’s okay, but that just means you need to be extra conscious of how your words and actions may affect others emotionally."
4,ak0zkc,t2_2nx4l1u3,Growupandflyaway,"NTA. People are rrading too much into this. Only you know if your motivation was to be kind or to showboat. I am a server and people do this all the time, granted they are usually older, but it's not like they mean any harm by it. From the fact that she never talked to you again I am guessing there is more to the story to determine if in other areas of your life you are in fact an asshole."
4,ak0zkc,t2_11lli6fn,HotConfusion," Elizabeth and her manifold attractions will remain an enigma, Mr Collins, but your consolations will be many. Your connection to the highly esteemed De Bourgh family will salve the wound greatly, notice from such great persons can hardly fail to please. YTA."
4,ak0zkc,t2_14k5o9,OnionFairy99,"YTA, no doubt in my mind. A lot of people made great points so I'll make this brief, but the execution was incredibly poor. I once thought about doing this same thing. When I was in elementary school with no social skills. As someone with high anxiety and is known for panic attacks, this could have escalated into something horrible for that poor server, and it was incredibly insensitive to do that to her. And after looking over your responses, I can tell you just want to be validated. Well sir, this isn't the right place for that, cause we WILL call you out on your assholes behavior"
4,ak0zkc,t2_1vnbgd0i,Whatchagonnadowhen,"Oh friend. Controlling, full of yourself friend. YTA. And you still don't get it! Some people believe the relief that waitress felt was not worth the heart pounding fear you gave her for however long MR MASTER BURGER JOINT MAN's opinion was in question. So let's recap: 1) Your opinion of a burger waitress matters so much (to you) that... 2) You struck terror in burger waitress in such a way that... 3) You made your self importance completely obvious and... 4) You're not only proud of that, you're mad that someone else isn't impressed by your magnanimity. And unrelated, but... *ask her to be your girlfriend?* That seems...youthful. Your self importance even oozes out of you with your pride in taking date to a burger joint. Which was nice of course, and I shouldn't take this to the extreme I'm about to, because you're not a bad person. But you seem to think that women should be grateful for any interaction you're willing to share with them. I'll still upvote you for asking though!"
4,ak0zkc,t2_2nwg0xkq,Island_universe0,"YTA. I used to work as a waitress and what you did would have made my heart sink and cause me tremendous anxiety. it's kind of show offy to find a manager and tell them their waitress is great even if you don't do it in the weird shitty way you did. It's a little degrading and shows that you think you're above them, instead of equals. You wouldn't do this to someone in a none minimum wage (or close to) roll. But acting like you are going to complain to the manager, and not letting her know that that's not what you're doing when it becomes evident that that's what she thinks it's crazy douchy. You suck."
4,ak0zkc,t2_10fgnj,super_common_name,"YTA. But you would be YTA even without the whole scary prelude because **that's way too much focus on the server and not enough on your date.** Maybe if you'd been dating a long, long time AND your date was included in your plan, like ""That was a great server; let's tell her manager, okay?"" It still seems like something a couple who had been married 30 years might do, though. Also, the whole ""**ask her to be my girlfriend**"" thing. Are you 14 years old? If you meant that you wanted to ask her to be exclusive, it's way too early for that. You need a couple of months worth of regular dating. Third date is the traditional first time you have sex. Being in a relationship is a gradual buildup."
4,ak0zkc,t2_2s0tpe91,Flappybird11,"YTA, work in a crappy burrito joint, some asshole played this trick on, I made him his crap burrito, he payed for his shit, and he asked for my boss, I just went straight to her and got her, spooked already (I have autism so I tend to make mountains out of molehills and panic over little things) and he did the ""oh he did good"" bullshit on me (honestly that was probably the worst burrito I have made) that whole thing scared me so bad I had to sit in my little corner for 15 minutes to calm myself down!"
4,ak0zkc,t2_316d73lh,BeholdYou_is_my_kik,YTA. For all the reasons everyone has already said. You realise that poor waitress probably spent several minutes completely bewildered and worried because she thought she was going to be in trouble and had no idea why? She probably wasn’t so much pleased at the end as relieved. Not that you care because you just want to show-off. No wonder your date was unimpressed. 
4,ak0zkc,t2_3t2qd2x,bindhast,I think the crowd is getting extra hostile 9n OP. Did he screw up with that lil stunt of keeping his intention secret? Yup. But I think people are gunning him for everything they can lay their hands on. I think he was complimenting his girl by saying she is a great listener- which is actually a very hard skill to have. He also complimented her for being smart and funny. IMHO- it was commendable for him to make sure the waitress’ manager knows she is an excellent employee. This at times can be more valuable than a monetary tip. NTA
4,ak0zkc,t2_29hqpsx2,Lady_krolux,"YTA Not only is that the most obnoxious way to compliment wait staff I coild think of, but then you actually said ""sorry for whatever I did wrong"". That doesnt earn you brownie points, I'd rather you didn't apologize than gey that load of bollocks of I were on a date with you. Get your head out of your ass and learn from this experience."
4,ak0zkc,t2_x0cyrn0,stonerplumber,YTA The whole weird may I speak to your manager part makes you an ass. Why give someone the anxiety and draw attention to you and your date by having the manager and the waitress come out and talk to you at your table. 
4,ak0zkc,t2_ztbew,garmdian,YTA ya ment well but it was little too overboard. Explain to your date that you just genuinely care for good people and want to see them get recognized because that is the right thing to do in a world where people get after you for the small things. Or just too good that works as well.
4,ak0zkc,t2_re7z4,JackoffSmirnof,"YTA but maaaaaaaan it's so close. I think it's been beat to death, but if you had just told her she did a great job and left her a nice tip, it's all the same to her. That being said, your date overreacted a little. She didn't have to go there and make it seem that serious, you were only joking around with the waitress (also, partly I'm sure why she's mad at you, maybe fairly) and meant no ill intent. &#x200B; Much like the Saints, you have a legit beef here but you still aint going to the super bowl. You can add euphemisms for in her pants if you like. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_2mjuoy0y,1MillionIn2019,"NTA Misguided, corny, lack of empathy, and stupid, but not an asshole. You shouldn't have dangled the compliment like that even if you thought ""everyone loves a surprise."" This might flag you as ""could be an asshole, so look for more signs"" but this encounter alone does not make you an asshole. However, i will say that the girlfriend here could be labeled as an asshole. The passive-aggressive ""was *that* supposed to impress me"" instead of being direct about what you did wrong is borderline. But ghosting someone is immature and asshole behavior. Unless you fear for your safety, you should be mature enough to tell someone if you don't want to talk to them and should probably let them know why. Ghosting is 10 year old kid's behavior."
4,ak0zkc,t2_jahab,iRepth,"I read your post and expected to see a stream of people bitching about how obvious it was that you are NTA. You are NTA. I don't know if none of these people ever worked in the restaurant industry before, but I did for many years, and whenever people asked to see the manager I was always happy to oblige. Positive feedback direct to the boss often goes a long way. Though very rarely, sometimes when I'm out to dinner I will also ask to speak with the manager to praise the server for providing exceptionally good service. Your mistake was apologizing to your date after she was rude to you when you'd done nothing wrong in the first place."
4,ak0zkc,t2_2nvigvrd,Misskwy,"NTA in my humble opinion and I do not understand why everyone is whining about the surprise you pulled to the waitress. I think it's a smartass move, yes, but I also appreciate that kind of humour. I've had customers do this to me when I was a manager, telling how my employees were doing a great job. I loved it and so my employees, after those few seconds of dread of 'oh dear, am I in trouble?' and then everyone had a laugh about it. You people need to chill, jeez."
4,ak0zkc,t2_7i4vc,hallgod33,"NTA, only way I could see it being YTA is if you were responsible for holding someone's hand and managing their emotional responses to things at every second. The benefit a good server gets from a customer telling the manager overrides any ""bravado or braggadocios behavior"", you just secured her 10-20% more earnings over the next month at the very least. If the date doesn't respect that, she's clueless to life and how people need to work hard to earn things. It SHOULD impress her, imo, cuz it doesn't matter if you did it like an autistic kid, you still did something great for that server. She proly feels like you shit-tested her or was spreading around your affection. A fat ass tip doesn't do nearly as much as someone thinks unless they're literally tipping 200%. No one's fucking 20 bucks makes that big of a difference. Informing the manager makes a real difference. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_2031qqpo,NifflerOwl,"Gonna go against the grain and say NTA. Yeah, you should have told the waitress you were getting the manager to compliment her, but that was just a dumb mistake. Also I think you were fine when describing the girl. ""Great listener"" doesn't automatically mean they don't talk, it means that they know when to talk about themselves and when to respond to you. If you had genuinely good service then it's not bad to tell the manager. And everyone saying he should just tip: he probably did, but telling the manager she did a good job will probably get her a promotion sooner. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_13g3ky83,kmtitus,"NTA, depending on actual tone of the back and forth i could see why your date is not impressed. Your date probably wanted your attention and a tip with kind word would have sufficed for the (imo - normal service). Doesnt make you the a hole for saying something nice to soome though.

Luckily you don't have a nice car and the driver of the other car was probably doing something illegal (stolen car, drunk, drugs, no liscense, warrents) so they left.

But you don't get to tell your grandfather how to mourn or refuse to let him move on because you can't move on. You shouldn't be punishing him or his girlfriend because you're struggling. These are people who's feelings matter too. It's been over a year since your grandmother passed. I'm sorry but it's time to let your grandfather have a normal life. Moving on is healthy and normal. I would understand if it was still only six months later and the relationship was still new but they've been together for awhile now. This girlfriend is a part of his life and is important to him. I don't want to tell you how to mourn or how to process your loss but you really need to talk to a professional. It's not healthy to hold onto pain this long.

It's very nice that you are considering their feelings but you're not the asshole accepting their aid help at a school that would be better for you. Turn the facts a little bit. Say U gives you a full ride but has a shitty program for what you want to do. School X would require financial help (loans, parent money) but has one of the top programs in the country for what you want to do. Would you feel guilty going to X over U in those circumstances? I wouldn't, and the principle is basically the same. "

4,anfda0,t2_11w15zni,K19081985,"NTA - we are at a time where saying insensitive things is less funny and more.... well, insensitive. It’s okay to quietly pull this person aside and say “hey, you know what - OCD is a real thing and it affects a lot of people. As someone officially diagnosed with OCD, I find it offensive when people use it casually describe the fact they prefer a normal amount of order.” That’s if you’re willing to out yourself, of course. Personally, in situations like these, it depends on the person. I’m an adult with autism. You’d be surprised how casually that is also thrown around. For me, it depends on my audience. If it’s someone I think will actually listen and give a shit about my perspective, I’ll engage. If it’s someone who I think doesn’t care I generally won’t bother. "
4,anfda0,t2_1fz5nlgh,ListenToYourDad,"NTA It's obnoxious when people talk about their ""self-diagnosed OCD."" You could absolutely talk to him about it privately and respectfully so he can understand where you're coming from. I'm not sure what you mean by ""calling him out."" When I hear that, I assume it means calling someone out publicly and ridiculing them, which certain situations do call for. However, it sounds like your goal is to have him understand and respect where you're coming from. If you don't really know this kid that well, he might not be that receptive to a conversation about it, in which case I would say just keep silently judging because it wouldn't be worth the confrontation."

The kids saw that their ball had broken your window and scattered. They didn’t take any responsibility for their actions, didn’t even come to knock on your door to apologise, they were trying to climb over your gate to sneakily retrieve their ball and run off. When you approached them, they simply demanded their ball back, again, no apology even!"
4,adrfbl,t2_fozz9,m4uri,"**NTA** And I am appalled that most of the reddit people see you differently. You spoke to the parents BEFORE you spoke to the children BEFORE.

Shit like that happens. You scared the hell out of him and crushed him by destroying what seems like one of his favorite toys. Remember being a kid, and how it felt to have a toy that was that important to you? Imagine some psycho gutting it with a hunting knife. The right thing to do would've been to not even answer the door or just tell him to go home. Take pictures of the whole scene (the broken window, glass, ball and the cut) for evidence. Then after your daughter was comforted and bandaged, bring the ball over to the kid's house. Then confront the parents. Tell them what's happened. Tell them politely but firmly what's been going on and what you expect of them. Deal with it like an adult, directly, with other adults. If you're getting advice from anyone here who told you what you did was right, you're getting advice from children."
4,adrfbl,t2_6egvdu6,MaxxPwnage,YTA. You’re an adult. You should know better than to scare a child over that when you simply could’ve kept the ball and talked to his parents about reimbursing you for the window.

4,adrfbl,t2_e53tmjo,throwawayaccount6622,"YTA. Though I can undertsand you were justifiably pissed off, but this wasn't the right reaction. As others said, you should have kept the ball, gone outside to tell them something to the effect of ""I am very, very unhappy at what you just did. I have repeatedly told you not to play ball outside my house because I knew you would end up causing damage. You have broken my window and the ball also hit \[name of daughter\]. So I'm keeping the ball and will be talking to your parents"". That way, they would have been punished by you by keeping their ball until you see their parents. And presuming the parents are not massive assholes, they will be very apologetic about the broken window and that your daughter got hurt (maybe they just thought you were being over the top thinking that this situation would happen). That would enable them to punish the kids, pay for the window, get their kids to apologise to yours, and tell them not to do it again. If this doesn't stop them, get legal advice on what you can do about the situation. THEN you can wage war on the parents, not the kids who frankly are too young to have even understood why you didn't want them playing ball in the first place. I remember being a child playing outside and not understanding some adult's frostiness towards us, and remember just thinking they were horrible people. Your issue is with the parents, not the kids, not beyond telling them off and keeping the ball until further notice. Edit: typo."

From the sounds of it, things weren't going to change. Dealing with the kid's stuff from across the street is annoying enough, but when he's even trying to climb your fence to get on *your* property, and then the huge thing with the window... no. What you did was still overboard. But honestly from the sounds of it the parents aren't doing enough, and who knows if they might even try to fight paying the window... So to the people saying that them paying it would be enough, idk, maybe what you did will shock the kid into listening at least"
4,adrfbl,t2_k9002u8,NeoPoe,"ESH, and you lost any ground to request the kids parents pay for the window due to your intentional destruction of their property as retaliation.

They were told multiple times, but this time it broke a window and injured a child. They’re lucky you aren’t going after the parents for the cost of the window and medical bills. I think the entitled parent-ness that I see on this thread is exactly why r/childfree not only exists but gets more and more popular. "
4,adrfbl,t2_2r2x81rp,I_run_Arch_BTW,"YTA. Yeah, he destroyed your property and ignored your warnings. He's a kid. You should've done something like ""you'll get your ball back once you apologize to my daughter and organize some way to pay back the damages"". Obviously he's a kid and wouldn't have much money but then he would have to get from his parents or pay you back over time. Destroying his ball in front of him definitely wasn't appropriate. To be clear, his parents were assholes too for not controlling/disciplining him properly. When I was a kid, if another parent complained to mine about something I did, I was terrified because I knew they would take the other parent seriously if I was actually guilty and discipline accordingly. In this case the parents didn't bother. They should've had to pay for the window and you should've made the kid do chores or something for his ball back."
4,adrfbl,t2_16rdjzx8,ReddiStediGo,NTA but also the asshole I totally understand why you cut their ball in half but you could of done it another way such as walking to his parents house and speaking to their parents then the parents would of most likely took the football off him for awhile and they would give it back at a later date

This kid will respect you more than he ever has and will probably protect your house from other kids during this situation.

I bet the only reason the turd burgler came back to ask for the ball is because he hadn't told his parents he broke your window and hurt your kid and he knew that if he came home without the ball the parents had given him for Christmas they would want to know what happened to it. It all would have been hidden or only come put after the fact. Kid got a solid lesson in behaviour today.

I’m sure I’m going to get a lot of shit for this, but you requested multiple times for them to watch where they kick the ball. Boo hoo. It’s a $15 soccer ball. How about the cost of the window and potential stitches for your kid. The endorphins that must have hit your brain when you stabbed that ball —- makes me a bit envious. "

It's not something you just have to do by default, especially when they're making so many egregious mistakes on their own. Guilt tripping is a manipulation tactic that creates the WORST mental feedback loops, hence feeling bad for taking care of yourself. I suggest checking out r/JustNoFamily and seeing a therapist if you're able. This is going to feel rough for the first few months. I know because I'm doing it.

Then, when his father took us to dinner, he backed into my car while showing off his back-up camera (rare in 2005!) The point is, **I thought “I need a drink,”** and then felt horrible about it being the start of a bad habit! (I was 1 year past the drinking age) But, it was just a drink, it turns out. A few years later, I ended up having CPTSD, and I completely abstained from alcohol during that time. NOTE: you *should* intervene if it impacts his life negatively. Until then, let him adult. ~=~=~=~ Edit: seeing your reply that “we are not adults” doesn’t change much here. You’re adults in training.

They are willfully not acknowledging the fact that, ""jokes,"" are a lot less, ""funny,"" when they're at your expense. I would bet it's his unpleasant personality that loses him dates much more than his lack of height. Attractiveness isn't just about physical beauty. It may be what catches the eye at first, but it's the personality that makes someone a keeper. Just as a word of encouragement don't let anonymous cruelty, and obvious douchebags get you down.

Take her out for coffee and lay out that your courseload is more than you thought it would be, and the cruise is not looking like it’s going to be a wise decision. If it’s possible to get a refund, it would help your stress level a lot to know that money is providing a buffer just in case, perhaps their customer service line would be able to refund her if you explained the situation.

I’ve had a bad relationship with food most of my life and when my mom would say stuff “trying to help” it tended to make me go out and sneak lots of food because I felt guilty eating in front of her.

For the record, all bodies are different and there is no one style of eating that works for everyone. Everyone's optimal macros are different.

If you’re passionate about your new lifestyle and you’ve bonded with your gf over it, I understand how you’d feel entitled to comment on what she eats. Maybe similar to how athletes would say ‘hey, why did you miss practice today?’ if one of them didn’t show up. So I get where your comment to her came from but just make sure she genuinely wants and enjoys being on this journey with you. Judging by her reaction, I think she’s not having a great time.

Like, to anyone, not just your girlfriend. Strict diets are super hard to follow, and you feel like a jackass if your partner is doing one and you can't give up carbs to do the same. Cut her some slack. If you're concerned about her weight or eating habits, there are more tactful ways to go about it. For example, make enough of whatever you eat to feed her, too. Suggest you go on a hike later. Shit like that. Don't ever comment on how bad something is for a person when they're about to stuff their face with it. Odds are they already fucking know."

There should be an end game of the two of you in the same zip code or moving on. I understand this far more than you know.

People who leave home at 18 either A) have well off parents who can help pay for their rent/food/tuition B) Get massive loans to cover school Or C) work multiple low paying/entry level jobs that can allow them to barely scrape by. Don't spin this as ""teaching her responsibility"" because you clearly just don't like her and if you think you can just kick her out, regardless of what your fiance thinks or feels, then you don't value you her opinion and I feel bad for her.

Rent, Bill's and food alone comes to around £1200 a month if you're talking very very cheap. Her salary in a salon probably wouldn't cover that. You're condemning her to a life of late payments, not being able to make savings, not being able to enjoy herself, possibly getting into debt, just so you can get rid of her cause you dont really like having her around. Your relationship with your girlfriend would probably not fair too well if you kicked her daughter out; contrary to what you may believe. Your stepdaughter doesn't have to like you and you dont have to like her. But you should treat her like you would your own flesh and blood if you want your relationship with your girlfriend to last. Kicking out your stepdaughter will only give her ammunition to dislike you and probably would make your girlfriend rethink too."
4,b1z6r2,t2_9u2dl,VortexMagus,"YTA I think really what makes you the problem in this situation is that you're not willing to accept the package deal. Typically when you date someone or marry someone, you accept that you're dating their child, too. Sounds to me like you want the lady in deal but not her daughter, which is just not how it works. I don't think it's your fault that the daughter's relationship didn't work out - sounds to me like she's been damaged in some way previously and is putting up walls to ensure it doesn't happen again. It sucks to be excluded out of a dynamic like that, especially when you appear to have gone out of your way to try and make sure she lives a good life. But that all being said, I think you have every right to kick the daughter out of your house that you paid for, you should just accept that if she goes it'll probably take the mother with her. It sounds to me like you want to keep one and kick the other out, against both their wishes, which is where you became the asshole. It appears very selfish to me, as you have decided your own immediate happiness is more important than the long-term happiness of the daughter and the mother combined. I feel like a better method here would be family counseling, so that you could ask for the respect you feel entitled to, and air your grievances, and the daughter could do the same, and hopefully you could come out of it with some actual familial bond instead of whatever messed up, dysfunctional relationship you appear to have now."

But also you're just gonna give up on the relationship because it's a little bit hard on you so it sounds like there's a reason she resents you. Maybe she went through a hard time with her biological father and the divorce? You can't just build a relationship with gifts. I feel really bad for this girl because my stepdad loves me like his own daughter. He's never even called me his ""stepdaughter"". It was a hard adjustment but he learned how I receive love and used that to foster a real relationship. I've been bitchy to him because I was (surprise, surprise) a fucking teenager. But he never just threw in the towel. He knew that love is a commitment. You obviously made at least an attempt, but she might not see you giving her things as love. Have you even tried talking to her like an adult? Asking her about her feelings? Not listing all the things you buy for her and trying to be understanding? You're treating her like an optional add-on to your ""fiancee"" and you should be treating her as a part of your family. You had to win over and get to know your partner before she started to love you and move in. Why would your stepdaughter be any different? "

Very few people move out right at 18 these days because it takes longer to stabilize yourself in this economy. Parents tend to understand that having some time to save and build a safety net goes a long way to set your children up for success. If I was you partner I would be absolutely livid that you would treat my child that way and essentially try to make a parenting decision for me.

You expect your stepdaughters eternal gratitude but I highly doubt you've really taken the time to get to know her (you didn't even know she wasn't planning on college). How hard have you *really* tried to be a father figure to her (buying her a car is a nice gesture but it doesn't scream that you love her)? It sounds like she knows you don't give a shit about her and keeps her distance from you to avoid getting hurt. You are jealous (wanting to have the house just for you and your fiance) and incredibly selfish (even though your fiance loves having her daughter there you put your own desires above hers). I hope your fiance leaves you and finds someone better. She deserves it. &#x200B; >I really feel like I’ve put my time in &#x200B; I'm going to be a little bit of an asshole now but FU for that comment.

That being said, once 18 you have two life paths: continue your education or start your career (and pay your own way). Doesn’t mean you don’t help her get on her feet or save up for deposit/first months rent and bills. But there should be a clear and reasonable plan with dates and timelines.

I would say you and your wife need to come up with a said move out date. Make it reasonable. U will feel better knowing there is a date. Your missus and the girl will be more understanding as they have some time to prepare. You’ve dealt with this for awhile so be just a little more patient. You will seem much more reasonable and it will go smoother. Set it up for say 90 days. U will have to make it clear that you will go to legal eviction if necessary. I would say watch and wait. If she’s told 90 days and in 40 days she’s still coming home to mom talking about getting her nails done and she’s not working extra hours or even looking at apartments ect. Then you know what your going to have to do. I would go to the police or legal paperwork and get it started At 60 days as usually u have 30 days after legal notice. This is u sticking to your 90 days. That’s plenty of time to look, save, and start collecting stuff for a first place. If your missus wants to give some her shit away to the youngster and buy new for her and you I would give this a pass and not make it an argument unless it’s really pricey. Or say well u can give it away but when we buy new I’m going with you to pick and there will be a budget. That will keep the missus from giving away everything! Decide if the item in question is really worth fanning the flames of a fire. remember your missus wants or is enjoying her there too. Also if your gone a lot and your missus will be extra lonely when her daughter leaves be prepared to fill that hole at least a little or you will be the asshole to them both. "
4,b1z6r2,t2_2zxj46f7,catsforthewin1234,NTA Going against the grain here it'd completely understandable for you to want her out when she gives you nothing in this relationship.

I will say, to some degree, it sounds like you're sticking with this relationship out of some socially-instilled sense of obligation.

The kid is a nightmare it sounds like but it’s just really bad taste to single out one kid because of being on the spectrum and seems like that in itself would cause drama. Your fiancé is right.

He might enjoy himself more in an environment he's not forced to sit and watch you come down the aisle and the long ceremony part, but maybe he can still feel included being there for the mingling? If is dad isn't in the wedding part but invited, if you communicate your concerns calmly before hand maybe he can be prepared to remove him in case of outbursts? I'm not sure how realistic that is, but I don't think too many kids are going to be upset about not being at a wedding in 20 years, it might be worth it to go no kids to keep peace and save friendships."

It may not be abuse, but it's 100% harassment and they as adults do NOT have to tolerate that. Op, you do NOT owe anything to your foster parents. Sure, they took you in as if you were they're own, but that means taking on the responsibility to raise you to adulthood. After that is fair game. You go off on your own, as an adult, and may make a life for yourself with or without your foster parents (entirely up to you). Some people continue to see their foster parents, some don't. Sounds like they need to ""wake up and realise"" that you're an adult, you're wife is an adult, and you make decisions for yourself now. Wifey can keep her job and her autonomy.

They don't deserve grandchildren, no one deserves anything related to other people having a child, but it seems unlikely, based upon my own experience and experience others have shared in other subs, that they will ever realize that. Some may say it is an overreaction, and they aren't exactly wrong, but sometimes when people constantly hound you over things they can't wrap their heads around, you have to take an extreme action to get them to lay off. I'd give it time, maybe a week, maybe a month, maybe until the next holiday your family gets together, and tell them you want to see them but they need to respect your decisions and not hassle you over it."

If so you need to exhaust that route before anything else. Again I don't know your countries legal system, but in the US this wouldn't be something to involve the police in. Instead you'd probably file something with small claims court or report the company to a consumer protection agency. &#x200B; Edit: Just realized you compared it to Craigslist, I was thinking it was more along the line of Wish or something with third party sellers.

There's nothing wrong with confronting someone about a lie they've been repeating to you. Further, the reason she keeps ghosting you is because she knows she's in the wrong and doesn't want to have to face the consequences or guilt. She would rather run away from her problem than dealing with it. &#x200B; BTW The situation as I see it, she likes you emotionally and physically. But she finds her friend more physically attractive, she doesn't see him as a long term possibility, as he is prob a bit of an asshat because of his good looks, and wants you as her backup when she is ready to leave him. Don't fall for this, and don't take her if she comes to you, she'll likely cheat on you in your relationship from all of the red flags shown up to now. She has a bit of a narcissistic personality (armchair psychologist, take that with a grain of salt) and she will choose what she desires over commitment. She'll get emotional fulfillment from you while taking up guys who hit on her that she finds attractive. &#x200B; Anyway, NTA, keep the no contact going even if she tries to end it.

4,audeqz,t2_2dzsp6uu,Lalabeth93,"YTA. Your friends are right to be shocked because it is cruel. Declawing is so horrible. You would be cutting the top of a cats finger off, not the nail, the actual finger. Decline comes with a bunch of health risks to. Cats can end up with chronic pain and end up with difficulty walking. Their feet get so sensitive that they can't walk in a litter box so you'll end up with a cat goes to the bathroom all over the house. You're removing the first line of defense so you could end up with a cat who bites and it's a lot more aggressive. And it doesn't matter if there indoor cats they do need to defend themselves against other cats against you and if they can't swat, they will use their teeth."
4,audeqz,t2_m8sd4t1,Christwriter,"YTA Or rather YWBTA. It deliberately cripples kitties because their owners can't be arsed to learn kitty behavior. If you are concerned for your furniture, buy a log with bark on it. If you are worried about scratches, learn why cats scratch and don't do their triggers anymore. You also need to be aware of the HUGE impact declawing has on a kitty. First, they will be in considerable pain. A declawed cat no longer has use of its declawed toes, as all methods of declawing severe the tendons, so a declawed cat walks on their ""heels"", something those bones aren't designed for. That often causes early onset arthritis. The law pads operated on often become hypersensitive, making scratching and digging behavior too painful. Which means all your litterbox training goes down the tubes. The most common method of a declaw, amputating the toe bone at the first knuckle, commonly leaves fragments of the nail bed in the paw. These fragments grow without an outlet and cause considerable pain by themselves, sometimes even puncturing the paw pad. Finally, there is the psychological impact of losing their claws. This is their first line of defence. Without it, they become anxious and fearful. Some cats become aggressive and prone to damaging bites. Others become timid and hide under the nearest safe object. They believe that if anything attacks them they will probably die. Any behavioral problems that existed before the declaw will grow exponentially. The end result of a declaw is an animal with serious special needs. They need special physical care, an understanding owner who can handle potty accidents and an environment that makes them feel safe and secure. Most owners cannot handle this, and a declawed cat is far more likely to be abandoned at a shelter than a clawed one. You can cap kitty's claws or give them a regular manicure. But please, if you cannot handle a couple scratches and claw marks on furniture, for the cat's sake go get a fucking gerbil. "
4,audeqz,t2_1h6cb5xq,t40rn,Sorry I'm late. Yta for even thinking about that. Honestly you may want to consider learning about cats online and from books. Or if you don't it may be time for you to give them to someone who understands animals better.

4,audeqz,t2_2uyprrg,HailCrystals,"YTA. Please, *please* don't get them declawed! Declawing is incredibly painful for cats, they remove the *bone* when they declaw, it's awful, and can cause your kitties pain :( Watch Jackson Galaxy's video on why he doesn't advocate for declawing cats. If you are having problems with them scratching things etc. there are plenty of safer steps that you can take! I know they don't need to use their claws to hunt prey, but that's part of their nature. That would be like removing a fundamental part of human nature from your body that makes you who you are. I just saw your edit, I'm really glad you've reconsidered. Your kitties will be much happier for it <3"

4,a3vjz3,t2_qrfkb,cautionjaniebites,NTA You're in a situation that is easy to judge harshly but those who feel anything more than sadness for your whole family..they are the ass holes. They think they can even begin to fathom what your household is experiencing? No way. What you're feeling is natural for what you're experiencing. And I think you need to find more specialized treatment for your son as well as you and your husband. Maybe even intense residential care will be necessary. 
4,a3vjz3,t2_e9f47,AceofToons,"I once was in a relationship with a woman who had a kid (I loved this little girl with all of my heart, loved her as my own) but she had behavioural problems, similar to my own as a child and at one point in private I expressed my exasperation to my partner in a not so nice frame set and then expressed how horrible I felt for feeling that way. She looked me dead in the eye and said ""Sometimes I hate her too. Every parent has moments like that. You can't blame yourself for feeling that way sometimes. Ultimately your actions are all that matters."" You aren't the asshole for feeling the way you do. For what it's worth I ended up fucking up that relationship because I had undiagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder, it's ""curable"" as much as that word can be applied to any mental based issues. The mind can only learn programing on top of existing programming, the previous programming still exists, we just learn to override it and with time and effort we can learn to override it faster and have more contingencies in place, but it can only be done one step at a time and even once new, more desirable, behaviours have become the default reaction to situations the old programming still exists and may come out. I am unfamiliar with RAD and all of its challenges, but if after therapy its better, even for a short while, that leads me to believe that progress can and will be made, bit by bit. Does the therapist have any advice on how to respond to outbursts?"
4,a3vjz3,t2_5jquo,Coziestpigeon2,"NTA for how you're currently feeling and possibly how you'll deal with the situation. I can't imagine being in your place and having to deal with something like this, and absolutely don't think you're an asshole for how you're feeling or for what you might need to do. YTA for going through an adoption without being ready for this kind of outcome. It's like a (much more) extreme version of the kid who gets a puppy before realizing that they need to take it for walks and pay for vet appointments and train it not to destroy shit. Your situation sounds awful, but it also is not that exceptional or rare. I don't know if you just never expected this as a possibility, or if you just weren't truly ready for it to be as bad as it is, but damn. This was your responsibility to learn and prepare for before adoption. Now this kid's life is, arguably, on a worse track than it would have been if he was just left at the orphanage. Again though, with the situation being what it is, I don't think you're an asshole, and I do think you might need to do something drastic in order to make your situation safe at home again, and that wouldn't make you an asshole either. I honestly wish you the best of luck, and can't imagine having to be in your shoes. I hope you're able to make it to the other side of this alright. "

You had no control over what went into that fetus body before birth, nor how he was raised during his most formative years. He was in a different country in a very different culture. The RAD diagnosis is is rough. It can lead to severe consequences for the entire family, and if you as a parent feel that you are not safe, in your own house, and you are no longer able to raise this child, you are justified in returning him to an environment where he can get the professional care he needs."
4,a3vjz3,t2_2ayzcos,Car_the_boat,Gonna get down votes but NTA at all. In fact I would go as far as to say you would be justified in returning him. It's easy to judge from the outside but potentially 10+ years of this? That's really damn rough. You are going to need some damn near superhuman self Control. Either he'll get better or be one of those kids who grow up to have serious issues and shoot up a school or something. It'll be shitty to leave him but honestly in time you won't care nor anyone on this sub.

Nowhere in this have you actually shown any indication that you'd actually give him back. Venting is fine and healthy. If there's a forum that has a group of people who also have experiences with children with RAD, it would definitely be good to form a support group there with them. I also highly, highly recommend finding more IRL support. Talking online is good and still an outlet to vent, but you need people around you to help provide support. It sounds like you have some people in your life but not many that could fill this role. This by itself will make the load a little lighter, a little more bearable, even if just slightly - and sometimes getting that slight relief in itself makes a huge difference. You're not a bad person. A bad person wouldn't adopt a child needing a home and spend countless hours and monies trying to get said child help when he started exhibiting problematic behavior. Let me say that again. ***YOU'RE NOT A BAD PERSON***. A bad person would not have done what you've done for him or reach out for comfort - and that's what you're doing here, you're looking for comfort and reassurance so that you don't lash out at the child. And again, there's nothing wrong with having feelings like this. You need to work through them, sure, but you're in a situation where you're just exhausted emotionally and physically. A lot of people don't know what that's like - and honestly, they should count their blessings. I've never experienced exactly what you're going through, but I've had other family issues and experienced some things that just left me feeling utterly depleted. You're normal, OP. You're a human being and it's OK to wish that you could walk away from everything."

At the point that his adopted mom was locking her four oldest children outside in the sleet in January because he was so violent they realized he needed more than they could give him. They had him placed in therapeutic foster care and he was doing great but DHS will no longer pay for him to be in care. They are putting him back up for adoption and making sure they choose a family that knows what he needs and is able to provide it. They didn’t know the extent of his FASD when they adopted him and nobody told them how bad it could be. He was 2 the first time he ripped a door off the hinges. His biological parents are very very tall, his adoptive parents are not. At 3 he was taller than his 6 yr old brother. They could not create a safe place for any of their children. This is probably the hardest thing you will ever have to do and a lot of people are going to make you feel like garbage. I hope you can find some help and comfort. Finding him a home where he can thrive and hopefully work past some of this. "

This is a really tough situation.

There is nothing about his post that says you have mentally accepted that he is your son. You only call him your adopted son once in the title to summarize the question. You don't say you love him. You don't sound like you opened your heart to him. You talk about him like he's a teenage roommate. You've had your son since he was THREE. This is YOUR SON. You are his whole world and that is a choice YOU made. Gee, I wonder why he's acting out. Think he can sense all this? My son is 7 and has been kicked out of preschool for violence and kicked out of private school in first grade for violence. Almost kicked out of kindergarten for violence. He hit neighbors' kids until their parents refused to let them play. No one ever suggested giving him up for adoption. It never crossed our mind. Because he's OUR SON. We did occupational therapy, some psychiatrists, and a 5mg daily dose of Adderall. He's always been an angel in my eyes but now everyone else sees it. Now he's in scouts, jiu jitsu, soccer, and basketball. He had a ton of friends and reads like lightning. I'm not saying ""hang in there and it will get better."" I'm saying ""maybe if you start actually loving the poor SIX YEAR OLD YOU ARE THINKING OF DEPORTING you might see him stop acting like a SIX YEAR OLD WHOSE MOTHER DOESN'T LOVE HIM AND WANTS TO DEPORT HIM."" I guess I can't answer the asshole question because it's invalid. ""AITA for wanting to deport my son?"" doesn't work because you would never deport your son. You don't see him as your son. Side note: I hope you have been aware during all the separate families and deport children at the Mexican border that you have no room to talk. I went and looked up RAD.

4,a3vjz3,t2_sz43n,theanamazonian,"YTA - What if if was your biological child who had a mental health issue? Would you just abandon them too? You agreed to take that child as if it was your own when you adopted him, for good or bad. From a personal standpoint, my parents fostered a lot of kids when I was growing up. We took them until they were 18 and made them a part of our family...if they wanted to stay after 18, there were ground rules, but they were allowed. For better or for worse, these are still my siblings. One of those kids was taken out of foster care and adopted into a family because they thought he was a ""cute kid"". He was so incredibly excited to have a family. The adoptive parents ignored everything that my parents had to say about the behavioral issues and the mental health issues. They kept him for a couple of years, treated him like crap, and then when the behavior issues surfaced, they returned him. It created so many additional issues for him and he ended up in a really bad place in his life as a result. Thankfully, he has been able to turn his life around and is doing well now, but he still deals with various abandonment issues. This is a child that you are talking about. He's helpless and he's been abandoned and likely had a very difficult first three years of his life. You moved him into an unfamiliar country with an unfamiliar culture. His behaviors are difficult to deal with (I know RAD and I know how tough it can be), but underneath that is a human child who looks to you for all of his basic needs. You are a parent OP, and as hard as being a parent is, you will be able to do this. Find a way to love this child. He needs it."
4,a3vjz3,t2_o6s5nlg,NotAQuiltnB,YTA As a retired law enforcement officer I came in contact with a teacher who adopted a child from Russia. The child was adopted by her and her husband as a toddler. He had serious issues as your boy does. She was committed to him and stood by him. Her husband bailed. She dug in her heels and stood bye that child getting all the professional help her salary could buy. I saw that poor lady age and become broken. Finally at 13 she had been physically attacked more times than I can count. She surrendered the child to the state. He broke her down I cannot express to you how much damage was done to this woman and in the end the child was not saved. Remember the directions they give you on the airplane. Put your oxygen mask on first then the person your helping. Normally I would say die for your child but in this case I am afraid it would be all for naught. Get out while you can and forgive yourself for it. Forget anyone who judges you for it as they cannot walk in your shoes. Bless you. 
4,a3vjz3,t2_1345ci,GeishaB,"NTA. That child is a legit psychopath. I don't know about giving him back, but if he isn't put somewhere secure where he can't hurt people, he *will* escalate his violence. Unfortunately, as a caregiver there is absolutely nothing you can do. He was born that way and if he already has violent tendencies it *will* get worse. You have to understand that he has no empathy, he has a God like complex, he's a world class manipulator, he is not afraid of punishment (he doesn't have the capability), and even has a reduced/delayed response to pain. There is no form punishment that can change him. The worse part is, he believes all of his actions are everyone else's fault. ""Look what you made me do"" He needs to be in a facility that can handle his mental state and will keep people around him safe. You have to be cautious how you handle this because he will most likely end up resenting you and your husband. "
4,a3vjz3,t2_68ltn,Cairnwyn,"NTA. I'd like you to consider that plenty of bio-parents fantasize about giving their children up or never having had them in the first place. Plenty of bio-parents *actually* give their kids up or are so terrible to them / neglectful of them that they have their children taken from their care. And, yes, every parent who thinks this feels like absolute shit, but it is in our nature to escape things that are hurtful to us. This is not a good situation for you, so your instincts are to run. Add to the fact that you probably never properly bonded with your child either, and you're left struggling without any of the happy love hormones that you'd have to help you through if you were bonded from birth. This is quite similar to mothers with extreme PPD. Honestly, having known families in your exact shoes, RAD is the biggest reason I ruled out adoption of an older child. I'm not cut out for it. Most people I know aren't cut out for it. I've watched multiple marriages crumble from dealing with RAD kids. Special needs kids of any type are exhausting. You're giving maximum effort for minimal reward every day of your life. You're grieving the parent-child relationship you always wanted to have, but you don't actually have the time to properly deal with that grief, so you just bottle it up and keep pushing forward because your kid needs you. Desperately needs you. And all you want to do is curl up in bed and cry for an hour then sleep for 3 days. I'm sorry your life didn't turn out the way you envisioned. I'm sorry you didn't get your properly bonded baby. I'm sorry your generous and loving heart led you down a path that's full of pain and sorrow. This sucks. It's unfair. I know everything seems endless and overwhelming, but you can make it through with the right support and resources. Your kid may forever be broken, but you don't have to break with him."

Someone you can be totally open and honest with and mommy blogs arent going to cut it. You need to be talking to a therapist that has, at the very least, a basic understanding of what his condition entails and what you're looking at in the future. Its actually not uncommon for people to not bond with adopted children and vice versa. And people definitely do ""return"" them sometimes. But you've waited quite a long time. I'm sure in adopting someone after 3 years is a lot different than doing it at 6 months or a year. I think you need to talk to someone who really *knows* about what you're asking (and not just anecdotal knowledge, either). Side note, more people should talk about the unsparkly side of adoption. "
4,a3vjz3,t2_88j6b1n,MatterCaster,"NTA I read somewhere that children with this problem will thrive and improve when they are removed from their first adoptive family and placed in another. So this could be the best thing to do for everyone. Also, the adoption agency had to know this child was troubled, and they placed him with you anyway. In a way, you were victimized. You should not feel obligated to cooperate with their con. I have known people who had to do this. It is not as unusual as you may believe. You are a person worthy of care and concern too. Don't let anyone guilt you into keeping this child. Be kind to yourself. "
4,a3vjz3,t2_2if56rqv,Ros1319,"YTA, kinda. Adopting a kid isn’t like adopting a pet. You made a commitment to be a parent, putting him back up for adoption because he has attachment issues is pretty shitty. There are so many other options. More intensive individual therapy, family therapy, and respite care should all be utilized simultaneously, not just individual therapy. You guys should get a family case worker to help navigate treatment plans and treatment needs to be for the whole family. Kids aren’t a commodity. IMO when you choose to become a parent, that’s for life, regardless of how you became a parent. Putting him back up for adoption will only make the attachment disorder worse."

Or you or your husband getting a call that hes murdered one of you. It's been three years, you've given it your all. But you gotta realize that YOU have a life to live. People getting angry at you and saying ""its not like adopting a pet"" are idiots and more than likely hypocrites. If your husband agrees to it, just give him back to the orphanage and never look back. YOU didn't bring him into the world, you have no responsibility to bear this nightmare.

Feeling like this doesn't make you a bad person. You \*would\* be the asshole if you \*actually\* gave him back. Remember this kid is not at fault for having after effects of trauma during a very critical stage of development. He's having a really hard time, and he's not doing it \*at\* you. Are you and your husband seeking training for handling a kid with an attachment disorder, or any kind of respite care for him or therapy for yourselves? People do ""give back"" challenging kids they've had for years. I used to volunteer for an organization that worked to place kids with multiple failed adoptions. I was responsible for organizing their profiles. Let me tell you, watching that progression of photographs with the light dying in their eyes over the years, looking at old biographies where the kids had hope turn into biographies where they don't anymore...it's the most emotionally difficult thing I've ever done. You're a parent. That's not something you can really undo, and it confers a sacred duty. When you adopted this kid, he became your kid, not based on what he would or would not return, but based on your commitment to provide for him. It's possible he'll never show love in the way you'd like, and it's possible he'll never be a success in the way you'd imagined. He is still your kid, and your duty is to do what is best for him. That means not adding another broken attachment to his list, and it means finding whatever extra help you can to keep your own sanity so you can continue to do your best without burning out.

I remember corn syrup was one of the things he couldn’t eat. His doctor thought my sister was nuts when she told him what she suspected but in the end she was right. As long as she avoided those things he reacted to, he was a completely different child. And, when he did have something he shouldn’t, apples seemed to calm him down. I’m only sharing this in hopes that it might help. My nephew has since grown out of it but when he was young and got some of those foods he wasn’t suppose to it made our lives a living hell.

I don't see the sense in ruining both you and your spouse's lives over a child you seem to be making little progress with when you could have a loving relationship with a different child who needs a home just as badly. This may seem a little cold, but let's do the math. Ask yourself how much difference you're making in this child's life, as compare to living in a foster home. This is what's gained by keeping your current adopted son. Now, ask yourself what difference you could make to a (comparatively) psychologically healthy child, who is currently an orphan, and will continue to be without your intervention. Now, replace the stress, fear and shame of having a child who's outwardly violent and hateful towards you and everyone else, with a healthy, loving relationship that you and your husband get to have with a different child. This is what's gained by adopting a different child. Honestly, this seems pretty simple to me. I plan to adopt, not because of infertility, but because I've always wanted to provide that good to the world, to have that impact on a life, and I sure as hell wouldn't stick with a kid I can't have a loving relationship with. I know there's supposed to be difficulties to parenting, but a child who I can't help from attacking me and destroying his room? Fuck. That. I take care of adults with a variety of disabilities, and all of my clients presented challenges to their parents as children. With one client who is pretty severely autistic, his parents had to deal with a similar situation, bolting things down, building a desk that protects his computer from him, padding their walls, getting hit and scratched, constantly replacing his possessions that he chose to break. I've always considered this to be above and beyond.

4,allagl,t2_2ha3va7p,super_kami_guru_93,"I’m going with YTA simply because I don’t have more context on what your girlfriend said. But you voiced your opinion about a car. Your girlfriend then voiced her opinion about that car. There are certainly ways in which she could have voiced that opinion in a bad way. Again, I don’t know what really went down. But her claiming the car is girly is acceptable. Her insinuating that you are girly in some way because you like a girly car is a bad thing. But those two things aren’t the same. It seems to me though that you interpreted her response, warranted or not, as her insinuating that you were girly for liking the car. Seems to me like you got defensive here. Which wouldn’t really do much to fight against that “fragile male ego” stereotype. And from your post it seems like this a repeating pattern of behavior. Additionally, how the hell did a simple comment about a car turn into a serious fight? Your relationship needs some work if that’s the case, from BOTH of you. Lastly, beetles ARE girly cars. It’s fine that you like them, but they are more feminine in their design, marketing, and appeal. You need to toughen up a little bit. Admitting that you over react to issues doesn’t excuse you for over reacting to issues. Honestly makes it worse in my opinion."

Edit: also wanted to add that belittling and berating someone, especially over something so small is not healthy and is pretty toxic. that's not how you treat someone you care for and love. "

I started to be quiet and just kinda lean towards door of the car and turn my head away. She continued to talk about how I always get hurt by things that I have no right to get hurt by and that she isn't gonna apologize for something she didn't do wrong (I never asked her too, I only asked her to be more sensitive sometimes). She continually got more mad at me for saying that I caused the argument and telling me that I always do this. When we got back to her place I eventually left because I didn't want to argue all night long and I could tell it wasn't gonna stop until I told her that I understand all of what she is saying and that she is right. I haven't apologized but she said I had ""the power to fix this but I'm choosing not to."" &#x200B; NTA. This right here is big red flag. Harping that much on something that is clearly not a big deal is not a sign of a healthy relationship. You clearly wanted the conversation to be dropped and it seems to me that you are more offended that she wouldn't let the subject go than actually being offended by her opinion of the car. &#x200B; Also some versions of the Beetle are girly-er than others but I have seen plenty of men driving them."

You may think it’s going to a familiar island but you will never know until you give yourself the chance to cross it. Until then you’re abandoning yourself as well as your cousin (family who has done nothing wrong to you) on either side which may lead to great things and a good freaking bridge if you just get over this fear. Contact your cousin, tell them your concerns, tell them that if you two have a relationship then that will require them to keep your mom out of it, and finally apologize to them. Some of the best/most reliable people in my life are cousins. Hell, she might be going through similar negative experiences through that side of the family as well and is reaching out to someone they know feels the same.

And during this time, while I was scouring the Internet for jobs 8-6 every day, sending out resumes, and occasionally going on interviews: I barely had time to clean for myself, let alone someone else. So it’s perfectly understandable that after a long day of this, she wouldn’t be up for housework! Furthermore, expecting her to commit to being a homemaker when you JUST MOVED IN with her is not reasonable. It is also very dangerous. What happens if you break up? Or you die (God forbid?). What happens to her? She’s screwed! "

I'm going to go with NTA with a tiny bit of YTA in that I think you should have been more assertive (assertive doesn't mean bitchy). Fuck him tho.

But you drew first blood. You called him a pig and demanded shoes. From there he escalated, you threatening to leave if he didn't take off his shoes and not move was too much. So leaving is probably for the best until everyone cools of actually. You both behaved badly and should go to your corners for a bit."

4,ah0a9o,t2_4uil9,xHeero,"YTA. First, a year is long enough of a grieving period to move on and become serious with someone new. Second, she's probably over-nice because she is nervous and really wants to have a good relationship with you. You seem not to like her and resistant to everything about her and your dad's relationship. She probably feels like she is walking on eggshells around you. You have presented ZERO proof that her niceness is a facade. Third....I hate to blow your mind bud, but adults in relationships have sex. If the worst you've found is that they accidentally left a bottle of lube out in their room and that she has lingerie...well my dude...that is nothing. You come across as a kid who can't accept that their parents have split and found different romantic partners."
4,ah0a9o,t2_994jo,thiscouldbemassive,"YTA for treating her badly. You sound very young. Adults in relationships have sex. Your parents did, and now your dad and his girlfriend are. One day you might have sex, too. There's nothing gross about it -- it's part of a healthy relationship. They aren't shoving it in your face. You are going into their room and poking about. So you need to respect their privacy instead of acting like they don't have a right to have a sexual relationship because you exist."
4,ah0a9o,t2_2a2ea23r,germaniumest,"Yes, YTA. I think you're just resentful that your parents have split up and it's odd for you to see him with someone else so now you're looking for reasons to hate this woman who hasn't done anything wrong. You went into their bedroom on your own volition. Bedrooms are usually pretty private rooms where people keep stuff not meant for others to see. Going through laundry - again, you kind of brought this on yourself. Where is she supposed to put her clothes that need to be washed? And what is stripper underwear? You acting like that is extremely childish. It's not her fault your parents divorced and if she makes your dad happy and treats you nicely then that is all that matters. Don't act like a brat."
4,ah0a9o,t2_ohxx8,VivaVeronica,"YTA, but it's understandable to be uncomfortable. How long do you think is the ""right"" amount of time to wait after a divorce? Before you answer, remember to add in all the pre-divorce time he spent miserable. Maybe you also shouldn't root through your dads night table and hamper? Sexy underwear is a thing one wears to show off for a new boyfriend. It's good you're going to talk with him. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask him to put away his lube haha."
4,ah0a9o,t2_25absm1e,boudicas_shield,"YTA. It’s not being “shoved in your face,” either; you’re deliberately snooping around their bedroom and pawing through her laundry. If anyone is gross here, it’s you. Learn some basic boundaries. Man, if anyone came into my bedroom without asking and then whined about seeing my lube on my nightstand, they wouldn’t be invited back into my home. Ditto if I caught them digging through my dirty laundry and inspecting my underwear. Get a grip, OP, and grow up. You’re getting too old to behave this way, and you’d be better off learning that sooner rather than later. "
4,ah0a9o,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,"NTA. It is disgusting. This is one of the many problems with divorce. Instead of parents acting like a parents (as they should) they start acting like teenagers again because they are trying to find a new spouse. In other words, they tend to de-prioritize their children and prioritize finding a new partner. There are only so many hours in the day, and new relationships consume a massive amount of time and resources. Being a parent tends to fall to the bottom of the priority list. This is one of the many reasons I would never get remarried if something happened to my wife. Also, I think you hit the nail on the head. Many stepmothers will act fake nice to the kids in the dating phase, then flip over to who they really are after the marriage occurs. I’ve seen it happen over and over and over. "
4,b52pbc,t2_3elqnuh7,stellalunawitchbaby,"Maybe a little hypocritical. I’d probably have just let the librarian deal with it, or tried to hold my cool, because it sorta negates your purpose if all of a sudden you’re the one yelling and cussing in a library. NTA...but not the best decision. "

4,ag4os8,t2_12tjk69h,patm28,"NTA I’d they’re thinking it is ok for having you sleep on the couch. That being said, you’d probably be responsible for a bit more of the lodging, ie if they have a 7 bedroom, the others couples would split the cost of the room, while you would be responsible for your room. No different than if you all got your own hotel rooms. The other costs should be split equally. That’s just my opinion, "
4,ag4os8,t2_1lvc81je,P_Flange,"NTA. You're paying more than your share AND you're the one that misses out on a bed? I don't think so, and if your friends think that's a fair deal then I have to question how they view the friendship, to be honest. The holiday sounds badly planned if I'm being brutally honest. Each person should be paying the same amount, and the location should be able to accommodate the needs of each person attending. As this is not happening in either sense, the location chosen is unsuitable for purpose. You guys are trying to smash a square peg into a round hole and wondering why it isn't working."
4,ag4os8,t2_19bwl3eq,CrescentDarling,NTA but you need to deal with this issue reasonably. If you're not getting a bedroom too then you should be paying less. From what you said there are other paying less money than you. They should be the ones getting the sofa. Its a mistake of you to offer to pay more when you already know your getting less. Tell them that payment should be equal to what your getting and if they object then don't go.
4,ag4os8,t2_15c00l,penelope_pig,"NTA. Our friend group does a yearly long weekend trip. We always make sure there are enough bed for everyone (sometimes two singles will have to bunk in the same room, but they each have their own bed for sure), and everyone pays the same price (no discount for being a couple). There's no way you should be paying the same price (or more) than everyone else and not at least getting a bed to sleep in. Your friends are assholes if they think that's okay."
4,ag4os8,t2_1xii9vu2,ForeverBlue3,"NTA Couples should be paying the same price per person as single people. That is pretty crappy that he is paying way more already due to just being the only single guy as well as paying extra because some of the friends are on a budget. I'd say they need to suck it up and find a place that is big enough for everyone going to have their own bed. If nobody else is willing to sleep on the floor or a couch, why would they think that OP should have to? Either this or the people who are paying less should sleep on the floor on an air mattress. That makes the most sense since they're paying the least amount. Easiest solution OP, is find yourself a date for the weekend :)"
4,ag4os8,t2_bhqjh,Zenai10,If you're paying for the difference and the others are okay with how they are sleeping then NTA. however if you were not then i totally understand them not wanting to pay for you. I cant really comment properly not knowing the cabins. But if you dont get your own bed what exactly would you be paying for? Surely if you wanted a bed its a simple matter of you paying for your bed and the others paying for theirs. As someone who was on the couple side of this situation hsving to pay an extra 200 on top of what im paying for myself was crazy. But i was only told as we arrived.
4,b9qtbv,t2_3jh4d0fr,buddingredditor,"NTA. At all. Just because someone is family, doesn't mean you owe them anything. But that being said - do YOU want to help him out? There's 2 options - you can be the bigger and better person and help him out and your good karma (life karma not Reddit karma ha) will pay you back when you least expect it... OR you can tell him to get fucked and sort it himself to give him a taste of his own medicine. If his soon to be Ex Wife is as manipulative as you convey, he may not have realised how much of a dickhead he was when you needed him and probably had everything twisted by her. Both balls and brain. And that's something you don't realise until you're out of the situation. Ultimately, it's upto you, but either way, I personally say you wouldn't be TA. "

That said, his wife could have done a lot to mess with his mind to turn him against you. This could be an opportunity for you to rebuild your relationship with your brother. That he may have been manipulated does not diminish the harm he did to you, or your feelings on the matter. Being manipulated does not absolve him of the harm he has done or his actions during it, its an explanation, not a justification. In the end, this is an opportunity to rebuild something with your brother. Like all opportunities, you can take it or you can leave it, and neither decision would make you an asshole."

However, maybe you can use this time to instead be the bigger man and help him out. He obviously fucked up a lot in the past, but maybe this can be an opportunity for you to reconcile your relationship with your brother. I'm not defending him for how he treated you, but it sounds like he was pretty blinded and manipulate by his wife.

4,b9qtbv,t2_1642om,Cassereddit,"NTA, but family should stick together as long as possible imo. It's your chance to be the bigger man and mend your relationship if you are ready to move on from the past. But it's totally understandable if you don't anything to do with him anymore.

4,b9qtbv,t2_bq5e51t,NefariousNebula,"NTA I get the impression that his ex was abusive. ""Filling his mind with lies"" about you to keep you two distant and gaslighting him throughout the affair (which may have actually lasted these two years) are clear flags of abusive behavior. First thing to do is to talk to your wife. I completely understand why she wouldn't want to help, but maybe you should remind her how important he was in your life once, and if you honestly want to help him escape this poisonous relationship, maybe it would be good for everyone. &#x200B; If she agrees, only offer assistance where it's not going to put you out, like storing his stuff in an unused corner of the garage or helping him look for apartments, but also, see if you can take time to hang out just the two of you. Grab a burger together somewhere and just let him talk. Hopefully he will eventually realize that he was in an abusive relationship and work to become a better person, and brother. Or he might just become a selfish bitch that you eventually need to sever all ties with, but the former is more likely. Good luck! &#x200B;"
4,b9qtbv,t2_1b1torqv,Spider4Hire,"NTA - you can't use ""it is family"" as an excuse to help especially when he didn't follow that concept. On a familiar note, I no longer talk to my brother because his then fiancee filled his head with lies and lashed out on me one day in a way that you can't take back. He obviously had remorse when he found her cheating on him. I cannot accept an apology (5 years ago) from him and stay cordual during family gatherings. He chose to believe someone over someone who he knew for over 20 years, inside and out. I also want to add on that I got married at 20 (by only a month) and still happily married 7 years later. Don't put an age to making ""stupid"" decisions. Everyone makes their stupidest decisions, and their best decisions, at any given age."
4,b9qtbv,t2_a6k64,little_mermarx,"NTA -- At the end of the day, nobody wants to believe their spouse is cheating (sunk cost fallacy and all that business) so in that context, having you drunkenly send texts calling his wife a cheating cunt would probably warrant no contact. I think that's the risk anybody takes when confronting somebody with a harsh reality that they are unwilling to face. Buuuuut she was a cheating cunt and you were just trying to help out your bro. He knows he fucked up your relationship, but it's not your job to try to fix it. You aren't an asshole for not responding, but maybe give it time and consider what long term reconciliation would even look like to you before you try to talk to him, if at all. That way you give him at least the opportunity to make amends but he's not putting it on you, which is what his attempt to contact you kind of feels like."
4,b9qtbv,t2_x6cdp1k,SquirrelGirlVA,"NAH. Your brother was a moron. He's *just* now starting to realize how much of a fool he really was and how awful and toxic his wife actually is/was. That he apologized to you is actually a fairly good sign, as it shows that he realizes that he was an idiot. I don't think that many would blame you for not responding, however keep in mind that he's the only blood family you have and that once, before his terrible wife, you two were close. I don't think that you can ever really get back to where you were before, but I'd like to believe that you two could get to the point where you're in contact with one another. I'd give him a small chance here - I wouldn't help him financially, but I would throw him a small lifeline and just talk to him. I'm just afraid of you both regretting all of this later and then letting years keep you from reconnecting even after the worst of the pain is mostly gone. "
4,b9qtbv,t2_hcokh,limpingpigeon,"NTA. Your brother is the one that burned the bridge, and it's completely reasonable of you feel like you can't be his support now as a result. That said, it doesn't sound like you've entirely made up your mind and that's okay, too. Take time to decide what, if anything, you want from a relationship with your brother and move forward according to that. While it may very well be that much of his behavior stemmed from his manipulative (and if she was deliberately sabotaging his connections with others, most likely abusive) partner and he is now seeing that, it doesn't obligate you to invest in reforging that connection. "

Were they wandering around your house looking for a bathroom when they discovered a room where you kept your Confederacy memorabilia? I have to imagine if I was in that situation, I'd probably start figuring out ways to get out of there. I wouldn't go the violent route, though. At most, I would probably get in an argument about it and leave. In reality, I would probably just make an excuse and go hang out with somebody else I didn't now suspect of being a closet racist. Congrats on writing an AITA about a Confederate flag where you come out looking alright, though. Even if you are probably not including the full story or are leaving out some key details. I've gotta say, you embellish your story with lots of talk about how important this flag is to your family and how it doesn't have any ties to white supremacy, but it still reads to me like your grandpa and uncle were both a couple of Confederates. The 'family history' line never really makes sense to me. I've got Nazis in my family tree's history, but I would never be particularly interested in hanging up a Hitler Youth uniform in my office."

There is a right way and a wrong way to make your feeling known about the confederate flag, and this was not the way to go. Demanding she be criminally charged is a bit much, but I get it since your wife was injured. As far as a civil case, I would see about trying to just quietly settle this with her lawyer. I say that there is a side of ESH because you really have your head in the sand if you don’t understand why a person would not view your flag with a positive or neutral light. You may think there is nothing wrong with it because your relatives carried it in WW2 and the Vietnam War, but a person in your home that stumbles upon it while looking for the restroom is not going to know that or see it that way. They see your big flag in a prominent place (it was immediately noticed when she opened the door) in an expensive antique frame. From a third person viewpoint, it looks like you are glorifying the confederacy. In the future, you may want to seriously consider locking your office when having company over or take the flag down and put it away when guests are over. Frankly, if I had walked into your office and saw that, I would have not freaked like she did or made a scene, but I certainly would have thought some not great things about you and would want to have very little to do with your wife and family after. "
4,b3s2dk,t2_38eujj21,ageralds1,"NTA- woah, there are lines and she crossed it many times over. I know the flag is gross, but you had it in a frame small enough for one woman to hold, so likely folded respectfully. It represents war hero’s in your family. IT WAS IN YOUR PRIVATE OFFICE. You weren’t flying it and carrying a tiki torch here. that is just terrible"
4,b3s2dk,t2_13l4ik,Deadly9750,NTA. This woman came into your home in your private office and destroyed something with a lot of sentimental family history to it. You should absolutely press charges to the fullest extent the law allows. She clearly cannot respect boundaries and you are in no way wrong in this situation. If you cannot accept the consequences to your actions then she shouldn't have destroyed your property. 
4,b3s2dk,t2_34fbpsyi,DRCsyntax,"NTA - She's completely out of fucking line. People like this infuriate me beyond belief. It's a damn flag, an inanimate object, get the hell past it. &#x200B; I'm black/mexican in Texas and hate seeing news reports about ""Confederate monument being removed from blah blah"" Why?! What the fuck for? So, we're just going to ignore the Civil War occurred? We're going to hide it? Why? &#x200B; Anyway, not trying to derail, I'm just tired of people riding on the curtails of their ancestors, who would more likely want them to remember that kind thing instead of try to damn and curse it. (Because it's a clear sign of how far we've come as a people....not just a reminder of how low we were.)"
4,b3s2dk,t2_2ljykv,kingtutwashere,"NTA if the story you tell is true. While I can see how someone whose ancestors were literally enslaved under that flag having an adverse reaction to seeing one, I can admit going through your house, damaging property, and injuring your wife is an asshole move. However, to me you come across as a little bit of an asshole in the post for trying to pretend that the flag itself has no ties to racism. It kind of feels like your implying its an asshole move to have negative feelings towards that particular flag in general. The confederacy were traitors to the United States who killed US soldiers on American soil and wanted to keep human beings as property. Using/creating the confederate flag as their chosen symbol to stand behind. Just because your uncle and grandfather were good guys to you doesn't suddenly remove the legacy or symbolism of the flag. If you hang a flag that was hung during the enslavement and torture of an entire race be prepared for people to think you're kind of an asshole when they see it on the wall. Though you shouldn't have to prepare for property being smashed or wife's foot getting cut. "
4,b3s2dk,t2_munzn,GbMaxSE,"NTA - This woman's behavior was WILDLY inappropriate. To just go anywhere she wants in someone's home isn't acceptable... Let's say we buy her bullshit story of ""I went in there by accident""... Ok, fine. But what gave her the right to remove the flag from where it was stored? Nothing. Nothing did. That was completely inappropriate. And then to make it about her and smash a family heirloom? WHOA. Nutjob behavior. Listen to some extent I'm with her. Regardless of why you have it, the fact of the matter is that the confederate flag is inflammatory. And it's a flag with a very rough history, and it shouldn't be displayed in public anymore. But we are talking about something in YOUR private home, where you can do more or less whatever you want with home decorations. The woman was WAY out of line. "
4,b3s2dk,t2_4go1hyy,BrownEyedQueen1982,"NTA: This was your private home. You can display whatever you want where you want to. This person had no business in your office (if she needed to use the restroom she could have asked). You did not over react in any way. This person was in a private area in your home that she had no purpose being in. This person touched something that did not belong to her. This person damaged an irreplaceable heirloom and injured your pregnant wife in the process. You were within your rights to have her arrested and charged. As for her career if you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes."
4,b3s2dk,t2_pijkjv6,djternan,NTA You're not flying it from the back of some shitty lifted truck. You had it in your private office where she had no business being. It's a historical piece and has some sentimental value since your family members carried it into war. She deserved to be arrested and good luck getting all you can in the civil suit.
4,b3s2dk,t2_33whh3kb,_922_,"NTA even though i dont agree with you having it in your home (history or not, it's a racist emblem) she has no right to snoop through your house and break your stuff. HOWEVER! >Long story short- cops were called, she was arrested, and charges will be filed. I have also retained a lawyer to go after her in civil court. As she works in the healthcare field, I am told a criminal record will be quite damaging to her career though it won't end it entirely. this feels like massive overkill. you're going to potentially damage someone's career and give her a criminal record over a tantrum? YWBTA if you follow through on this."
4,b3s2dk,t2_aj5h0,Shortandsweet33,"NTA. And while the guest is clearly an asshole and deserves everything that’s coming to her, including career consequences, you wife’s friend is also an asshole. Her “apology” to you was fake and disingenuous as shit. She apologised for her friend’s behaviour and offered to pay but then *said you were overreacting* (you were not) *tried to guilt you over “ruining a young woman’s life”* (she’s and adult and responsible for her own actions, if anyone “ruined her life” it was her) and * told you you shouldn’t have had the flag in your home at all*. That was not an apology, that was a masterclass in gaslighting. Pursue the flag-thrower for all she’s worth, both criminally and civilly. And reconsider your friendship with the woman who “apologised” under he guise of guilt-tripping you for something that was 0% your fault. "
4,b3s2dk,t2_11igcq,apathyontheeast,"NTA, but if you're going to have it on display where it's possible people will see it (even ""accidentally"" in a home office), you have to understand that people are going to have a reaction to it...though her reaction was WAY out of line. And its sounds like she will justly be paying for it. So you're NTA, but that doesn't mean I think you're making a smart decision. I want to say, I do sympathize with you, OP. My family has an heirloom rifle from the early 1900's or so with a swastika on it that was a gift to my family, as my great-great-uncle was one of the first Yellowstone Park guardians/wardens/custodians/whatnot - and I definitely think people would freak if they saw it without knowing it predates Nazi Germany by several decades. >They do not have any ties to white supremacy nor did they hold any racist views I don't totally know that I agree with this bit, though...but that's aside to the actual situation. "
4,b3s2dk,t2_ukzta24,propschick05,"NTA- I haven't read any comments because I feel like you explained the situation clearly. It was in a private area of the house behind a closed door, not a main area. The guest made a scene over it and damaged private property. I'm not a proponent of the Confederate flag at all, but you seem to have legitimate reasons. Maybe just take it down any time you are having people over that you don't know well to be safe. As far as filing the civil suit, won't the arrest that day show in her records anyway? Has she shown any remorse or offered to cover the costs? Was she drunk? "
4,b3s2dk,t2_153h8o,craigus17,"NTA. It’s a bit tricky, I mean yes it’s a family heirloom but WHY is it a family heirloom? Seems a bit dangerously close to you keeping a memento to the fact that your ancestors were racists. You may not be racist yourself but by keeping it you are arguably indirectly supporting your ancestors’ views. Although I suppose the counter argument is that acknowledging is not the same as celebrating. It’s a tricky subject, BUT it’s one that shouldn’t have come up since it was in your private room, which is what made me settle on NTA."
4,b3s2dk,t2_2a2we1ds,KevinMMahon,"NTA. I hate confederate flags and all they stand for, but you weren't using it in correlation with any symbology, it is merely an heirloom of your family that has been passed down as something taken into wars for this country. It was in your own private quarters, and not only did she damage it in a way that costs money to repair/replace, but she injured your wife and made a scene that ruined a perfectly good and innocent party just because she found something harmless in a place she shouldn't have been."
4,a86kbb,t2_2befghee,NickTheTuba,"NTA. Your mom showed her true colors when she said she doesn’t support you. While it is generally good to forgive people and accept their apologies, I can definitely understand why you’re mad. Ultimately, it just comes down to your mom having a bad parenting moment. All parents have them (some more than others) and often times, they’re not conscious decisions, but just things that they do because of how they were raised or what their life has been like. This definitely looks like a bad parenting moment, but the fact that your parents are waiting for you to accept the apology means that it’s not just a moment, is an ongoing issue. If it were me, tbh I would stay mad. Don’t accept the apology. Try to talk to them and explore the deeper issues at hand."
4,b37qkk,t2_icgzt,LordJiraiya,"NTA, you let your preferences be known far in advance and you found a compromise so that you both can enjoy things together (the borderline shows). She already knew that you wouldn't want to see that specific genre of film but she asked you anyway, and then is upset for you asking so you would know that you don't want to go? This makes no sense to me, she should go see it with someone else or by herself if she wants to go that bad."
4,a82jrn,t2_12c7jd,elinordash,"NTA, but you need to get the hell out of this situation. Confident people know what they want out of a relationship and they don't settle for less. And honestly, if you'd said you needed commitment when the issue first came up there is like a 20% chance he would have gone for it. Now you're the desperate girl who will put up with whatever he wants and it is even less likely he'll ever want to be your boyfriend. "
4,a82jrn,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,"NAH. No one buys the cow when they’re getting the milk for free. Why would he? He’s getting precisely what he wants, on demand and with zero commitment. So here’s the more important piece...what to do about it. He’s using you and has no reason to stop and no intention of stopping. The idea that if you stick around, maybe he will come around, is unlikely to pan out. It might. He’d have to catch feelings. I wouldn’t bet on it. The other strategy is the one I would go with. Cut him off and go no contact. I wouldn’t stay friends. If you do, he’s likely to tell you what you want to hear, and as soon as he gets back in your pants he’ll revert right back to where he is right now. Going no contact would really be for you. It will help you break away and learn to fly on your own again. Its better that you end it. Secondary to that, he may miss you and be more open to a real relationship. He may not, and go searching for another girl similar to you that he can use with no strings. Either way, you regain your independence. I don’t think this is going to end well with the relationship in its current state, so you’ve really got nothing to lose. "
4,avjyev,t2_33g8kiu4,datboy123456789,"NTA I’d understand the other woman if the seats were almost entirely filled, but if there were other seats perfectly empty and the place you were sat wasn’t particularly close to any gate then it’s just the other woman being petty herself, unnecessarily "
4,9y7kwo,t2_26wqxw2t,lifetimemoviewatcher,"You are looking at this all wrong. The only reasons you want to stay are friends, societies and things being cheaper? Really? You want to leave because, among other things, you were poorly welcomed? Your abroad. Your there this study. This can be a fantastic opportunity for academic enrichment and resume enrichment. You get to explore a new country and culture. And of course you should meet wonderful people. I think your parents are right in not wanting you to leave. You are just looking for excesses to do it as evidenced by your list. You are facing inconveniences. Than solve them. Get help if needed to do that. Abandoning this opportunity that you have been given would be terrible. Look at the bigger picture. You would be the asshole if you left particularly if your parents are supporting your education abroad with their hard earned money."
4,aejroo,t2_bybl2,atrueamateur,"YTA. No matter the tone you used, you are forbidding her from going on a trip *your parents* invited her on. A trip that will involve your mother going on a plane and through a crowded city and encountering thousands of people, many of whom probably carry airborne-spreadable illnesses, which is a risk she apparently takes no issue with. You don't even know if what your girlfriend has is contagious. You should have talked to your parents first before laying down the law with your sick girlfriend. EDIT: For the record, my mother has RA. She's travelled with me or my sister sick all the time and just uses sensible good hygiene practices to protect herself. It's not like your mom is waiting for someone to breathe on her wrong and she'll collapse dead."
4,aejroo,t2_11uqt6,cartmanbruh99,"YTA, the way you said it and not even offering up solutions or compromises. Such as your mum wearing a mask over her mouth, which she should probably do regardless of your gf. Your travelling to a hugely populated area I doubt your girlfriend is going to be the cause of illness. "
4,aejroo,t2_4ulh6,jennerality,"YTA - of course you're not wrong in letting her know but obviously if the delivery was ""kinda harsh"" (and if you think it was ""kinda harsh"" I'm gonna guess it was just harsh) there is no need for that. Sounds like she said she understood but of course she's going to be disappointed since she was excited and also feeling like shit since she has such a high fever. Also, not exactly sure what the purpose of continuing to rant after she agreed... did you want or expect her reaction to be happy and chipper? Sometimes situations just suck and it's no one's fault; doesn't mean you can't be sad about it. She's the one who is feeling ill and also now likely can't go on a trip she was looking forward to so some empathy and comfort would be expected here."
4,aejroo,t2_2sju1483,WandofMagicMissile,"Nta but maybe ESH? It sounds like your mom is using medication to treat her condition and THAT is causing the immune compromization. Idk how the condition itself is causing that I have similar medication but it really only makes you higher risk for severe illnesses, not the common cold. It just makes it easier for TB to take hold. I even work in medicine, interacting safely with Flu and C diff patients. You kinda over reacted but your mom may be a germaphobe after hearing the small side effects. At first I wouldnt want to do specific parts of my job but I was just paranoid and overthinking it. > It's new york city at a play...your mom is going to be exposed to much worse. Cant you literally keep them separated? I would try to make this work but I hate being away from my wife. It doesnt sound like you all are in the same hotel room Idk your mother she could get ill easily, I have similar medication but I am an athlete in my mid 20s."
4,aejroo,t2_2md0v7ll,ThatNewSockFeel,"YTA, but from the right place. It's commendable to try and keep your mother from getting sick but on the other hand she's about to get on a plane and travel to NYC. Both places filled with germs and opportunities to get sick. As long as your girlfriend isn't coughing and sneezing all over your mom and promises to be as careful as possible I don't know if it's fair to say she can't come just for that reason. If your mom is taking precautions against getting sick in those places I don't think your girlfriend (who will presumably be on the mend) is going to pose much additional risk."
4,aejroo,t2_x6cdp1k,SquirrelGirlVA,"NTA. NTA. NTA. It's not like you were making a flippant decision. You could've been nicer, but if she wasn't getting the point that this could make your mom incredibly sick then some harsh wording would be in order. It's not like you were doing it because you're a germaphobe or anything, but because this could really fuck up your mom's health. My grandparents had several points in their later lives where they were immuno-compromised because of various health issues. There were times that we flat out told relatives (especially those with children) not to come over because they had a cold they could catch. When I lived with them I would honestly sequester myself if I ever got sick, because I didn't want to pass it on to them. I don't think a lot of people realize how bad something can get with people whose immune system is compromised. It's not like someone passing on a cold to a person with a normal immune system, as a simple cold can turn into a hospital stay and even a life threatening issue. "
4,a1rpn7,t2_pcitxcd,Wikidess,"NTA but be warned >I want the extra responsibility but not without the title and pay that goes with it. I know many people who've missed out on a promotion for having that sort of attitude. At my current job, I was asked to train to be the backup for another (higher) position. This came with a lot more responsibility but no pay raise. I was her backup for a year, and then she was promoted, leaving her position empty. Which I filled, receiving a hefty raise. Now there were a few people who had been there longer and felt like that promotion should have been theirs - but they didn't want the extra responsibility without the pay. Since I had spent a year as her backup, I was the logical choice to replace her. For me, the money I'm making now is well worth the year of extra work and no raise =) "
4,a1rpn7,t2_y6gk1,TheSpanishKarmada,"NTA I don't understand why they can't pay you a managers salary for the time that you're performing managers duties? Once the other guy comes back they can bump you back down. Never feel guilty for standing up for yourself at work though, most companies will cut you without second thought if it helps their bottom line"
4,adrfp7,t2_wqks4tb,finianden,"YTA, but that’s because you’re probably a teenager. I spent a lot of time traveling internationally with my family, having similar fights with my brother and then subsequently with my parents, and now when I remember them I cringe. Now that I’m an adult I appreciate SO much that they worked so hard so my brother and I could have these incredible experiences few others got to have. But it took me growing up and working and understanding things more to get to this point. Cut your dad some slack, I read that he’s also working while you’re there, so he’s probably pretty stressed with it all. Take a second and let him you appreciate him working hard for you guys, it’ll go a long way for him. "
4,apxa03,t2_10uwve,MrFluffPants1349,"YTA-ish? I mean, she asked and you gave her an honest response. Sure, you could have been more tactful, but considering you were 15 it's understandable that you weren't. She probably has that condition where you sweat constantly and it smells bad. I went to school with a kid like that, and unfortunately most kids don't realize it's not as easy as just wearing deoderant and showering regularly. Maybe your telling her that helped her realize the issue, as we tend to get used to our own smells. "
4,apxa03,t2_e6w6r,Squiggy226,"NTA but you could have been way more delicate in how you handled it. Maybe ""Let's take a walk. I don't know if it's a body chemistry thing or you have pets at home but sometimes you have an odor that's noticeable. You're a great person and I like you a lot but I've noticed it and other people have too. Sorry if this is embarrassing but it's something that you can definitely take care of now that you know about it."""
4,apxa03,t2_dii8k,ElectricFleshlight,"NTA. You were young, so it was a learning experience. When you need to say something potentially embarrassing, it's best to do so in private. You told her she stinks in front of a group, which was humiliating for her. Yes, they all knew she stinks too, but it doesn't make it less embarrassing. When Robin asked if you know why, you should have taken her aside and quietly told her where the others couldn't hear. Honestly, you'd known she has body odor problems for a while, so it would have been best to say something privately long beforehand. That's part of friendship, being respectfully honest with each other. "
4,apxa03,t2_2bv761lj,bryanaguilar2773,NTA It was brave of you not to beat around the bush. Everyone keeps saying you could have been more delicate. How do you tell someone they smell like cat urine delicately. You can't. You did the right thing. And honestly probably improved her life over all. Because she is now aware of it. It may have hurt at first. But hard truths usually do. I would want someone to tell me if the roles were reversed
4,b19cac,t2_22rvvykj,rosy--dead,"INFO - was it the middle of the day or at night? Either way, NTA. Keep managing your PTSD. It's not an excuse to freak out at people, but you know that. Also littering is bad. Honestly this post kinda makes me mad on your behalf. I don't want people I don't know touching my car. I don't want to deal with random flyers for shit I don't care about. Plus - the way he started walking toward you again and was staring at you seems intensely creepy to me. edit: also, are you a woman? younger? It shouldn't matter, but I think it does. I'm a 21 year old woman and if something like this happened to me I would be really freaked out. I don't know if I'd react the same way but I think feeling scared/vulnerable justifies your reaction a little more."
4,b19cac,t2_3arsusyn,MaxScar-,"YTA: But you stated you have PTSD. This still is your responsibility as part of society to get treatment for it so your basically not terrorizing small business owners who are only trying to get their business started up. And he went back to pick up the flyer because im sure he paid out of his pocket for them, and it was expensive for him to do. Now how would you feel if you were promoting your dream business and some crazy person yells at you for seemingly no reason? Then throws your hard earned money on the ground.... "

You’ve gone above and beyond for both of them, but you need to do what’s right for your growing family. I would, however, get it in writing with a third party witness that your mom is relinquishing ownership of the dog to you before you rehome it.

4,axfrqy,t2_1kugvbm,loverink,"YTA \- You picked your seat in advance knowing the one beside it was taken. You chose it \*planning\* to ask them to switch rather than accepting your fate or choosing first class (if available). \- You complained that you paid extra for your seat... which means SO DID HE. \- You asked once, fine. But asking politely does not entitle you to getting your way. He said no and you badgered him again! I'd have put on headphones too. \- You're aghast at his behavior, but he was not the one requesting special treatment. Give him the benefit of the doubt too -- maybe he gets anxious flying and chose the exit seat due to fear. \- I get that plane rides are uncomfortable when you're taller. That said a LOT of people are 6 ft tall. Meaning there were likely other people on the plane who didn't make a scene. You tell the story as if you're a 7 ft giantess. &#x200B; &#x200B;"

He wasn't ""mean and vindictive"" and he didn't treat you like shit, and certainly not because you're tall and he's short. He was annoyed (and rightly so) because he chose his seat, turned down your request to switch, and you persisted. You paid for the seat you had. He paid for the seat he had.

4,an6sao,t2_udmac,Hunterofshadows,"NTA Considering she is bi she should be a hell of a lot more understanding than she is being. It’s hard to believe someone who is bi can be that dense. You aren’t bi just because you’ve been with a guy in the past. Lots of lesbians have been with guys once or twice because figuring out your identity is hard. Edit: that being said, have you specially told her before that you identify as lesbian and not bi? Or is this the first that this has actually come out? If it’s the latter, I’d say NAH "
4,an6sao,t2_2h3dn4up,pwell77,NTA - have you talked to her about it lots? How daring those guys hurt you. Maybe have a long discussion and ask if she considers other gay people and how they sometimes would marry people of the opposite sex to hide it etc. and how that doesn’t make them bi? If she can’t respect that and it’s something important to you to identify with then she might not be mature enough for you and clearly doesn’t respect you feelings on it. Also her comment on going full gay or whatever it was is very immature. I’m bi and don’t consider myself straight when dating men and lesbian when dating women. Still bi. 
4,an6sao,t2_1405k6,baepsaemv,NTA. Who is she to tell you how to identify? You have a really common lesbian experience and it’s beyond insulting for anyone to tell a lesbian that they need to accept being ‘sexually fluid’ just because they have a past with men.
4,an6sao,t2_a7rap,MadtownMaven,"YTA - When you talk about being with men as being a shameful thing, your gf hears that she done something shameful. That may not be your intention, but that is what you are arguing comes across as. It does sound biphobic. Rather than focus on that you should have a follow up discussion with her when you've both calmed down about how while you were with guys in the past, it was done out of confusion and not something you're happy reliving. That you now identify as a lesbian and you need her to respect that now. You're fine if she's happy talking about her past relationships, but that talking about your past male partners really puts you in a negative space and that you'd hope she'd want to help you avoid that by not mentioning it again or with others. "
4,b2cjwn,t2_11k4x8,notashroom,"NTA. SILITA. You and your wife really should come to an agreement on this, rather than you just dictating how it goes and her trying to make up for what she apparently sees as your share of the work as a couple. You get to have boundaries (and should) but you could have handled this better. Your SIL is an ass for repeatedly pulling this stunt, but all of you have enabled her in this and apparently no one has made any significant effort to rein her in. And it seems the rest of the family has no problem with being her unpaid servants while she plays queen for a day. For her next birthday, maybe your wife or some other family member can help SIL plan the party ahead of time so that the work can be split over time and help can be hired if needed. Otherwise, you and your wife just do whatever you've agreed to do as a couple ahead of time (after cooling down from this one).

Even their daughter is not entitled to help with expense without conditions. You're entitled to your opinion and live your life how you want but not to force others to facilitate it.

You don't see the big deal in your behavior because you think you're right. Do you care if staying there and forcing them to kick you out repeatedly ultimately does drive a wedge between them? Do you care if she ends up in debt or quitting school to pay bills so she can live with you after they fight it out?

You had previously communicated your needs to her multiple times, and rather than addressing them and discussing ways to compromise, she ignored you and continued doing what she felt like doing. Guess she thought she could get away with it forever. Sounds like she's had her ears opened now? I dunno the solution, though, beyond compromises that might seem petty or awkward now but might be your only hope as you two are on complete opposite ends of the video watching spectrum. The (unrealistic?) cure is to get your faces out of those screens, get off your kiesters, and become active as a couple, of course. Otherwise, you could alternate days or shows. Movies that are strongly your preference are to be watched your way, and vice versa, with the option for the less interested partner to choose to do a completely different activity with no pouting from either party. That sort of thing. Less invested daily viewings could be watched with less than 100% consideration; she agrees to scale back her interruptions but not stop totally, and you agree to respond to a few chats per hour and let her know when you're going to tune her out to enjoy the rest of the show?

Just because they shower together doesn't mean they're having sex. They could be but maybe they just enjoy taking a shower to start their morning together. Someone else has also probably jacked off in there multiple times, and the previous tenants also probably did things there to. Are they leaving behind a mess? No? Then as long as there is no issues with schedules no one should care. As for him buying his own things maybe he has a preference or his girl does. If he's not using the communal stuff he shouldn't be forced to buy it. He may also be planning on moving out at some point so buying his own appliances isn't weird. Leaving his girlfriend home at the house every day while he is gone is kinda tricky. She isn't on the lease and most places have a rule on how long guest can stay. Have a chat about it, if you guys don't feel comfortable maybe talk to him about it. Also asking for a lock to be on your door is not paranoia. He just wants a way to make sure his room is safe.

Why is a couple having sex in a shower any more gross than three dudes sharing one for years?

But it's hard to not worry about it because I'm sure that you have anxiety, as the two go hand-in hand. So keep the financial discussion open with Mike. Once per month, ask him how he is feeling and if he wants you to start financially contributing. And tell him that you're going to keep asking him once a month - and actually do it.

If he had enforced this with all his clients, that would make more sense. It seems like he is taking his annoyance of you canceling out on you in an unprofessional manner.

They probably want to connect to you emotionally, and the fact that you look down on your ""less successful"" siblings and resent the fact that your parents can connect with them makes your whole family even further alienated. I know that this is what you struggle with, and I really hope you can find some resolution and peace for yourself.

Otherwise, she's just a lay that you could get elsewhere. Even if you thought she was the one, the correct time to date her best friend is after your ex has met someone and they are official. Even then, feelings may be hurt, but at least she will be in a relationship so anything she says about being hurt or jealous will be a direct insult against her current significant other. As a result, she'd probably just shut the fuck up and you'd be free to date her bestie. Personally, I'd wait like six months after she's met someone or when their facebook status changes."

You could give a part-payment for her feeding him. Like one third of the total amount or something similar.

4,aije30,t2_4rqvh,CreeDorofl,"NTA - ugh, I kinda feel this one because I've been the asshole 23-year old who neglected catboxes. It's so nasty scooping or changing them, but you have to ignore the chore for a while before the cats say ""fuck this"" and start pissing elsewhere. I don't think they do that, if a clean-enough box is available. Still, you're in an awkward spot where it's sort of he-said she-said. To you, the evidence of is clearcut and obvious that she didn't stay over, and didn't scoop/change as often as she should have. And I believe you. But would a judge, if they dragged you into small-claims court? I think that even though they didn't do a good job and even though it's gonna end up costing you money, you might want to throw them a few bucks just so that you put this drama behind you, and avoid the possibility of going to court over it. Just some dollar amount that will prevent this girl's mom from saying ""She made my kid work for a whole week and didn't pay her a dime!"" ...paying nothing at all might seem logical based on the damage you incurred, but I don't think it would hold up legally.

However, the way you are handling it is, to put it frankly, less than stellar. Her moral liability here is precisely whatever her legal liability is, and your appropriate recourse would be to determine what that legal liability is, and what actions you would need to take to hold her accountable for it. It may very well be that she's liable for the cost of damages associated with the urine, but it strikes me as something for a neutral third party (not her mom, lol) to determine rather than the aggrieved, unilaterally.

4,aije30,t2_npcu11l,mathxjunkii,"NAH- I don’t think. I’m wondering if maybe the cat peed because you guys were gone for 7.5 weeks and the cat was angry about that? So maybe the girl cleaned the box adequately but the cat was upset? Cats are temperamental. That being said- when the issue started, she needed to call you or have her mom call you immediately and have you guys make a decision about what to do next (such as boarding the cat) because that’s unacceptable. You noted that the girls mom listed one of her daughters expenses as “gas driving to and from your house”. Ask the mother why that cost is so high if her daughter were suppose to be staying at your house. And ask why no one communicated with you when they noticed that the cat was not using the litter box, despite it being clean (when and if it was). Because cat pee is quite a problem. That’s not like a dog peeing on the rug by the door because he wasn’t let out in time. Cats pee to be vindictive and the smell is potent. I’m wondering if she peed to mark territory because she didn’t like the girl that was house sitting (cats are also choosy about their care takers). "
4,aije30,t2_1e6tmurj,TheCheekyTrollop,"NTA and if I were you, I’d be tempted to tell the mother, since you are her business client, that unless her daughter (or she on the daughter’s behalf) reimburses you for the property damage you’ve suffered (which is worth even more than the 1K you didn’t pay) then you will be taking your custom elsewhere. In all seriousness though, your business relationship with this woman is probably ruined. But her daughter didn’t do the job, so shouldn’t get paid, it’s very simple. She’s lucky you’re not pursuing her for costs for your flooring and potential loss of deposits."
4,aije30,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"NTA If you pay her a dime, you'd be the asshole. She caused you at least a thousand in damage. No pay. She didn't live there, she left that poor cat alone for almost 2 months, and she didn't clean the litter boxes. Paying her would be insane, because she caused damage and left the cat in an unsanitary environment. I can't imagine how horrible it was for him. Alone with urine smell everywhere, and no clean box. Have him checked at the vet as well. Stress and forced habits like this can cause urinary issues in the future. Who knows if he even got fresh water and twice daily food. Don't give her a pass because mommy is upset that her daughter is a lazy liar. Some people think they can get what they want by throwing a big enough fit."
4,aije30,t2_nliktfb,Nevertofart,"NTA. Don’t pay her. Your poor cat. My fiancé and I have a dog and two cats, when their litter is full they hold it until they absolutely can’t. (Happened once). When we go out of town, I hire my cousin to stay over. Pay her way too much for usually a max of 3 days til I found out she never even stayed at our place. Our pets love human interaction, that’s what i paid for. Couldn’t prove it, so I installed a camera for next time. Now pet sitters can’t lie. Has worked so far except for that time one person who didn’t know we have a camera and claimed to had fed the cats. "
4,aije30,t2_hh9wk,notastepfordwife,"NTA, but if they sue, they might get something, because while she MASSIVELY screwed up, your cat isn't dead.

4,aije30,t2_2kvbpz7t,Sybellie,"Nta. Some comments being the cats not dead, that doesn't make it ok. OP hired the sitter to live in her house for 7.5 weeks, you know to give the cats company for a few hours a day at least. Not make pop ins for 10 minutes every couple days. I wouldnt be paying someone over $1000 to spend 10 minutes feeding a cat and only occasionally cleaning the litter box. That's a 100$ job max, which I could just get a family member to do (and do the same for them as a trade). OP I'd ask how much time she actually spent with your cats, out of curiosity on my part."
4,aije30,t2_9rv5k,lyssargh,"NTA and her mother is completely ridiculous. Caring for your cat is part of owning one, obviously! You know that! She should know that! That's what her daughter was hired to do and she completely failed. Your cat lived in its own filth for weeks while you were gone. How is that less disgusting than cleaning out the litter pan? How was that preferable to her? Did she even stop by daily? Maybe she came in occasionally to give lots of food and water. Who knows? Paying her for neglect would make you more of an asshole than refusing to pay her for it."
4,aije30,t2_1yqznxbs,PlagueDrsWOutBorders,"NTA, and I'm sorry you all are going through this. From a legal standpoint, you hired her to provide a service, which she failed to provide. If you wanna challenge it, you will need proof that she did not provide the services requested. Unfortunately, I don't think you have that unless she admits to the lack of cleaning out the litter box. She will need to be paid still, I just don't know if it's the full amount. She did keep the pets fed and get the mail and effectively was working for you in that regard. I would personally decide if it's worth it to fight. Maybe cut the payment down by 30 percent because she failed 1/3 of her job? Be prepared that if you don't pay her then they could take it to small claims court and would have a decent case. Cleaning up the cat pee wasn't listed in the agreement it seems, and again you would need proof the litter box was not cleaned."
4,aije30,t2_7ua8i,Melmoe,"YTA, and that will be unpopular, but I am saying this because you hired someone who, from what I can tell, was not an experienced animal caretaker. I get that in your mind this should not be hard and honestly it is not hard, but you left the care of your rented home and your beloved pet to a 23 year old business associate's care. Right there is why I say YTA. First, no on every single end of leaving a beloved pet with a stranger and an inexperienced person for 7.5 WEEKS. Also, there is no proof that your cat did not have some serious issues with feeling neglected with said stranger as his/her family left him for 7.5 weeks. I would never leave an animal for that long nor would I leave it with someone they didn't know or was not completely vetted and trained/experienced in taking care of my beloved friend. In short, you shouldn't of left your cat in this manner. There are many resources now for taking care of an animal and many sites vet caretakers and then there appropriate care given 24 hours a day. Second, you picked a business associate's daughter (EEK!). That is rough to get yourself out from behind as being viewed as the ""bad guy"". You made a mistake hiring this girl. She probably did a shit job but there is honestly no way to prove it. Your best attempt at remedying such a situation is giving her the agreed price (to avoid a potential small courts claim) and not being a reference for her in the future, obviously. If you're in the US, the USPS puts a vacation hold on mail. Also, there are many high experienced and loving people whom are willing to bring in a family pet to take care of and loved into their home while you are on vacation which would cost around the same (but less considering the repairs now needed on your home). "
4,aije30,t2_pokms,Synjaqt,"NTA I think you should pay her some (maybe 100-250 out of the $1000), but definitely not the full amount and this is coming from someone who does pet sit and also has two cats. I remember I felt guilty for forgetting to put in this one family’s dog’s eye drops in once (I was supposed to do it twice a day in both eyes for the week I was watching them and I forgot to do one eye because their dog was giving me a hard time so I decided I’d do it when he calmed down and forgot). I can’t imagine doing something like forgetting to clean the litter box, it’s such a simple and necessary task"
4,aije30,t2_146ovr,goodgreat123,"YTA As a fellow pet sitter, things often don’t go as planned. Sometimes there are accidents that happen when a pet is acting out that you are gone. She cleaned the litter box every three days, I have two cats and usually clean the litter boxes every three days and they never look unusable— the cats usually cover up their mess and continue to use it. There is no visible mess after three days, which probably explains why she didn’t clean it every day as you asked. If she’s not familiar with cats she might not have realized the pee and poop was buried. Your cat might have been peeing outside the litter box as revenge for you leaving. She also kept your cat fed and brought the mail in like you asked. She wasn’t completely negligent, but might have misunderstood your instructions about the litter box. It’s wrong to refuse to pay her at all. She didn’t do 1/3 of the job you asked her to do exactly like you asked her to do it, but she DID keep your cat alive. I recommend paying her 2/3 of the agreed upon fee and never using her to cat sit ever again. "
4,aije30,t2_30kq3lbz,rueforyou,"NTA. She entirely failed to do one of the most important parts of her job. She neglected the cat and the cat must have been utterly miserable. She has caused you hours of work and a great deal of expense. In no way is this horribly neglectful girl due $1000. She's lucky you're not taking her to small claims court for damages and breach of contract. If the mother thinks this was ""the cat's fault,"" she is modeling terrible irresponsibility to her daughter. "
4,aije30,t2_wj8xv,PowerpuffPills,"YTA. You were willing to pay $1000, that's not an amount that will get you a well trained cat sitter. Now, you're living with the consequences of that decision. It is your cat, you took the risk of losing deposits by getting a cat in the first place. If you're reasonable, you can propose deducting some of the money for not following instructions fully, but she still worked for you for 7,5 weeks, fed your cat, took in your mail, so she has done 2 of the 3 tasks you set out for her and that would warrant at least 2/3 of the money. Either way, it's your cat and it was your decision to hire a non-professional to save money. Not paying someone who has worked for you - even if the job is only 66% well done - is a full on asshole move and I hope to God if you don't pay, they'll take you to court. Also, stop hiring random people to look after your cat, from your comments I can see your cat pees around when you're not home and your expectations of your non-professional cat sitters are way too high."

It is basic customer service skills to just refund the incorrectly added item and charge the customer for what they want in this situation, especially when you're courteous about it and you bring up the issue right away. They're the asshole for even arguing about it, because who cares who's fault it is. You could have misspoke, they could have missheard, they could have typed it in wrong, it doesn't fucking matter.

I want you to know you’re not an asshole but try to keep up with other family as best you can. Otherwise you’ll be branded the family asshole because your sister WILL manipulate everyone onto her side because she’s there and you’re not. I’m not saying force yourself to interact with her but even a phone call to keep up with everyone else is good. Ultimately avoid the topic of rekindling with your sister with everyone. It’s a minefield you’re walking into but it’s better than being around someone who tells you such horrible things. My dad didn’t care what his family thought at a certain point and decided to let himself be the family asshole. It works for him because he’s several states away, is loved by his favorite sister and nephew, and barely visits the area. But it still sucks and hurts him when his mother is needlessly hurtful with her words because he can’t “make up” with his abusive sister."

I will say that you shouldn't let her keep you from seeing the rest of the family that you like though. Sounds like it's large enough that you can get with the group but not interact with her in any meaningful way. Don't hurt yourself by missing out on time you'd enjoy if she wasn't there. 
4,b43kef,t2_2fhpp6z1,thebirbs,"NTA She sounds terrible. I wouldn’t choose to be around her if she was my own mother. If you can tolerate her at some point it may be good to be there for her kids, since the poor things have to be with her all the time. "

I hadn’t seen or spoke to him for nearly 6 years until literally about a month ago. This is one of those things where you either have to just let the person go, or just wait it out until the person grows the fuck up and realised what an ass they’ve been.

It might make you feel better to yell at her, but you just as easily could have explained in a normal tone of voice that she had you worried sick, and you're punishing her for both ignoring her curfew and not letting you know she was going to be late. You were right to ground her. Her actions have consequences."

If it's true that she is generally well behaved and has taken on more responsibilities and been a great help DESPITE how hard it much be on a young girl to lose a parent, then why can't you give her the benefit of the doubt if she says her phone died and she lost track of time?

You probably over-reacted. And it's okay to tell her that. Explain why it scared you, how much you love her and want to know she's safe. Make sure she has a car charger for her phone, and next time, use a friend's phone to let you know. Ask how she would handle it if she were the parent or her younger siblings did something like this. It at least gets her thinking about how worried she might be in the same situation. My ex left me. I'm chronically ill and mostly bed bound. Like you, it has changed the relationship I have with my teens, because they do have more responsibilities than most teens. I try to take the approach that we are team and need to work together. That means clear communication. Personally, I would apologize for yelling, explain that I was anxious because I was worried, and unground her on the understanding that next time, no excuses, she needs to contact you and let you know the plan. And if possible, try to find a way to alleviate her ""parenting"" burden. Can you afford a part time sitter for the younger kids? An after school program? Do you pay her for her time? You really don't want her to feel like a parent and burn out before she even is old enough to be a mom herself. Sending you love and support because this parenting shit is hard."
4,acx62a,t2_2tubscar,MostlyPretentious,"NAH, though verging on YTA. The yelling was unnecessary, but it’s good for her to understand actions have consequences, though given this is the first time maybe giving her a little leniency would be better. Given how she approached you, I’d say talk to her, let her know how worried you were and why you have the rules, but tell her she made a good point and maybe lighten her punishment."

4,acx62a,t2_839e9e7,Labalool,"ESH Your daughter sucks for staying out late and not contacting you (she could have used someone else's phone) You suck for yelling and grounding out of initial emotional response.

Even take your daughter our you and her time to time as a treat for all her hard work. Tbh I was very mature at 16 and wouldn't have appreciated grounding as a punishment. I would've much prefer to discuss concerns/apologise and understand that grounding is on the cards if it were to happen again but not for a first time offence. I had a job at 16 and would have been expected to be treated like the near 18yo I was. Also probably mentioning things you already know and have done but worth having a safety and relationship talk with your daughter when this is cooled down. Have a 'safe text' where she can pretend to ask to stay out longer but you know that's code for 'I really want you to say no' Discuss personal safety especially in case alcohol may be involved in future."

Apologize for yelling and thank her for doing so much to contribute but remind her that you are a parent and worry about her wellbeing and part of being a grownup is checking in with people who care for you.

You yelled because you were scared. Tell her that. Tell her that you were mad because you got so scared over not knowing if she was okay. In my grief support group they told us that it's actually a good thing when our kids see us break down over the death...it teaches them that it's okay for them to feel those feelings to, and it shows them that there is always a way out of those feelings."
4,acx62a,t2_ms4hd6u,Reverend_Vader,"YTA Now let me explain why due to quite unique circumstances. As i type this my daughter is out on the town on her own for the first time ever. (18 Today, UK drinking age) She has been through loads of shit not including losing her mother, she lost her brother. I did not have to put child rearing responsibilities her way but I have learned how much thrusting a kid into adulthood too early fuck up their head. When she lost her brother she also lost her mother who is now on low level autopilot, she has checked out of as much as she can do and more, when i speak to her she often complains about ""adulting"" her mother or the issues caused by her mom no longer taking that role. She needs to enjoy and experience childhood bro, give her a little more slack than you would give a normal 16 yr old. The more chill you are, the better she will respond and keep open communication with you, trust me here! The trade off for the parneting is a little more slackening of the reigns than normal, It's her release valve from having to play parent to kids at 16 and the push back can be huge if you get it wrong. Her mother has been all up in her business for today and she knew she'd be txting every 5 mins, what did she do, leave her phone at home. I've treated my daughter like an adult for a couple of years, i also never forgot she is a kid at heart and needs to feel independent. The scenario you are in now means screaming is the most counter productive thing you can do. Give her space and let her be with the agreement she keeps in touch. An hour is an hour, it's no biggy an easily passed when your'e enjoying yourself. I told my daughter i would treat her like an adult, however i also told her until she was 18 it was my house and my rules and all i needed was a 5 second txt saying ""chill dad, home soon/later"" "
4,acx62a,t2_nd7ra,here_kitkittkitty,"YTA!! holy crap bud, you could have gone about that so much better, it's no wonder she's upset. this sounds like it's the first time she's ever fucked up what she had to do(and her excuses seem valid. this shit happens on occasion)and your immediate reaction was to yell and ground?? i get you were worried but chill out a bit. you could have, calmly, explained that you were worried about her, that she needs to be more cognizant of her phone battery and time, then let it go. my mom use to overreact like this over a simple mistake and it made me hate her more than i already did(i'm not saying she hates you) and resent her. i think it's time you have a real sit down with her and see how she really feels about you putting extra responsibility on her. she's not a replacement for your wife(as it were)and you might be mommifying her too much. it's fine that you want her to help you out but you're the parent, not her. you have to make sure you're not putting to much on her. you don't want resentment for you and her siblings to kick in. "
4,acx62a,t2_q04mu,zeffke008,"NTA - at that time, you were worried and you wanted her to know. Yelling might not be the best option but she understood. If I may give my take on this, Id say sorry for the yelling, and ground her for like a week or maybe 2 and then make that curfew a bit longer (maybe 12~) like she can't even go to the late night movies if 8-9pm so to say. She is still a kid even if she has more responsabilities, but give her a but more room to do so."
4,acx62a,t2_w97pyo1,AmbulanceDriver3,NTA. Rules are rules and she’s old enough to understand them.

If you didn’t check it and hence missed any implications that this might be a sexual massage then YTA. You guys watch porn together, he thought you signed him up for it hence you’d have no problem with it (just like you have no problem with some other kinky stuff indirectly involving others such as porn). If it wasn’t advertised or implied to be a sexual thing and the place isn’t known for erotic massages then NTA (the masseuse is the asshole).

Not having access to my devices made this worse because that was how I talked to my friends. "
4,arooyg,t2_1to0qqa2,MikkiTh,"YTA I'm not saying no limits, but as a parent with kids around the same age? Half of their school work is online, and so is their social life. As long as their grades are good and chores are done there's not a real reason to restrict their access to so much. (My kids are 19 & 12, the oldest is in college and making access to tech conditional on good grades really worked out. He's in college on a full ride academic scholarship. The youngest is in 7th grade and so far except for the occasional ""Go to bed already, he's got mostly A's and is about as good about chores as can be expected. They get done, we just have occasional ""Do it better."" interactions.) "
4,arooyg,t2_1hr373o5,hellboyjv3,YTA: You’re being too strict on them. It’s almost as if you’re punishing them. If they are doing fine in school and are staying out of trouble then allow them freedom. If they do bad in school or cause trouble then take away phones or games. My parents let us use our phones and game systems as long as we finished homework and kept good grades. So let your kids have more freedom or they might resent you a bit for being so strict. They might throw you in a retirement home later in life.
4,arooyg,t2_11akmc,visvya,"YTA. How do your kids write research papers, look up khan academy videos, and develop computational literacy without access to their electronics? How do they text their friends for homework help or to organize extracurricular activities that will get them into college? Taking away their playstation during the week is fine, and setting a time limit for their laptops and phones is reasonable (say, 11pm). But this blanket ban is harming their ability to succeed academically and socially after they graduate high school. You could compromise by telling them to get a job and pay for their phone, but that would take much more time and energy away from their schoolwork. "
4,arooyg,t2_6rj74,enna12,"YTA They're not little kids anymore. IMO, they're old enough to have electronics. If you think they'll start slipping in school, wouldn't you want them to be able to use their phones outside of school so they don't use them in school? I'm sure you can find some common ground where you let them have them after all of their homework is done or setting time limits (there's plenty of ways to automatically set up parental controls like that)."
4,arooyg,t2_kwh0mxr,GoodQueenFluffenChop,Yeah you're kinda YTA. Their grades are good and they're not toddlers who need controlled screen time. It's one thing to have a no phones at the dinner table and at bedtime. What you're doing is a perfect punishment for when they let their screen time take precedence over chores and grades. Think of it this way it'll be good way to learn time management for when they're adults in that they'll learn there's a time and place for when they can goof around with their electronics. Them not having access to learn now just means that when they're 18 they'll go a bit crazy with them since it was the forbidden fruit.
4,arooyg,t2_2bn9nezk,hazelchicken,"**YTA** I understand your concerns but your 16 yr old son especially should be able to keep contact with his friends outside of school hours. He can drive, he can have sex, he can get married - but he can't text his mates? What are grades over the ability to keep contact with your friends? It'd probably feel pretty bad being the one friend everyone has spent the least time with. They can talk and play with each other whenever they like, they aren't isolated from the world every night. "
4,arooyg,t2_120l75bb,blitzedginger,"YTA. a) it seems that you're worried without cause since all the kids are doing well, and b) you could easily institute another rules system that would get you what you want such as ""no electronics until you've finished homework"" and ""you'll be grounded from your electronics if you miss assignments or get a failing grade"". But you should also really take into consideration what people are saying about kids these days actually needing their devices for schoolwork itself. Google, Youtube, Word, etc. helped me with homework every single night. That's a huge resource to take away and really ironic that it's being taken away ""to keep the focus on school"". I wouldn't discount the social impact either. I totally empathize with parents who worry about the tech downside: short attention spans, scrolling/check-in addiction, cyber-bullying, porn, you name it - but if kids don't have any access to phones & computers, honestly, the next problem you're looking at is how much you're isolating them from their peers and building resentment. It's kind of like they're grounded every single night and have to go no-contact with people Monday through Friday. That's going to have a harsh impact on their respective groups and friendships. Also...I don't think ""you must live only for school and that's all you need to worry about"" is really a good message. You're creating feelings of isolation and pressure where there just doesn't need to be. I really recommend loosening up a bit. Just because your teens will have more access to their friends & more things to do in their free time does not mean they're suddenly going to become different kids and start tanking in school. Bring some trust and balance to the table. I think your relationships will all be better for it. "
4,arooyg,t2_2e1l21r1,moll_moll_moll,"YTA. I understand the desire to build healthy habits and have solid rules but your kids are in their teens. It's 2019. You're pushing them away from you with this absurd extreme. Limiting their time would be a good approach in my opinion, but when I was in school electronics were necessary for communicating about group projects, using the internet for homework, and yes, some recreational browsing or gaming. Growing up in an uber strict house where we had rules like this drove a massive rift between my parents and I. On top of that- if their grades are good and they're being well behaved, show them some appreciation of that. Be proud! It sounds like you have good kids. You're doing a good job but definitely take stock of whether your approach is appropriate for this modern day and age. "
4,arooyg,t2_13f0ua,SamaramonM,"YTA. They're teenagers. All their friends are online. They're probably missing out on plans, birthdays, parties, making friends. It's the reality for teenagers these days, as hard as it is to grasp. Not to mention online research and literature needed for school. You're punishing them in a very stone-age way. And not to sound too harsh, I'm sure you mean well, but I would hate to be your kid. You can still prevent this. "
4,arooyg,t2_jqj5e,ceebee6,"YTA. It’s like the type of parent who holds close reigns and then doesn’t understand why their kid is floundering or struggles being an adult when they go off to college. Part of being a parent in teaching them and guiding them into adulthood. Better for them to make smaller, less impactful mistakes now and learn from them than to wait until they’re 19 and flunking out of college with $25k in student loans because they never learned to self-regulate and prioritize. Maybe it still makes sense for the younger two, but your son is 16, gets good grades and is responsible.

By not letting them have free reign of their electronics, you're teaching them that you don't trust them, which will cause a lot of issues now and later on. If you've parented them well, you should be able to trust that they won't do wrong and that they'll use the skills (mentally and physically) that you've taught them in order to be well rounded teenagers. My parents showed trust in me from an early age, as well as mutual respect, which is why I believe our relationship is so good. I'm not saying I never slipped up, but with their trust and support, it was a lot easier to come back from my mistakes and not resent them or fear them. Not to mention the internet is full of information and could definitely enhance their learning experience. I learned so much from being able to google anything at any moment, as well as it helping me immensely with my school work. You're going to inspire your children to rebel, and you don't want that, I'm sure. I can also tell you that this is definitely going to or already is putting a strain on your relationship, and their friends definitely think you're an asshole (not that that necessarily matters to you, but this stuff does spread).

Seriously, you're only fostering resentment, your kids are going to grow feeling like you don't trust them and in turn won't trust you back. They're teen/pre-teens already, they can handle teen/pre-teen responsibilities like not being on their phone all day. "

If they have places to improve, like you need them to be better about chores or something, I'd understand. But not even giving them the chance to earn their electronics makes you kinda an asshole. Do they even have a form of staving boredom off in the house? Board games? The ""all my friends have"" thing is a trash argument tho. Don't fall for it. Are the 14 year old and 13 year old even old enough to take transportation to meet their friends and hang out without you playing chauffeur? While I am in favor of holding their entertainment hostage if you can't seem to convince them to want to become adults, it just seems to have no gain here. "
4,arooyg,t2_x0xrm,Bluehorsemoon,"YTA, by their age I'd had a lot of practice setting limits for myself when it came to electronics so I could achieve better academically. You're clearly a very caring, hands-on parent but this strategy sets them up for failure because when they move out, they'll suddenly have unlimited access without having practised self-control. Considering how much they'll have to use electronics in adult life without your oversight, it could have some severe consequences. Self-control has to be learnt by trial and error so protecting them from making bad choices now will only make them learn those lessons when they're adults and can't afford to make as many mistakes. And I would second what everyone's said about it limiting their academic progress, but I assume you're leaving something out about them being allowed to go online on your laptop for schoolwork/research because I doubt you'd keep them away from all the educational material their classmates have access to."

In a couple years, he'll be out of the house and taking care of himself. He's going to have electronics during the week eventually; you have to decide whether you want that to be now where you can intervene and help if it becomes an issue, or if you want it to happen for the first time at college where a problem could destroy an entire semester before you can do anything about it.

Your son for an example he is 16, his hormones would be raging right about now and he is at a critical point in his live where he is learning to navigate social /romantic scenarios that will stick with him for the rest of his life. Imagine this below hypothetical scenario between a boy who mum bans technology on weeknights for a reason ( I honestly can't think of a good one unless they've shown a record of abusing it) and a girl who liked him.

What did you do to get in trouble?""

Bob: ""What? "" no response, unread. Bob: Hello? Msg from APP: ""This person no longer seems to be connected"" &#x200B; Later on, Bob sees, Marry in the lunch room and approaches her &#x200B; Bob: ""Hey Mary! Sorry about earlier, I think my phones playing up it said we were no longer connected I don't think my messages got through, I just wondering if you'd still interested in seeing a movie with me, I was thinking about maybe we could go thursday night?"" Mary: "" Sure your mum will let you? I mean Movies are a technology which is apparently evil and how would we get ahold of each other to meet up if you don't have a phone?"", the cinmeas would be packed! Sorry I have plans to uh wash my hair on thursday night anyway! &#x200B; and then she walks off with her friends while her friend are giggling at poor old bob because they get the context of her response because she told them all about dear old tiger mum. &#x200B; In that scenario, dear old Mum not only cock blocked her son but potentially made him a social pariah &#x200B; I am not Parent, so I am far from an expert but I am a son and I have been a 16 year old teenager.

You say you think their grades will slip if they have their phones during the week. This is true. Phones and other electronics can be a distraction, but they need to learn to manage this distraction on their own. The only thing that you're draconian policy is doing is depriving them of a valuable life skill: self discipline. They can't learn not to spend hours on their phones instead of studying if you confiscate their phones all the time. They're not going to be in your house forever. Eventually they'll move out and have to regulate their own phone usage, and have no experience doing so. I know you're trying to help but all you're doing is seeing them up for failure later in life.

Teach your kid that having a little candy every once in a while or spending a couple of hours on the computer isn’t going to kill them, but that overdoing it can cause serious problems. I think It’s fine if you don’t want them to have the tech overnight... I think that’s reasonable, or maybe just asking them to show you completed homework before getting access to their phones. I think an approach like this is much healthier."

My job even in high schooler needed me to have my phone around for various reasons, most social interaction and making of plans happens through phones, every classwork assignment I ever did was made easier via technology and open access to it. Setting some time limitations (such as no later than 11 for the older child, knock it back an hour for the younger ones), and simply punish them if their grades significantly drop. But doing it this way is practically punishing them for doing nothing wrong on the assumption that they’ll do worse otherwise"

4,arooyg,t2_1iy9o78q,ClumsyYeti,"YTA. There's a huge amount of middle ground between letting your kids have the electronics 24/7 and taking them away as soon as they get home. Think about it this way, why not teach them to use them in moderation? Say, an hour or two of playstation/laptop if all the homework/chores are done that day and grades are decent or something. And if they prove that they can't stick to those limits/keep their grades up \*then\* go back to limiting them again. What happens when they move out to live on their own for the first time? Unless your son constantly meets his friends outside/does team sport or stuff - online is where a lot of socialising happens these days, he's probably feeling left out/like he's being isolated. Also, I just noticed the ages. Your kids are old enough to learn how to use their devices responsibly. If this was about a younger kid that had a history of acting out and bad grades - ok, maybe. But one of your kids is 16, you say they have good grades.. Why such strict limits? If you're **really** concerned about the internet you could look into parental controls, for your younger kids (though personally I'm glad my parents never did that, I was a mature enough kid to have a good idea of what was ok/not ok to do - but obviously you know your kids best)"

I feel sorry for the kids today only sitting at home playing with their phones, however - if everyones doing it .. What can your kids do outside? Meet no one? Gramps? Just run around for hours hoping to find their friends somewhere ? If your reasoning were to have them more outside in the nature than is common these days - I wouldve agreed that beeing outside more is better but taking the kids ways of communication with their friends is a terrible way to go about it.

Your kids start acting out, adopting an attitude of ""Well, I'm already punished for shit I didn't do, might as well make it worth my while and actually do the thing I'm being punished for."" Setting boundaries for usage and standing firm in your punishments are fine but you can't limit your kids necessary (yes, necessary) electronics for fear that they *might* abuse it or their grades start slipping. Make clear rules and boundaries and if those rules are broken lay out clear and consistent punishment. If you intend on changing the rules in your household as a result of the answers given here be transparent with your kids on why you're changing the rules. Use the words ""I was/we were wrong"" and apologize for punishing them without reason; explain why you believed the way you did initially and then explain how you realized you were wrong. Your kids will learn how to apologize with grace, how to handle similar conflicts in the future, that adults are not without fault and that's okay."
4,arooyg,t2_2i0hn5pv,jordannross,"YTA ur punishing them for no reason.. during this time of their lives connecting with friends is VITAL I can’t imagine not being able to text my friends after I had a hard day after school or go online. Your depriving them for no reason... maybe if it was just the phones or just the laptop It wouldn’t be that bad, but no internet, phones or video games why are u being so evil kids need outlets to let out their teen angst. When ur a depressed teen or trying to find yourself the internet is ur best friend. Ur not allowing them to have a outlet and they will rebel sooner or later. They’ll probably get a burner phone or a iPad and hide it from u that’s what most teens do when their parents are this strict your setting yourself up for failure give them their technologies. I hope u see the other comments and decide to I feel bad for ur kids I honestly do. What if ur kids are in a really sad or depressed state they need to be able to contact their friends to let off steam, or to express their opinions what if they’re bullied at school or rumors about them are circulating at school. That’s something kids don’t talk to their parents about and need to talk to their friends about their feelings and ur preventing them of this. Mental heath is a huge issue among teens and teens have a high suicide rate. "
4,arooyg,t2_16ms18,Joey101937,"YTA the world is shifting more and more towards a ubiquitous internet; your parenting style is actually going to end up HARMING them in the long run when they finally grow up and enter a world where all their peers are 3 times as experienced as they are with electronics, navigating around questionable websites, downloading different tools, and general online information. "
4,arooyg,t2_zhustf4,laskullazazz,"YTA, but you obviously have good intentions. This practice is setting them up for failure. If the kids are planning on going college, they will have to police themselves on their device usage and if they weren't able to learn how while they still had someone to tell them ""no"", they're going to have a hard time. If they're staying at home while they attend school, then this is also a no go, I frequently get after hours messages regarding school, and while some of it could wait till the next day, some of it can't. There's also online homework, homework help, and group projects, and this could impact their grades. You won't be able to help them with their schooling at that level, unless you're a professional in that field, and if your kids can't coordinate in group projects, then how will they know what to do?"
4,arooyg,t2_avs3sro,Suq_Maidic,"YTA and you're being far too controlling. Letting your kids use technology isn't going to ruin their grades or change their behavior. Taking away electronics can work as a disciplinary measure if they *do* start struggling, but you're preemptively punishing them for something they haven't even done yet. How do your children communicate with their friends? Do they live nearby? Can your son drive? I had a long distance friend in high school and texting was the only way we could communicate. If you're restricting that contact, then you're an even bigger asshole."

4,arooyg,t2_i1m38,izzgo,"YTA in my opinion because you're keeping your children from growing with the world they're growing up into. For many generations now, including mine and yours, kids have grown up into a world their parents barely knew how to live in. You don't help them succeed in that new world by keeping them from the tools and skills central to it. All kids have to learn how to navigate the world they grow up into, not so much their parents' world. I could see supervised access in the evenings, so you can see how they're coping emotionally and intellectually. Are they deserting real life for video games, or can they play for an hour then join the family for dinner (for instance)? Are they learning many ways of using the internet, or do they find 1 or 2 favorite past times and ignore the rest? You can't guide them in this computer world if you don't see them using it."
4,arooyg,t2_xp8560v,deadheaddestiny,YTA I could understand for younger kids but once they are in their teens they should be allowed electronics. Your essentially grounding your kids all week for no reason
4,arooyg,t2_f43oi,Jootmill,YTA they’re not small children. Using the internet is how teenagers communicate and they risk missing out on things with their friends by you doing this. Why not take their phones away if their grades should slip and maybe make it so they don’t go online after 11pm or something instead?
4,arooyg,t2_krtbw,LaoSh,"YTA, the only time it's acceptable to judge kids on how they are spending time is if you are willing to give them an alternative. Did you consider taking them to the park or the beach or sitting with them and studying or working on a project? If you just took their devices and then left them to their own... devices, you accomplished nothing but used up an ""arsehole parent"" token that should have been saved for when they were acting out. It also sounds like this came out of no where which is not good developmentally. It diminishes their trust in you and they will be more likely to lie or deceive you in the future. Limiting screen time can be a very effective behavioural tool but you need to set proper boundaries. i.e. ""If your grades drop below X you will be limited to 30 minutes of screen time a night beyond what is needed for school"" but this has to be framed as a punishment for a pre-defined outcome. You also need to provide regular feedback on the progress of this punishment. Pop their teachers an email and ask them to keep you up to date with your kid's progress in class and slowly start giving back more screen time if the teacher reports an improvement. And you still need to provide a stimulating alternative, you are the parent, not the screen. Also, phones are a very valuable communication tool for people that age. You and I might have socialised face to face but kids communicate electronically, you are cutting them out of their friends lives by doing this and will harm their social development.

Not to mention that 16 year olds are nearly adults and are learning how to be social and establish long lasting friendships and that’s impossible this way. So yeah.

4,arooyg,t2_qhki5,SB-1,"NTA. It's right to limit their access to technology due to the well documented mental health issues it causes, but you're going overboard not allowing them any time at all because it puts them at a social disadvantage.

4,arooyg,t2_2ze5g0tg,Kellogz27,"INFO What is the reason you take the phones away? If there's no real reason, then YTA. I'll copy and edit what I said in another comment here: Discipline always has a bigger goal in mind. It's never the end goal. For example, when someone grabs a child by the arm because they are screaming inside a store, the grab is the disciplinairy action. The grab is not the ultimate goal. The goal is for the child to stop screaming. The goal is a change in behavior to be positive. By taking away the electronics without any good reason, you're not really serving a bigger goal. They are behaving like they should, grades are good etc so why have a displinary action? What do you want to teach your childeren? you're basically saying: ''don't do the most effective thing to complete your daily tasks, because potatoes.'' If the goal is to teach her childeren how to use technology correctly, this is counterproductive. It's not teaching them how to use the technology, it's just taking it away. They are not learning how to use it effectively, for no reason whatsover. It would be different if they were on their phones 24/7 or their grades got really bad etc, but that's not happening. I've never understood parents who take away electronics without reason and parents who give childeren unlimited acces from a very young age. Both of those things can be bad. You can actually teach childeren a lot about technology if you do this together. Keep a eye on what they are doing online, set some small boundaries and be ready to help them when things go bad. That's something that the childeren learn from and makes them better in using technology and being a better adult."
4,arooyg,t2_2oxw45vo,nepsola,"NTA, but I think there is room for some middle ground. For instance, why not give your kids access to tech (the reward they want) at a certain time each night, like once they've completed their homework? Why not have a thing where they come home from school, everyone's phones are dropped in a drawer or something (including yours), while they do homework and you all have dinner, then their evenings are free to spend as they please? Not as this strict enforced rule, but as a ""tech detox"" rather than a complete technology ban. EDIT - Also, to add. You'd be better off giving them the chance to learn to regulate their technology usage now. Because as some others have mentioned, strict rules can lead to severe rebellion later on. When they go to university or move out and get jobs (whatever it is for them), they are way more likely to binge on tech because they have the freedom to do so. Whereas if you can instil in them a healthy relationship with technology, and one that they actually come to appreciate, they are more likely to do well with that as adults."

I had never learned out to budget my time so to speak because electronics and basically things that werent sports and studying were banned during the week.

You said yourself that he stopped drinking, then when he started drinking again that he started falling into “old habits.” The key word there is habits. Even if he stops drinking while you two fix things, what’s to stop the habits from returning once you give him the “okay” to drink a bit again?

Telling her she deserved bad experiences was beyond petty, it was pathologically self-involved on your part."
4,b14bpm,t2_ccasgn,Wednesday_Atoms,"YTA. Most people (*not just men*) who regularly use online dating get ghosted at one point or another. You've called this woman a sociopath, called her behavior sickening, and said some pretty sexist things in your replies about women and what your owed. (Yes, I saw your reply that the owed card doesn't work here *eye roll*). You're dramatically exaggerating the extent to which you were hurt and downplaying her own victimization in order to... What? Get sympathy? Justify your shitty behavior? Let it go. "
4,b14bpm,t2_hkncr,dmtvile,"NTA because it is not offensive in my eyes. she said she made bad choices that get her in a bad ship and baby daddy got himself into prison (unless framed or something). she sounds like a brat, meaning you two have different priorities. whats neat is how people that dont value other peoples time end up together and they bitch about it... so funny"
4,a3kdx6,t2_se0dibn,310k,"NTA. If I understand correctly you're now supposed to mow the lawn every other week instead of once every three weeks? I mean, it's not the end of the world or a life and death issue, but it's still a dick move by your roommate to just force this on you. I agree that simply asking for this favor or negotiating a trade in chores would've made all the difference here. Personally I would've been mowing the lawn despite this, but that's just because I'd like to avoid confrontation and rather keep the peace."
4,9tvesl,t2_17429v,MrCookieFrog,"NTA, but also a pretty silly position. While neither side may hold identical values to yours, I can guarantee that one will still align more with you on certain issues, and you must find that person/party and vote for it, sure, you may still be choosing an 'evil' but lets be honest they aren't actually evil, just hold some view you don't like, and still want the best for your community most likely, at least in some aspects. It is about being an active part of your community and making sure you are represented in government."
4,9tvesl,t2_ac3f7,Codadd,"As long as you never once give your opinion ever on the state of politics or complain about taxes and roads and stop signs and street lights or whether the roads were salted. Etc. If you want to complain about govt regulations, the president, or the news then you need to vote. If you do those things a lot YTA. If you are literally a hippie who lives in a fairytale world and is okay with every thing that is happening in your country then NTA."
4,b06yaj,t2_4bjgn55,Iwilllieawake,"NTA, though what you said to her was kinda pushing the line. Question though; did she start or change birth control? I know when I started birth control it tanked my sex drive, and one in particular made it basically impossible for me to enjoy sex with my husband. Once I stopped using it things went back to normal. Alternately, you could ask her to guide you to things she enjoys. Communication is so important in the bedroom, and so many people keep silent about what they like because they're embarrassed or afraid of offending their partner. "
4,b1tc1q,t2_1nbysgdo,otherwhiteshadow,"NTA Her insecurities are showing and she's taking it out on you. You owed her honesty, and as long as it was given in a loving/caring way then you were correct for being honest. Body dismorphia in its many forms can be a bitch. But if she hates the weight she can do something about it, however it seems from what you wrote that she probably has deeper self-worth related issues that probably contributed to the weight gain. *spelling"
4,b1tc1q,t2_p4dqw,HelloSchrodi,"NAH It sounds like you are a supportive partner. Part of being a loving and supportive partner is honesty. You love her enough to tell hard truths in an appropriate way. Sometimes those truths suck. Instead of taking that conversation and turning it into something constructive, she's blaming that conversation for all the negative feelings she has towards herself. Everything she's voicing now was probably locked up in her noggin for a while. And I hope it goes without saying that you are NTA for losing physical attraction. 40lbs is big on a taller women, 40lbs is a massive change on someone shorter. Does it suck? Yeah. Can you still love someone despite it? Yeah, but intimacy is a vital part of most healthy relationships. She can either work through it, hopefully with a loving and supportive partner by her side (OP), or she can focus on OP being the cause of every body negative thought and do nothing but feel sorry for herself. You only gave advice when she would ask and tbh, her complaining without actual effort to change would drive me a bit batty. If you had been nagging her to lose weight, ywbta. If you had said those words in a moment of anger, ywbta. If you dumped her before giving her a chance to change, or gave her an ultimatum, ywbta. But you did none of those things. Keep your chin up and I hope you two can work through this. "
4,b1tc1q,t2_2tm2gxjx,Ann-von-Beaverhausen,"NTA. I feel bad for her that she’s down, but picking out a flaw and pointing it out to your partner over and over again is a surefire way to get them focused on the flaw, yah know?"
4,b1tc1q,t2_nd7ra,here_kitkittkitty,"NTA!! if the girl wasn't ok with you telling her the truth she should never have brought it up in the first place. you don't acknowledge your short comings(as it were)and then get mad when people agree. you aren't a yes man there to powder her ass. if a comment you made, in agreeance of her own thought processes, is still affecting her months later she needs to start fixing it or stop bringing it up. her feeling bad is her brain knowing she needs to do something. "
4,b7ko06,t2_1oxbi0zm,neek_28,"NTA you can’t keep that toxicity in your life. I believe you will know when the time is right to attempt to make amends. I do think you should talk to your brothers ( if you feel they won’t inform your mother of it ) and see if they know her feelings on the situation, and maybe reconcile if she seems to show remorse."
4,b7ko06,t2_32f1rci2,1z2x3y,"NTA. I did the same 14 months ago for the same reasons. Its hard to go no contact and there is so much social pressure to sweep the abuse under the rug because ""but she's your MOM. She's family!"".... Well, sharing DNA doesn't excuse abuse. And when people feed me that crap my go to explanation is this: an abuser is an abuser. A mother is not supposed to be the reason for her child's heartbreak but she is and no matter how many chances i have given or excuses i have made, she hasn't changed. And she never will. I didnt deserve it then and i dont deserve it now. My kids dont deserve it either and dont need to have the abuse normalized. And if staying away is going to protect us then thats what is going to happen. "
4,ad3esd,t2_11sa9x,RoisinBean,"I have to go with YTA. I can't tell anyone they aren't if they obviously know they're paying for less than they expected to pay. I work at a GS, and while if I were in that position I would accept I seriously fucked up, the fact that you say you noticed before checking out makes *you* an asshole. This could mean a firing or a first and final. The supervisor that was working would also get in trouble, probably to the extent of a write-up or first and final, as well. If it hasn't been too long, I say you should fess up and pay what you should have. Just because ""the employee fucked up so it's not my problem"" is the popular argument, it doesn't mean it's the honorable or morally correct thing to do."
4,awwmsy,t2_1xbolcbq,themarajade1,"YWBTA. You sound like you’re still trying to control your grown daughter’s life. If this is what she wants to do with her life, you need to support her. If she wants to step up to that role, that’s her decision, not yours. If you discourage this it’s not going to do anything but cause tension between you two. If she ends up marrying this guy and taking on step-motherhood, you also don’t need to be that asshole grandparent that doesn’t love a kid because it’s not biologically related to you. Don’t turn into a JUSTNO relative. If you don’t think she’s cut out for the role then it’s a lack of faith and trust on your part. Age is also irrelevant to parenthood. I had my oldest at 19 and have done a fairly decent job. Let her make her own choices. ETA: coparenting is possible without anyone being a “second fiddle.” It’s no different than the kid having a stepdad. As long as she and the kids bio mom get along fine, nobody’s gonna be “second fiddle.” That’s the worst mentality to have. "
4,awwmsy,t2_wi862,kotominammy,"YTA, she's a grown adult who's making her own decisions. You don't get a say in what you want or don't want for her anymore, only she does. Not to mention imo your opinion is very rude and uncalled for. Step parents aren't just second fiddle to the child, it depends very much on the relationship between them and their blood & step parents. Besides, you have a weird focus on the kid when she is probably more interested in living with her partner -- why do you focus so much on not wanting her to ""come second"" to a child?"
4,awwmsy,t2_l86w5pi,mijuni,"YTA. I don't even understand your worry. Why would she be second fiddle if there is a kid involved? Does that mean all kids or only step kids? And if so, why? I am usually more concerned about step kids being the 90th fiddle, I rarely hear about new partners getting too little attention."
4,awwmsy,t2_2ep44cw,Frozen_Black_Heart,"YTA. She is willing to step into one of the most difficult roles a person can be asked to step into. You should be proud of her. What's worse, you're contributing to one of societies most overlooked (imo) double standards. If a man backs out of a relationship because a woman is a single mom, he is often considered to be shallow or a bad person. But women refusing to date single dads is somehow acceptable. Unless you truly feel your daughter is unfit to be a parent, then this is complete bs, and frankly, you suck as a person. That child deserves to be loved, your daughter deserves to be with a man who makes her happy, and when you love someone, you accept any ""baggage"" that may come along with that. I'm sorry, but you need to grow up. Edit: Just as a btw, moving in after only a year, especially when a child is involved does seem a little quick, maybe. But since that wasn't mentioned as being your issue, I ignored that in my response. If she is sure it's the right choice for her, its not your place to interfere, at least not for the reasons you have given. "
4,awwmsy,t2_10vu8g,Siren_of_Madness,"YTA As a stepmother, you are definitely the asshole. Why would she have to play ""second fiddle"" to the mother? Why can't she be a positive, meaningful addition to a child's life as a BONUS parental figure? I get along fantastically with my husband's ex-wife. We have large (and I mean LARGE, her family is Cuban) family gatherings where the entire extended and step families all consider ourselves to be actual family! At this point, my stepsons have five sets of grandparents! It's great!"
4,awwmsy,t2_32fmj8kd,KjellRS,"YTA. Is this really about the possibility that she'll be content just raising someone else's kid and you'll never have biological grandchildren? Because he and his kid come as a package deal and he's already used to being a single dad so whatever she's not ready for he'll handle. If anything this is trying out as a parent, unlike becoming a real parent where she's stuck with that decision so if she's immature and unsure if she wants kids this is perfect training/testing ground. All I see is construed concern on her behalf because you're not happy with the choices she's making."
4,awwmsy,t2_10330o,evoLyllaeR,"YTA for a couple reasons. One, your child has said she doesn't want a pregnancy to have a child. Here you're ignoring that this way she gets to nurture without pregnancy in a way that's acceptable to everyone involved... Except you. Two, she is an adult. If it's the wrong choice, she gets the most benefit from making the mistake and learning about herself in the process. It's not your choice to make and you can't interfere in her life, or it isn't her life anymore. Three, did i miss it where she actually asked you? Just stay out of the way. "
4,b8cqym,t2_qaaph,TooLateHindsight,"*Edit* YTA Upon further information, I believe OP is more interested in keeping his vacation days then making the harrowing ""day and half"" journey to see his grandfather. ---- (Old post below) Real tough call. Why not just go now and spend time with Grandpa while it's still a viable option? Then missing the funeral won't seem like such a big deal to dramatic family members that weren't there recently when he was alive..."
4,b8cqym,t2_2ybt10oc,j_mor23,"NTA its more important what you do while someone is alive then while they are dead, so go visit them in the nursing home more often instead if possible, she'd like that and it would probably help her pass happier having spent more time with you, and yes even with dementia having family around helps them. In the end she's really not gonna care about her funeral. "
4,a6jc38,t2_bz0l1,MrMikeJJ,"NTA. Her friend should have given her a seat. They were trying to play the guilt game to get two seats. Reminds me of a comment on reddit a few months ago. Woman in first class (on an aeroplane) askes the person next to her to swap seats with her husband in 3rd class, so they could sit together. Got offended when told that whoever was sat next to her husband would love to swap seats with her. "
4,a6jc38,t2_5h5yon,VictorZiblis,"NTA. Furthermore, you can actually call the driver to resolve these situations. There are cameras on at all times. You really wanna make this right? Call police non emergency and fill out the paperwork for a simple battery charge. The bus company has footage, and the lady will think twice about being this way again when she remembers she got a fine and hours of community service, as well as a criminal record, the last time. That is the right thing to do because behavior like this escalates and she may assault someone next time. Real life is not high school: it's no longer called ""bullying."" Words like harassment, assault, and battery are the ones adults use, and courts back them up."
4,a6jc38,t2_161sdr,GrumpyOldFart74,"NTA I *was* going to say ESH because your failure to study sufficiently in advance is your problem... But as I was writing that I convinced myself this MUST have been a deliberate ploy on their part. There is no way anyone would EVER take the seat of a pregnant friend unless they’d just had major surgery or something, and even then they’d try you with the sob story first. As I’m sure they were just running a scam to get your seat, it tips the cuntyness side of the equation completely in their direction. "
4,a6jc38,t2_2ktm3y26,confusedspeckledcow,NTA they dont know your health . I look perfectly healthy. I cant stand more than 30 min at a time without paying for it in massive pain. And on that merit alone you are not the asshole
4,a6jc38,t2_j1btm7b,Gilgamesh107,"man after reading that headline i came here rubbing my hands together ready to call you an asshole. but after reading this it just seems like they are fucking stupid, actually since that woman managed to shift the blame to you after taking her pregnant friend's seat she may not be so stupid. NTA either way"
4,a6jc38,t2_a5f3n,StormFunsoms,"NTA. Yeah, a pregnant woman should have a seat, but the lady beside you clearly should be able to stand for more than 5 min and ""tought it out"" for her friend at best.. but no, lets ruining this guys moment of study so that me and my friend can be lazy"
