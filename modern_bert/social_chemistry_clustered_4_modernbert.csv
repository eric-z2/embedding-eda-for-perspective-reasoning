4,aeaw4t,t2_1szgnkow,NonnoBobKelso,"NTA They are American as well or they are from the Continents of America, but when they suggest you don't call yourself American, do they give an alternate, or are you just not allowed one, which would be ridiculous."
4,aeaw4t,t2_10eud3,DragonTigerBoss,I've heard that South Americans do this because their schools teach the Americas as a single continent. NTA regardless. They're being jingoistic nematodes for challenging a stranger's national identity.
4,aeaw4t,t2_4at5t,Lucavious,YTA for squabbling over the merits of a seemingly arbitrary designation in this situation. Just tell 'em they're not fat enough to be real Americans and diffuse the situation. No need to make it a big deal.
4,aka65b,t2_jr5of,lavasca,YTA You’ll see it in a few years. Better to deal with embarrassment now than in college. Toughen up. That sale paid for your tuition. Critique your dad’s smoking because it jeopardizes his health not because it embarrasses you.
4,aka65b,t2_2bswm839,Skullbearer55,"YTA, but as a teenager that's excusable. Teenagers will pick on each other for any reason. My parents had good jobs, I have good clothes and tech, and I was still teased because I ate sandwiches. It's not a cause, it's an excuse. "
4,aka65b,t2_deuyp12,thesugarslug,YTA. He’s trying to provide for you. I get that girls can be mean. I was a teenage girl once. But damn give the man a break
4,9v4v5g,t2_914nb,cyberchief,"NTA. It's a lose lose situation. You lost $750, he lost $1000. In the future, any transaction with a friend/family member like this should be treated as a gift. You're gifting him a car for $1000 and if he somehow pays another $750, well then that's a bonus. At this point based on his behavior, I would chalk it off as a $750 lesson to never engage in anything financially with your brother ever again. "
4,9w539i,t2_y5tlr,SlicedNugget,"NTA. Nothing wrong with listening to novels like that, it’s ignorant to pretend stuff like that didn’t happen, but be professional, do it on your own time and not in front of clients. "
4,9w539i,t2_p1g0lcr,kmartimcfli,"NTA. Regards of your past, as a medical professional myself, this is unacceptable. If he were alone the whatever but transporting anyone while clocked in to any job really this sounds horrible "
4,9w539i,t2_wq5w9,DMVbandz,When I read the title I was expecting something like 50 shades but Jesus Christ wtf was that guy thinking listening to that without headphones on and with other people in the car? NTA besides the fact that’s wildly unprofessional it’s really fucked up
4,amv8ew,t2_1to0qqa2,MikkiTh,"NTA For tonight the moment the arguing starts? Leave. In general, visit when they aren't there & use exams as an excuse. If they complain point out that you attend as much or more than your brother. "
4,b3hvgo,t2_hrgdk,orangeoliviero,"NTA. Right or wrong, the front desk clerk shouldn't have been rude. Getting the manager involved to authorize the extra parking was required, but the employee should have volunteered it - ""I can see your point, but I don't have the authority to authorize that. Let me get my manager for you"""
4,b3hvgo,t2_3g3vz7cl,Bob5551234,"NTA. Employee shouldn't have been rude, and if he couldn't authorize an extra 2 hours' parking for a good customer, he should have gone to the manager himself to make the request."
4,b3hvgo,t2_3b99y4ok,binx_au,"NTA - There is no need to be condescending in service. It goads customers into a reaction, which is how I interpreted the scenario. Plus, as best practice given the history of your company with the hotel, the hotel should have already noticed and offered to extend the parking. Service excellence is managing expectations."
4,b3hvgo,t2_2jcujfgd,majesticjules,"NTA If they had extended parking before, it's perfectly reasonable to expect them to do it again. One of managements functions is to make judgements like this. Asking a manager about the parking was the right call."
4,b3hvgo,t2_97s9i,faisent,"NTA - you've given good business for years, and one punk employee wants to mess that up. He's either an idiot causing an issue because he doesn't know any better, or he's a petty tyrant (and from your description the latter). Some people literally can't have any measure of power at all. He feels like our Orange in Charge."
4,b3hvgo,t2_qzhsx,MakeAutomata,"YTA, just because you were given exceptions in the past doesn't mean you are owed them in the future. You should have KINDLY asked to speak to the manager. Not immediately go into ""We spend x money"" Thats asshole talk, clerks at the counter rarely get to decide when they can break the RULES they had to reexplain to you."
4,b3hvgo,t2_3d3pjchl,drbiddy,YTA. They were just doing their job. If you’re spending so much money just pay for the extra hours. You are every current and former customer service worker’s worst nightmare.
4,b3hvgo,t2_3fwoqd3v,DogTaintToucher,"YTA So, your response to being told you need to pay for extra services, is that because you are already paying for services, you are entitled to others for free? I don't care what anyone has to say about that, you and anyone with this kind of mentality is an asshole."
4,b3hvgo,t2_1hxmjo7j,Link2019,YTA- You should of asked for them first. Employee will get blamed if they just do that. Next time talk to him first instead of fighting with the employee
4,b2yfsl,t2_1r6b8ht2,Tigercatzen,"NTA I don't always agree with HOAs, but this is a situation where the HOA should be the one dealing with it. Your child shouldn't have to be afraid to go outside. Not to mention the neighbors may be violating actual laws, so going to the HOA works in their favor."
4,b2yfsl,t2_e923w,bmcthomas,"NTA, but the HOA may not be able to solve the problem for you. HOAs can only enforce the rules that are written into their governing documents, they don't mediate disputes between neighbors. So the HOA might be able to address the dogs pooping on the HOA property, but not your private property. Are there rules about the number of dogs, if they must be leashed, how often an owner has to pick up dog poop in his own back yard in your governing documents? Does your HOA have the authority to fine written into its documents? Let's say best case scenario, the HOA has rules about all those things, and the governing documents allow them to fine or even require the dogs to be removed if they are deemed a nuisance. And the HOA sends all their letters and fines, and the dog owner ignores them. Deed restrictions are a civil contract - they are enforced in the courts. Do you have a Board of Directors willing to incur the cost of a lawsuit? I would call Animal Control rather than the HOA. Virtually every city has rules about dogs having to be leashed in public, disposal of waste, and keeping the dogs in sanitary condition. And the city will have much more power to enforce than an HOA will. "
4,aw1a97,t2_16ihjhtq,bigfatgato,"NTA. He asked you for an honest opinion, and you gave it to him. I adore proofreading essays. I always tell anyone point blank that i will always find faults, so if they’re not willing to have an open mind to real criticism, they can just keep it to themselves. "
4,aw1a97,t2_35t18h93,uselessthrowacc,"Well I understand, I have a friend the same. So I’d say NTA, but you could’ve handled it better, is all. He still needs to grow up and handle criticism. I also applaud you for being able to look back and say you were slightly in the wrong, takes a sound mind :) (Edit: This was supposed to be in reply to your reply about info, sorry OP.)"
4,b4ohtf,t2_tymcq,MrSnowflake2,"YTA. Not necessarily for your original comment (we all put our foot in our mouth sometimes), but for the face you didnt back down and drop it the second you got called out. "
4,a9wlbm,t2_1lvc81je,P_Flange,"NTA. Whenever people have to ignore shit things ""for the good of the group"" it generally means that the group cohesion is fairly tenuous, to begin with. If they couldn't stick up for you then don't feel bad for a second that you left. You deserve better than people who are only your friend when it's easy and convenient. "
4,avxz68,t2_6tx9fq,boomboombipbip,"NTA, this won't be welcome news for the woman, she is more likely to be angry with you. If may also be that she already knows but doesn't think anyone else does and takes comfort in that. You just don't know what you are walking into and you win nothing for giving out this information. "
4,b1i0tc,t2_lv0rw,LeilaZeic,"NTA. His depression isn’t an excuse for him to act like a wounded victim. Also, since you didn’t cause these feelings apologizing that he help that way tells me you were trying to be sympathetic to his feelings. I hope your husband is undergoing treatment for his depression."
4,9z43x5,t2_m52b2,Aurion7,"If it were *your* car, it would be a very clear-cut NTA. It being a shared thing makes it a bit more complicated, but still leaning NTA. There's nothing wrong or even particularly unusual about being a bit uncomfortable driving a car you're not familiar with. Provided you weren't an asshole with how you went about explaining that, you're golden."
4,9z43x5,t2_bt5u0,ogurzhov,"I think NTA. If your sister can easily drive other car if it's available, being the less experienced one you should have a choice of driving a car that you are comfortable with."
4,9z43x5,t2_wq5w9,DMVbandz,Even though it’s a shared car I don’t see any reason for her not to be able to take the other 2 without stressing. Depending on how long you’ve had your license it would be good to learn to drive the others too though NTA 
4,ap4zff,t2_17fp6e,whatwhatwutyut,"NTA. He was ranting, you tried to calm him down. He didn't want to so you ended the conversation. I think you handled it maturely by ending the conversation instead of arguing over something that he obviously wasn't going to change his mind on."
4,as96jr,t2_15z6yu,KAbNeaco,"NTA. Oooooh, tell him your generation is the way they are cause they were all left to 'cry it out' as kids. /s But in all honesty, your dad needs to recognize that you and your wife have decided how to raise your daughter, and that advice counter to that style isn't helpful."
4,b64cu1,t2_6xv4k,backstageninja,NTA. Many places have adopted programming that waits a second or two after one light goes red until the other light goes green. They used to happen more or less simultaneously. Unless that was the situation here that bus went early
4,b64cu1,t2_1p7tx6j0,omygoodnessreally,"NTA Info: where was the bus in relation to you? At the busy/accident prone intersections near me, they put in cameras and you get ticketed...people learned real fast to stop at yellow lights instead of speeding up. It keeps the intersection from being clogged up too (""don't block the box"") (Edited for vote)"
4,azzate,t2_vkzyd20,Min_sora,"NTA - She started it, and it was incredibly inappropriate of her. I might be sensitive, though, having also come from a council estate and having to hear this shit all the time. "
4,a4qvsm,t2_a37qc,Outlashed,"NTA Because he had a bad past, and it sounds like he's turning around - He still needs to chip in, you're not his Charity Foundation. The guy got arrested 10 times in 2 years, it's not unfair for you, to doubt him regarding his future - Reformed or not."
4,ay3qov,t2_2u3wuf9y,tairo-,"NTA - I totally understand this and you have every right to get mad at her for it. It sucks to have something you work on - no matter what it is - get nearly messed up. While there are better ways to go about it, you aren’t the asshole"
4,ava5fh,t2_xljtu,Daedalus871,"NTA. You're pretty borderline with your atheistic zealotry, but I'm going to say you're not an asshole for wanting to raise children you would be responsible for how you want."
4,ava5fh,t2_1kfdjj5y,avocado__dip,"NTA. You shouldn't be expected to change your whole lifestyle while also doing a favor to your sister. However, I doubt her wishes are enforceable. Her kids likely won't go to the state if living relatives are alive. Also, it likely can't be monitored if you raise the kids with religion or not. I think the best move is to lie to her, let her die in peace, and raise her kids as you wish."
4,ava5fh,t2_64okfqd,CNNWillBlackmailYou,"NTA The children are not your responsibility unless you agree to it. YOUR children ARE your responsibility, and you're right to want to do whatever is necessary to raise them well. If this woman flat out has said that she'd rather her kids die than live with you, then sounds like you're free and clear. She's an asshole on SO many levels. And yes, the bleeding hearts are going to cry, ""do what's right for the children!"" No. Not his job. Not his kids. His only obligation is to do what's right by HIS children, not some self-righteous asshole's children. If that's your stance, then every single one of you who have not yet fostered or adopted is an asshole. Not your circus, not your monkeys."
4,ava5fh,t2_gvrycsn,HanabinoOto,"Dude, just enroll them in Sunday school and you'll get the money to raise them. Every other day of the week, you can teach them your humanist ethics. Their lives will be so much better of you bend just a little. YTA but it's not too late "
4,ava5fh,t2_emcns,Odeon42,"NTA - But I don't know legally how she could force you to raise them christian after she passes? It's a shitty situation, but in the end not your responsibility."
4,a1i9np,t2_xq7bhw,Sterixx,NTA. When couples choose a destination wedding they should understand that they're taking a risk that some guests won't be able to attend due to financial reasons and life commitments. If they don't understand then they're being unreasonable.
4,aun6qc,t2_mqtgk,mayfleur,"NTA. Paying it forward is supposed to be about helping out others because you have the extra means to do so. You guys didn't have the money to pay for twice the people in your party, so it's understandable. "
4,aun6qc,t2_50suk2j,ErrantJune,"NTA. Paying it forward is voluntary. Maybe sometime down the road you'll buy somebody's coffee or cover somebody's check, but you're not in the position to do that right now and that's okay."
4,aun6qc,t2_mfzwh8,bobd785,"NTA. A pay it forward chain isn't meant to put a burden on anyone. It's supposed to be a nice thing to do, and it actually fulfilled its purpose in this case when it got to poor college kids who could use some extra help. You aren't obligated to pay if forward if you can't, but it would be nice if you do something like that in the future when you can afford it."
4,b6i6nc,t2_11iw9s,Jarsky2,"YTA, but a soft YTA since you're open to understanding. A lot of trans people do make the fact that they are trans an integral part of their identity, and it's not right to tell them not to do so."
4,b6i6nc,t2_3e9jq95q,BB_butterfingers,YTA and yes as a cis person you do not understand the importance of the inclusion of “trans” in her title. Good for you that you see her as your feminine equal but her title is not about you. Please say you’re sorry and back off.
4,b8whnf,t2_6e5mb,KissMyGoat,I would say YTA for not allowing them to make their own decisions regarding their own safety. They are not children and they can weigh up the risk vs reward for themselves. You are free to express your concerns without becoming TA but as soon as you tried to guilt them into the course of action you preferred you became TA
4,azbqau,t2_1kfdjj5y,avocado__dip,"NTA. Chris's parents really made the situation awkward. Why would they think you magically have enough food to feed 4 more people with no notice? Even if you wanted to accommodate them, there was nothing you could do in that time frame."
4,azbqau,t2_11f38g,Akasgotu,NTA. The parents shouldn't have put you in that position. I don't think you really need to worry about Chris coming over. You've already set the precedent that you will not be pressured into inviting them.
4,azbqau,t2_2onl5t0j,run_fast-eat_ass,"Because of how you responded, YTA. You didn't need to be so judgemental about it. I get that you don't want to be consistently feeding them all but your reaction was rash and probably a little embarrassing. You didn't have to usher them out so fast."
4,azbqau,t2_feoob,Phil0s0raptor,"NAH but possibly YTA. Sounds like they were being polite in complimenting you. It may have already been awkward since they are on your turf. Nobody asked to stay for dinner. You made assumptions and possibly embarrassed the family. However, it is hard to tell what really happened from your description because it is all based on what you perceived rather than any obvious bad behaviour."
4,azbqau,t2_vszx21d,JanuarySoCold,"NTA We grew up poor, dinner was one piece of chicken for everyone. Four extra mouths at the last minute would be impossible to feed. "
4,azbqau,t2_vamq2,Stogamer-5,"NTA as of now. Don’t punish your son or his friend for his family’s issues. You may think it’s no big deal but if your son wanted to hang elsewhere with his friend, he would be already. Keep the status quo otherwise YTA."
4,azbqau,t2_niron,OfficialModerator,"Eeesh, honestly I'm torn on this one. Feels like they had planned on getting a hot meal - perhaps they are freeloaders trying it on or perhaps they desperately needed help. Either way, you are not responsible for them so NTA however it is strange alright. "
4,azbqau,t2_2uybt93z,thunderbuttxpress,"NTA, but, as someone who grew up poor and with unstable parents, your comments on the issue makes me incredibly sad for Chris."
4,azbqau,t2_39uxxtjt,3ontheteeth,NTA! Why are they being so imposing and weird? ‘Not really’? Way to make an innocent bystander feel guilty for whatever is missing in their lives. That’s pretty rude and you shouldn’t have been subjected to that.
4,azbqau,t2_nagfz,OneTwoWee000,"NTA OP, you’re looking out for your family and cannot afford to provide meals for a family of 5 who shows up at your doorstep. It was tacky for Chris’s family to angle for an invite for dinner. The parents are at fault here — it’s their responsibility to feed their children."
4,azbqau,t2_2n79ojvl,rescuesquad704,YTA. His parents were out of line but don’t take that out on the kid after just one incident. Your spine is shiny enough and you got them out of there with no problem even though they were basically begging. 
4,a4l295,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,NTA but be prepared for her to get tired of it and bail. You are not obligated to listen to her and/or follow her advice. She's not obligated to stay with someone whose habits she finds unbecoming. 
4,a4l295,t2_2et7shtd,AMJ_CSP,NTA.But why are you two even together??? Did you used to be healthier or is she trying to modify you from the original factory specs???
4,a4wbsd,t2_8bp1h,dudelikeshismusic,"NTA for morbid curiosity IMO. If you went out of your way and somehow got hold of the tapes through illegal means or something like that then YTA, but being interested in dark world events doesn't make you an asshole."
4,9xgcdm,t2_23k77k1q,Kyrinaki,"NTA honestly I would want to know. Your dad may even thank you one day for those photos you took, they might come in handy for court! It sounds like a bit more than a mess, it sounds like a costly bio hazard!"
4,9xgcdm,t2_2fhsdhl9,ImBadAtReddit69,"NTA. If someone did that to my house, I'd want to know. That sounds like something which could take a lot of time and effort, even money to clean and fix up. And he did ask you to check, meaning he was concerned of this. I think he was aware this was probably going to be an issue, and that the decision of what to do is on him now. If you want to help him out, go over and clean for him. You have the pictures, no use in letting shit get worse anyways."
4,b67ghb,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,"YTA if you prioritize work before your family. You requested off, it's not like you're coming in on a regular day off. If anything, it'll show your manager that your requests off don't mean anything because you'll still come in if you're needed. This is important to your wife."
4,b67ghb,t2_6r130ag,fwooby_pwow,"ESH. Your wife should compromise and move the time of the party if she can. You need to understand that if you keep bending over backwards at work, they won't promote you - they'll take advantage of you. Sometimes your family does have to come first. Your company is shitty for asking you to come in on a day you requested to take off."
4,b67ghb,t2_s2acg,Yeangster,"YTA - I personally am not a fan of the concept of giant birthday parties for one-year olds. They also seemed tacky and self-indulgent for me. That said, I feel, and your wife probably does too, that you skipping out early on this one could be a sign or set a precedent for how you prioritize work and family in the future."
4,b67ghb,t2_zmjh74j,Bangbangsmashsmash,"YTA. There will be pictures of this milestone event. You’ll be putting work above family, and if your work doesn’t understand, you need a new job. TBH, if I were your boss, I’d fee really funny about you skipping out on your family for work."
4,b67ghb,t2_g4hve,bcvickers,"NTA. I view this as putting your family first, by trying to better your position at your company, so that you can be more prepared to provide for your family. Your son isn't going to remember it in any way, shape, or form."
4,b67ghb,t2_15i4bd,Kakiston,"NTA, as long as it's not you skipping the whole thing and instead leaving early/arriving late, first birthdays are always about the parents not the kid and if you feel that this is an important opportunity then take it. A lot of people are using 'work vs family' but this is an isolated incident. "
4,ahjq4v,t2_2ar5cmws,thebligg,NTA but yeah it's a farm and a lot of odd jobs can come up. Having said that it sounds like the owners are complete pricks! I've known plenty of bosses who take advantage of their young/inexperienced workers. Get a new job if you can. 
4,ahjq4v,t2_1s7d9ktu,KingBRbill,"NTA- sounds like an employer taking advantage of someone's inexperience. Im not working one hour if the pay hasnt been explained clearly/set. Nor would I continue working for someone who threatens me in anyway, instead of proper disciplinary actions if I've done something wrong. Find a replacement job as soon as possible and move on. "
4,ba3zvb,t2_3ftpy7mt,vixenthoughts,"YTA. Being fat isn't an issue. It's a fairly innocuous adjective that unfortunately has negative connotations due to societal standards. Some fat people don't mind being called fat; others do. It's a personal preference thing. The issue isn't that your wife isn't fat but you called her fat, or that she is and you offended her. The problem here is that your buddies framed the notion of fatness as an insult, i.e. chubby chaser, and you agreed with them. The problem here is that you prioritized your reputation with your friends over defending your wife, someone you presumably plan on spending your life with. "
4,b7gf0q,t2_2iejevv1,Caurbine,YTA you allowed it? Why? 17 year old who is attracted to a 31 year old has to have some kind of issues. A 31 year old attracted to a 17 year old is a pedophile. Nobody in this situation sounds mentally healthy enough to deal with this situation 
4,an6bw0,t2_xqxzr,catcog,"NTA You were kind enough to arrange and pay for a room. They don't have to accept your offer. Lots of entitlement-thinking going on here. 1) What you said to Abby was reasonable and they could get accommodations elsewhere. Brent can stay home if other accommodations no longer exist. 2) Frank is a student too (Brent not). 3) Claire & Debby: to bad for them, but not your problem. They can still room with you; they aren't ""out"" anything except by their own choice. &#x200B; &#x200B;"
4,an6bw0,t2_1to0qqa2,MikkiTh,NTA It sounds like they should have clarified and also like they can get a room of their own if necessary. 
4,b6kwb4,t2_135zn7,tunisia3507,"If you had a blind customer, you wouldn't be waving your middle fingers at them just because you could. If you had a deaf customer, you wouldn't be whispering ""Jeez this guy's such a fucking moron"". Abusing someone's lack of ability to insult them is never nice, and is unprofessional in a customer service context. NTA."
4,b6kwb4,t2_iaefe,Chase_In_Sturgis,NTA Try firmly but politely getting your point across by speaking to her in Korean. If that doesn't put a stop to it then talk to the manager because at that point you were more than charitable.
4,b6kwb4,t2_3bm900mg,matapissu,NTA. You report her to manager if it comes down to that. Make known that you know Korean and maybe 1 embarassment will cause her to stop it. Let her know you understood what she said about you that day
4,b6kwb4,t2_2pr843c9,jrack44,NTAH. Its plain rude that she does this. Maybe she'll learn that if her boss jumps her for it. But more than likely nothing will happen. It seems to be an accepted practice...I dont even speak the language but it doesn't take much to know when someones talking about me at the nail shop I got to. 
4,b6kwb4,t2_52xi4,cybik,"NTA. As a french-speaking Québécois living in California, if I was in the same situation where a cashier was shit-talking me moments after I left, or to my face, in French because they assumed I wouldn't understand, I'd go straight to the manager to complain about it. They messed up, they haven't learned respect, and it's not your job to teach them or cuddle them."
4,b6kwb4,t2_hh9wk,notastepfordwife,"You know, I always wonder whether or not the employees at my nail salon talk shit about their customers... but then I think if they're not brave enough to tell me what they really think, they're punishing themselves. NTA, though. You know what they're saying. And it's goddamn rude. She's a face for her company, she needs to act professionally."
4,b6kwb4,t2_e78yqse,bladezwng,"NTA I once taught myself to say ""I can understand you"" in Chinese. I could tell with their looks and laughter they were mocking people where I shopped. Watching the color drain from their face was worth it "
4,b6kwb4,t2_1437ls,ReverseWho,NTA. Report her and complain about the registers being wrong for items on sale. They do it on purpose most of the time because they do not think customers pay attention at check out. False advertising.
4,avujoj,t2_8r5opn,Nonsuperstites,"NTA. You just got unlucky given the circumstance that she had some personal problems happening, she still should be called out for her previous behaviour. "
4,avujoj,t2_37kzapj9,diyarmaid,NTA. You have to value other people's time. Her bad news excuse doesn't cut it because this is something she does regularly. She could at least have the courtesy of letting you know she's going to cancel or likely to cancel beforehand. Being a regular flake is how you find yourself without any close friends. 
4,b6hbyv,t2_4xaya,aggibridges,"NTA. I think Ben needed a wake up call. I think the next step should be to take him aside and talk to him and express that you are getting increasingly frustrated by his attitude, and that you regret losing your temper. "
4,b01xst,t2_i7n41,CherubRocker89,"NTA - she told you to be yourself and let loose and that's what you did. Unless you were actively talking over her and excluding her from discussion I don't see how you would have been ""overshadowing her""."
4,b01xst,t2_dtgs2k0,madeofivory,NTA. I think it's pretty selfish of her to invite you out and tell you to be social but only to the extent that she allows. She should be more supportive of you for coming out of your comfort zone and proud for doing so well socially. 
4,b01xst,t2_yi5s13b,RusticSurgery,NTA. This is a red flag. It's possible Amy is VERY competitive with you. I've been with such a woman. It's not pretty. Just keep an eye out. Mine was not a competitive person by any means...except when it came to me.
4,b01xst,t2_7sow2wn,fjgwey,"NTA, you did what she asked, and she is being somewhat narcissistic by being angry that she isn't the center of attention. You and that guy had a common interest, and you hit it off. "
4,b01xst,t2_topkl,buddwizard,"NTA- Your GF is incredibly insecure, and knowing your social anxiety it was frankly cruel of her to say that afterwards. She should have been proud of you! People that are insecure can be mean in the moment without thinking, so maybe she will reflect on her actions and take back what she said. "
4,b01xst,t2_sphnnv,dowh4tnow,"NTA - I'm highly introverted too and in that situation would normally not talk much... if they were talking about sports or politics or any other subject I think is BS - I would just sit there, drink my drink, and stare at the wall... but if someone hit on a subject I hold dear - I will absolutely dominate the conversation, because I know all of the facts about that subject and am passionate about either changing someones view, or making sure they got their facts straight."
4,artjjm,t2_2szny3y2,knat0,"NTA. Drunk, high on weed, high on meth, it doesn't matter. Construction is dangerous by its very nature and everyone should avoid doing things that make it more dangerous. I get keeping your mouth shut as an apprentice, I was one up until a few months ago. But it doesn't matter what your position is if you are being put in unnecessary danger. Speak up for your own safety because no job is worth your life or body."
4,artjjm,t2_2z4cj0jm,IgotCarasma,"NTA Suggest to the business owner to give drug tests based on ""annual insurance compliance due to high risk situations necessary to the job"". He'll get the hint without you directly saying anything. Your safety is at risk; as is your character because he doesn't think twice about cutting corners. "
4,b0kall,t2_482ldmk,need2know25,"YTA - who cares if he ate a pancake with his hands? If there was nothing on it it's not going to crumble or cause fingerprints. And if you are actually getting upset about a wet towel being left on the floor, you really need to lighten up a bit."
4,b5lqc1,t2_25m5e68c,bullili,"NTA She can't tell you who to be friends with. I think it would be good to distance yourself from him for a bit, especially if May will be around more"
4,b5lqc1,t2_2kqzj3jn,feedbacksandwich,"NTA. Unfortunately when couples break up for whatever reason the friends have to choose sides. It's awkward, but it's life. You didn't condone Jon's behaviour. You are supporting May and your wife at least indirectly. I don't like your comments about the gun though that is a lot A. "
4,axf0ef,t2_2vt7amnh,svmc80,"NTA I live in a town where people trip over themselves to let others in first. Like ga damn it, we spent 5 minutes saying, no you go, no you first. I hate cities! "
4,axf0ef,t2_fsq9u,No_regrats,"YTA. You're being overdramatic about a totally inconsequential thing. It especially crosses the asshole line when you make the life of someone who is working an unpleasant job harder by ""calling them out"" on their normal way of doing it, just because you disagree with how things are handled here."
4,axf0ef,t2_io85id2,whippetshuffle,"NTA - it’s shitty to bust a move and try to effectively cut the line (I’m assuming that people are paying attention and would want to take the next spot). It’s also not your job to police it, though, so you’re going to come across as an ass to a decent number of people. "
4,azyhvk,t2_32ek64ix,starredandfeathered,"NTA - It really annoys me that parents think they have a right to be rude and interrupt their kids when speaking. Also he totally went overboard getting in your face like that. Sorry you had to deal with that, OP."
4,aiybxa,t2_sady3dn,Mikodite,"NTA and why would you be? Most schools on property acquisition agree that property ownership is transfered when the property is gifted away. I hate parents that do the ""I bought it so its mine"" garbage, teaching a bad lession about property acquisition. Good luck selling it."
4,ay3hi1,t2_1mmrlkec,smakchat,NTA. You were polite and let him down gently a bunch of times before you yelled to leave you alone because nothing else was working. He sounds pushy and he wouldn't be so aggressive if he cared about getting yelled at. 
4,9xssts,t2_25ttk7n5,JakesPeaches,NTA if your values and hers aren't in agreement then it makes sense to let her go. If she was abusing people she is the A.
4,am8v5w,t2_337ka3v4,skyiaso,"NTA. Depressed or not, she explicitly stated that she makes an effort to see other friends, so there is little to no interest in hanging out. So I suggest cutting ties so it doesn't keep hurting you."
4,b8ukxy,t2_235gwsy9,dreamer4523,NTA Politics and Religion are the two things that will usually start heated debates and arguments. Nothing is wrong for asking him to change subjects to talk about if they make you feel uncomfortable.
4,aputk9,t2_d3lfwgq,Jkg115,"NTA My first reaction to the title was your the a hole but context matters. You are being honest and caring. She needs to give you time to let this grow organically. Make sure she knows you care for her and that if she does, she can give you time to get there. "
4,b20eo5,t2_35937dzv,jenski1987,NTA but i am curious if her family is so well off that 10k a month is her minimum expectation why is she not living off some trust from her parents? 
4,b20eo5,t2_1402oy,TFinley97,"NTA. There’s a fine line between a “want” and a “need.” Luxuries will always fall under the “want” category since you buy them just because you can. I can understand an occasional splurge, but to consistently spend largely on the aforementioned items when finances are shared (assuming so) is where I put my foot down. Bonus NTA if it’s your money alone that’s being spent. "
4,aqf7kc,t2_znevz,CategoricallyAmazing,"NTA. She either forgot tissues or she deliberately doesn’t carry them. In the former case, she would likely be grateful for it. In the latter, it’s a gentle reminder that sniffling has a remedy and she should rethink her anti-tissue stance. "
4,asy9pq,t2_245t26j,EmmalouEsq,"NTA. Also, who gets 2 full meals? Was she taking food to go, and thus gaming the system even more? If she can't afford to pay in the rotation, she shouldn't be going out at all with the group when money is spent."
4,asy9pq,t2_6rj74,enna12,"NTA If she can't afford to eat out, she shouldn't be eating out OR she could tell you up front that she can't afford it. Then you all can make the decision to pay for her or not before you go out. If she's causing this much of an issue, maybe everyone should just start paying for their own stuff."
4,aj3app,t2_2fzqlw9r,MoonUnit98,"NTA. Cutting out toxic people never makes you an asshole. She sounds like she's making excuses for her kid too, and in no way was that a real apology. Sorry you're going through that. Take any distance you deem necessary. "
4,aej8eu,t2_11kbhn,Netflixandzzz,"YTA - when the mother of your child calls, you should assume it’s important because it’s likely concerning your son. So by choosing your friend and the inane conversation over your child’s wish to speak to you, you became the asshole. "
4,aej8eu,t2_28ikuluw,Triddian,"NTA. There's nothing wrong with talking to friends, regardless of the length. You didn't know it was your son asking for you. It could have just as easily been something insignificant, so I'd say an honest mistake on this one but definitely NTA."
4,acci3e,t2_6e093,seanfish,"NTA. He coerced you into getting an abortion against your will and couldn't even be there for the healing afterwards. You're young at 24 but he's 31 and acting like a selfish kid. If he's not into the ""demands"" that come from a person processing terminating a pregnancy, then your ultimatum was the right one to make."
4,9ypl3q,t2_d34kngn,ginger2020,"NTA. It sounds like your son is getting sucked into the Incel mindset. You want to stop him from going down this path by any means necessary. Don’t give him his computer back, or if you do, make sure that you block any websites that are amenable to Incel stuff (i.e, 4Chan). Get him some counseling and maybe a part time job if that starts to work. "
4,9ypl3q,t2_gr4eh,BlueberrieHaze,NTA. Maybe post this over on r/menslib . They can be very helpful when it comes to positive views on masculinity and I believe some of the users used to be like your son. They may be able to help you find ways to address this with him.
4,9ypl3q,t2_m52b2,Aurion7,"This seems fake, because it's hard to believe you'd destroy your kid's stuff and then unironically think that isn't bullshit. Kid's beliefs are definitely something that needs some working on. YTA, though, in a pretty massive manner. At the risk of offering unsolicited advice, get *someone else* to help get your kid right, because you obviously are not up for the task."
4,a1j5q0,t2_5w4xb,GuyNoirPI,"NTA As with many work related questions here, the answer is that you aren't the asshole for getting out of it but it may or may not be smart to do so, depending on your situation and workplace. "
4,auj823,t2_17dls4,WorstCaseAquarium,YTA. If this was such a big issue for you then you could have broken up with her instead of taking something that gives her a sense of security. Leave her alone so she can be with someone who appreciates her and her blue hoodie. 
4,am5vvx,t2_2q6y8jlo,jk10021,NTA at all. And your family and friends sound like a bunch of assholes. I have two kids. Fancy 1st birthday parties are entirely about the parents wanting to show off. The kid will never remember it and has no concept of what a birthday even is. I’d tell anyone who has a problem with your house or your decision to simply not come to the party. Edit: typos
4,am5vvx,t2_2vkt85e1,PsoriasisOfTheLiver,"NTA Your family is being incredibly rude and shallow. The money you spend on your child does not represent how much you love them. As well, feeling that your daughter will be happier and more comfortable at home is a perfectly valid reason to have a smaller party, and your family should respect that choice."
4,am5vvx,t2_fqyvp,jickeydo,"NTA at all. First of all, it's your kid. Second of all, she's 1. She will have zero memory of a party, no matter how big or small. First birthday parties have nothing to do with the kid, they have everything to do with the adults. Sounds like family attitudes are giving you a good excuse to cut back on the attendee list."
4,am5vvx,t2_12othv,AlphaBreak,"NTA. That kid's not going to remember anything. First birthdays are for the families, getting some free toys and clothes from relatives, and logging something in the scrapbook to look back on later. There's no reason to make it extravagant."
4,am5vvx,t2_g7knv1f,jolie178923-15423435,NTA >I've also heard one family member is telling other family member that I don't care enough about my daughter because putting enough effort into celebrating her 1st birthday. Leave that asshole off the guest list. Your daughter is ONE. She will not remember the party anyway.
4,am5vvx,t2_945p2,Raibean,"NTA... but neither are the people who are concerned about it being too crowded. (That one person who says you don’t love your daughter enough is an asshole though.) If your home isn’t big enough to comfortably host that many people, then don’t invite that many people or have multiple, small gatherings. "
4,andd11,t2_2urgfdhw,Erroerroerro,NTA you've been living together for three years. You have the right to know that he's going overseas FOR A MONTH and for it to be something that should at least be discussed before plans are concreted. Esp if you share finances. There was a AITA thread a month or so ago where the dude was asking almost this exact question and he was resoundingly told he was NTA so I don't understand why this is anu different. 
4,ajw65d,t2_13imw9,Brandelyn1135,"NTA Let’s get one thing straight - you can **never** be responsible for making someone else put their hands on you. Now, he owes you a huge apology, whether or not you intend to remain friends with him. If he wanted to be left alone, he should’ve made it clear. I’m sorry this happened. "
4,algye5,t2_xgwdz4n,AnthCob,"NTA. I'd make her something, or get her something cheaper, maybe clean the entirety of your house. It's a little ridiculous to expect your kids to buy you expensive gifts, while they don't have a steady income. "
4,axgfkm,t2_io85id2,whippetshuffle,"NTA. He was a prick and escalated it. Respect your elders- sure, but that doesn’t mean blindly respect and defer to someone who is being an absolute dickbag to a kid in a wheelchair just trying to get to school. Your neighbor sounds immature. "
4,axgfkm,t2_13j73z,Carliebeans,"NTA. He knows what time the bus comes. If he doesn’t want to be late, he needs to leave earlier. It’s ridiculous and unrealistic that a bus that also picks up other people should change its whole schedule for your dickhead neighbour. He had no right to be the authority on who needs a bus!"
4,axgfkm,t2_eqw0p,Thelonius16,"NTA. Ten minutes is a ridiculously long time to block the street. I would be secretly angry if that happened to me, but would just adjust my schedule. He is a Fucking piece of shit. Does he realize that if you move down the street a bit he’d still have to stop for the bus? It happens at the same time every day so it’s easy enough to adapt."
4,axgfkm,t2_59t7il9,zombiechewtoy,NTA - Buses run on a set schedule. What time he leaves for work is up to him. He can leave 5 minutes earlier. Thinks the world should prioritize him even over disabled children. He's an asshole.
4,ajth1w,t2_12lqsw,micrographia,"YTA. There are so many cases of the man retaliating when they are told someone is aborting their child (or doing something rash, verbally or physically abusive, or violent to prevent the abortion). "
4,ajth1w,t2_1rnny1gu,Kghp11,"I’m torn between ESH and NTA. Barring fear of violence, I’m of the opinion that a man has a right to know when he’s impregnated a woman, regardless of what she plans to do. He may not have a choice in what happens in this particular situation, but the information should give him pause in future encounters. "
4,afl5g8,t2_38te2rd,ChellyTheKid,"NTA he can use his laptop for work. If he wanted to check facebook or his email thats different, but I wouldn't let anybody download something on my laptop, especually not software that allows sharing of enviornments."
4,adbjpu,t2_99gcgn0,cactuspenguin,"YTA but only because of the way you described your university I'm guessing you made ""insensitive"" comments before. Hence the strong reaction. The Palestine/Israel conflict is something a lot of people feel very strongly about because it's so recent and many people are still affected by this, so you gotta be careful to make jokes on a public platform like instagram about it."
4,av4bff,t2_7lkvc1g,a-little-sleepy,YTA your question is reversed. You were the one wanting someone else to give up their chair for your group that came in later wanting to sit together. He is not the asshole for not wanting to move and had no reason to accommodate you. Especially since you didn't even ask and just assumed he should move. 
4,av4bff,t2_1s7d9ktu,KingBRbill,YTA- He has zero obligation to move for any reason. He sat at an empty table and you had every right to fill the available space. Asking someone to pick up and move to accommodate you is entitled and ridiculous. 
4,b267q0,t2_2f4pqjm,Mommy5-0,"NTA I've said it before and I will say it again BIRTH IS NOT A FUCKING SPECTATOR SPORT. They can all fuck right off and get bent. When you and your wife go in to have the baby, Register as PRIVATE and make sure NOBODY is allowed to know you are there, it doesn't matter if it's the fucking Pope. Turn off all cellphones except for your picture/memory taking phone. Congratulations and I hope your wife has a safe delivery! "
4,b267q0,t2_37kbl2td,mcthrowaway_anon,NTA! Let the hospital staff know that you are not accepting visitors including family members during the labor and post-delivery. They are supposed to keep people like your mother out. Sucks that she's trying to shoehorn herself into the situation against your wishes. 
4,b267q0,t2_336c54o3,TheCatWranglerX,"NTA- it’s already a stressful situation and this is what your wife wants. It’s understandable that they want to know and be there. But in the end it’s your decision. If they did end up showing up, and your wife tells the nurse she doesn’t want anyone in the room they will make them leave. At least in USA. "
4,b267q0,t2_jxi65,centernova,"NTA. As someone who is pregnant myself, I have made it clear to everyone that unless you are my husband or a medical professional, you don't need to be in the room when the baby is born. Anyone that doesn't understand that will be asked to leave, and if they don't listen, I'm getting a nurse to escort them out. Stick to your guns on this one, OP."
4,b267q0,t2_145n6s,EnglishTeachers,"NTA In labor, one of the Dad’s biggest jobs is running interference between Mom and Family. Follow her lead to the letter about who to notify and when - this includes calling, texting, sending pictures, and inviting people to the hospital (or not doing any of this). Do not consider the opinions of others. Labor and recovery can be very long and painful, and no one wants an audience for that. "
4,atksbr,t2_74ssx5a,DragonVT,NTA Please do what you can to prevent her from ABUSING another animal to death. This includes explaining to her mother that the dog was not cared for and that death was a result of neglect.
4,atksbr,t2_36g36qur,LivingDeadCade,"NTA and honestly fuck your roommate for this. Fuck you a little bit too though, because as much as that dog isn't your responsibility, you're seriously telling me you weren't moved to take the poor thing for a walk even once? Do not let her get another dog. Your household is not equipped to take care of one. "
4,awiyrq,t2_ohv69,Dr_thri11,"Yta, you can't decide something like that at the last minute. You live in an industrialized country with a modern healthcare system you'll be alright. "
4,b6mjur,t2_313826uk,azraminx,NTA- In my opinion you aren’t TA. You are spending significant money just to attend the wedding. The couple getting married may have a different opinion and you are running the risk of a fight with your friends. American wedding culture can be a mine field where the rules change constantly at the whim of the bride (usually) and groom. Good luck! I hope you have fun.
4,b6mjur,t2_30nyyoqb,crocky3,"NTA a gift is not a requirement, your celebrating their marriage and being supportive. Friends should be understanding if you can't afford a gift. At my wedding I didn't expect anybody to get us a gift, I invited them because I wanted them there."
4,9z7xes,t2_wmnoi,Gandalf-the-Bae,"YTA for assuming that you understand more about her situation than she does. I’ve always known that I had anxiety, even well before I was officially diagnosed with GAD. There are people who think that regular life stressors = an anxiety disorder, but this clearly seems to be affecting your friend on a deeper level. "
4,b9uwzb,t2_12og54t,jinglehelltv,"YTA. You aren't party to the transaction, you don't legally own the vehicle, nobody is obliged to do business with you or discuss their finances with you."
4,aqpujl,t2_hpmfb,ScalpelUser,"NTA And if you do go to management make sure you get a video first. Speaking from experience here, they won't do anything without 100% hard evidence. Another petty move is to leave a little gift bag on their door with baggies and a clip on poo bag dispenser. A gift for their 'gifts'. "
4,aqpujl,t2_zgijt,TemptCiderFan,"NTA, and you handled it better than I did. My neighbor did that to me once, and I walked outside, picked it up and hurled it at his front door, sans-bag. So he had this great big smear of shit on his front door and a pile of dogshit on his welcome mat. He came out, asked ""What the fuck was that for?"" and I told him that I'd return his dog's shit the exact same way any time I **found** dogshit on my yard."
4,aqpujl,t2_h3n2k92,glitterandjazzhands,"NTA - you bagged it up, so you get points for that. Everyone knows these are the guidelines (esp if there are provided bags). People who don't clean up after their pets are the worst."
4,apk6ll,t2_34ev61hz,ForgotMyNane,"YTA - A ""casual"" game of football for fun is not worth getting yourself worked up over and certainly doesn't excuse disrespect towards other players, boss or not. But your boss is probably the last person you need to blow up at. Man up and give a sincere apology. "
4,b7nj51,t2_dfevu,jelli2015,"YTA/ESH. It sounds like SE is the only one who is being a reasonable adult and trying to figure out what happened. You, EG, and the other girls need to stop acting like high schoolers and communicate. By not speaking up you are condoning EG’s actions and still choosing a side. "
4,atvjvo,t2_1ok6y57p,PterodactylHexameter,"NTA. Your mother was cruel to try to force a child to eat something they're allergic to; if she is going to continue to care for him, she needs to understand and respect his dietary restrictions. His health is at risk otherwise. "
4,atvjvo,t2_31hr9z6e,sbercher,"NTA Your mother is clearly unfit to look after a kid with allergies. And kudos to your child, you should be proud of him for being able to keep himself safe. But I am sorry you had a fallout with her. Hopefully, over time, she will understand and you will be able to trust her again."
4,atvjvo,t2_1h5samaz,psam99,"NTA Your son seems to be very cautious when the comes to his allergies, you taught him well, it could save his life in future. Your mum is a massive AH here, she's trying to make him eat something that she knows he's allergic to and doesn't care about the consequences for your son. Your son shouldn't apologise, neither should you."
4,atvjvo,t2_s19cvgn,Criticalfluffs,NTA. This needs to be the hill you will die on. The fact that she put her need to be in control over the pain and discomfort of a child is a huge asshole move. No unsupervised visits until she gets over herself. Good on you for teaching your kid to self-advocate. 
4,atvjvo,t2_plv5q,zamonie,"NTA and congratulations on your son having healthy boundaries even in a situation like this. Do absolutely not let this slide, your mom is massively overstepping boundaries here."
4,atvjvo,t2_scnpq,Icestar1186,NTA holy shit. Allergies are quite literally a matter of life and death for some people and your mother needs to understand that.
4,atvjvo,t2_hcl43,satijade,"NTA what is it with trying force kids who are allegric to eat those foods? I see these posts all the time, many time in the legal reddit. Tell her to fuck off she could have killed the kid. Would she rather have charges brought against her or an apology "
4,atvjvo,t2_kja2i40,Tarsha8nz,"NTA - I can't have raw onion or capsicum. I can have cooked, but it has to be thoroughly cooked. &#x200B; You have a 5 year old who can tell an adult what he is allergic to and refuse to eat it. That is a WIN! Seriously, the number of young children who don't really know what they are allergic to is astounding, so WTG MUM!"
4,atvjvo,t2_18o5w71o,SunshineSaysSo,"As an adult with a mild onion allergy (more severe if they're raw or being cooked, then it impacts my ability to breathe)...YOU ARE NTA! Your mother is being a danger to your son. If anyone deserves an apology it's your son."
4,atvjvo,t2_2xfr5rm5,TheMsBadger,"NTA. OP, please talk to your doctor to get ammunition. Hives means than anaphylaxis is possible. You should always assume such allergies will get worse and not better unless you do a stress test (??) at an allergist office. This may not have killed him, but it might. Your mother should apologize to your kid before he's allowed to return."
4,atvjvo,t2_1zyy0h6d,flyingokapis,"NTA. Your mum, definitely ITA. No idea how your mum has come to this conclusion, the logic is ridiculous, make a child self poison themselves for what, to win a battle of 'because I said so' and then doubled down on it after when you arrived? I'd 100% back my child for this."
4,atvjvo,t2_6x0ja,MissSwat,"NtA and good on your son for standing his ground at such a young age. Kudos to you as well for teaching him to defend his position. No one should be forced into a position where they are physically uncomfortable, let alone a child. Your mom needs to get her shit together, however. "
4,atvjvo,t2_ub2zo,miladyelle,"NTA, and your mom is a stone cold bitch more concerned with having her perceived power and authority validated than a child being safe and ALIVE. I think you calling her strict is understated, OP, and your normal meter is broken from being trained by her to believe her sick power fantasies are normal. "
4,atvjvo,t2_2pd2q10,Bluedystopia,"NTA. I think if you did make him apologise it will send a message that he should eat food he's allergic to to avoid upsetting someone, which could be dangerous. You're taking the best course of action here."
4,atvjvo,t2_uanbs,VioletPark,"NTA. Even if the allergy is only mild disconfort, your son doesn't have the obligation to endure it for your mom's ego."
4,atvjvo,t2_140wll,Abby-N0rma1,"NTA That's all I can say. Reading this was so frustrating, but I am proud of you for raising your child such that they feel confident and safe being their own advocate in the event you are not able to"
4,atvjvo,t2_1omp3f0t,inaribi,"NTA. Your kid is smart enough to know what to eat and what not to eat and she has to respect that. Even if the food allergy wasn't severe or he has medication, he's still allergic and she shouldn't push."
4,atvjvo,t2_2qwwz0a7,empressofdogs,"NTA. She is being COMPLETELY unreasonable to expect an apology from your son for protecting his health. Sometimes allergies can worsen over time, and something that previously didn't cause anaphylaxis can suddenly do so. Your mother is the only asshole here."
4,atvjvo,t2_2hbbmdu7,cztm89,"NTA - Your mother is the kind of asshole authoritarian parent that sees no fault in themselves, even when they're so clearly in the wrong. You'd be the asshole if you made your son apologize, honestly, so good to see you standing up for yourself."
4,atvjvo,t2_eld8b,Desertbell,"NTA, your mother is. Additionally, I think you should check out r/justnomil. It sounds like your mother is more problematic than you realize. You're an adult with a child, it is utterly inappropriate that your mother is maintaining a position of power over you where you feel that you have to accommodate her ""strictness."""
4,atvjvo,t2_zokjjjg,DJSparksalot,"NTA almost a shitpost/validation seeking level at that too. Who the fuck tries to force a child to eat an allergen and then demands an apology from him and his parent, presumably so she can continue to force him to eat allergens the next day."
4,atvjvo,t2_88g5c,OPtig,"NTA If you make your son apologize, it may cause him to second guess situations where he needs to stand up for himself. He took the correct actions for his own safety, and you should encourage that behavior by supporting him now."
4,atvjvo,t2_51y8so7,yyy_guy,"NTA. apologies are given when one person has wronged the other. your son did nothing wrong by refusing to eat a food that he is allergic to. in fact, your mother owes your son an apology for trying to force him to eat something that he is allergic to....and punishing him for not eating it. ugh."
4,atvjvo,t2_2jee6zbt,sunbear2525,NTA. Aside from the fact that he's allergic to it. Just seeing that aside because its super obvious. You are the parent. You already had a rule regarding the food. He was following your rule so he can't be wrong.
4,atvjvo,t2_2wv6u4dh,IntrovertedShutIn,"NTA at all! Your mother shouldn't want to feed her grandchild any food that causes a reaction, no matter how mild. You're a good parent and your son seems very mature for his age. Stick to your guns."
4,atvjvo,t2_16bm1u,Leifang666,"NTA but I would teach your child how to politely say he can't eat something. Then again, he may have done just that before things escalates out of control. As long as your mother knew he had allergies, she's in the wrong. "
4,atvjvo,t2_rsoto,eatthebunnytoo,NTA for your original question. Please never leave your kid alone with a person who will medically abuse him and then emotionally abuse him for not apologizing. Chronic allergic inflammation can increase risks of colon cancer BTW. Your mother is not safe or trustworthy and her inability to immediately beg forgiveness for her bullshit is a huge red flag.
4,atvjvo,t2_39pqu1aj,Elysium03086,NTA It's way past time we teach our kids that it's absolutely their right to say no even to adults. Kudos to you for teaching him that lesson and the backup to confidently do so.
4,atvjvo,t2_350vqyp3,ClaraElizabethCohen,"NTA. A mild reaction can easily become an anaphylactic reaction. Avoiding allergens all together is the smart way to go about it. Your mother is a total asshole for putting something she KNOWS her grandchild is allergic to in food for them. It's double the asshole level for trying to force him to eat it when he was refusing for his own health. His body, his choice."
4,atvjvo,t2_eds01,ViolentThespian,NTA and your Mom is fucking psycho. Allergies can worsen with each subsequent exposure and without warning. There's no telling which exposure could send your son into anaphylactic shock.
4,atvjvo,t2_1azaca2o,ChiefChabal,"NTA, he’s obviously more mature than the grandmother since he cared about the safety of a human "
4,atvjvo,t2_1rmvt5nu,Skeletoes8607,NTA. You taught your son to have his own voice when it comes to his health and body. Your mom should recognize that. It's not like he refused to pick up a mess or be nice to his cousins.. he refused to eat something that causes bodily harm. &#x200B; Your mom needs to chill.
4,atvjvo,t2_vf8j66p,thrownitallout,"NTA, sorry your mom doesn't understand allergies are serious business even if you don't end up needing an epipen. Side note, I laughed at the ""holey-jr"" comment - good job raising a kid who's able to advocate for his medical needs, especially at that age."
4,atvjvo,t2_2vczcg0b,gaybear63,"NTA- OP’s responsibility as mom is too protect her son from undue harm, not just from death! WTF is wrong with a grandmother who thinks no lethal harm is ok to inflict on her grandchild for absolutely no good reason ! Grandma needs to learn her place! She does not dictate the terms by which OP’s son will be raised. This is a power play and needs to be rebuffed 100%. Perhaps OP needs to pack meals from now on "
4,atvjvo,t2_s6o0fl3,InfernalAdze,"NTA, a food allergy is nothing to fuck with. If it gives him hives or any kind of minor swelling, particularly around the throat, that's fucking dangerous. You never know how severely you could react and repeated exposure can make it much worse. (Edit: forgot an S)"
4,atvjvo,t2_2zf8cvzp,Macmama811,NTA at all your mom is being one for sure ESPECIALLY because your poor son is allergic to the food..why would she even cook him something that has an off limits food in it?
4,atvjvo,t2_10jqci,beccimaria,NTA. What your son eats is none of her business. It doesn't need to be an allergy to say he can't have something. No means no. Well done to your son for being confident in saying that. Obviously he associates whatever it is to feeling sick. 
4,atvjvo,t2_1qkdksp2,oops_itwasme,"NTA, unless your mum was unaware of his allergies. In which case NAH and you need to explain to her why your son wouldn't eat the food. Otherwise she's essentially trying to force your child to knowingly poison himself and that's not okay"
4,b5x6fk,t2_1cz04anu,Illumnyx,"NTA. You need time to destress and unwind from the working week too. If she's that worried about them being alone on weekends, she can hire a sitter for when you're not there."
4,b5x6fk,t2_1qnw7krb,TheRubberMeep,NTA she took the job she wasn't forced into it and those are ridiculous hours to work . Also 14 and 15 year olds can go to bed on their own . They arnt four year olds.
4,b6xp4k,t2_q808n,Germahy,"NTA. Cut ties with them and move along. They are a toxic group of people that you don’t want to be around. They blame you for things that they do. Also in the future, never do something for someone that could negatively affect your credit score (co-signing a car etc). It usually ends badly. "
4,b6xp4k,t2_wily2,StorminWolf,NTA. That sounds like toxicity par excellence. They seem like complete narcissists. I recommend you have a look at r/raisedbynarcissists. Don’t let them gaslight you into feeling guilty. And also do not get into any financial or business commitments with anyone in your family.
4,b2dns5,t2_5dqsu,SockofBadKarma,"NTA The child's safety is paramount, and your father is clearly a jackass. If he can't take care of the kid(s), then they need to be with someone who can."
4,aoddd9,t2_m52g11m,The_Real_Flatmeat,YTA. I've never even been to a gym and I know you need to clean up after yourself. Spend the 5 lousy bucks on some cleaning supplies. It's better than however much a month a gym membership costs ffs
4,aoddd9,t2_5mow4,Lordica,"YTA- but not a huge one. If everyone who used it bought a thing of wipes everyone could keep the equipment clean. When we are lucky enough to be provided a free amenity, it behooves us to take care of it- that way, we can have nice things. "
4,aoddd9,t2_gox0o,glorioid,"YTA mildly. Buy some Clorox wipes for the gym bag, bring a towel to work, and figure out who's in charge of this fungal farm so you can have a chat with them and innocently ask how you are expected to keep the equipment clean. This is a free resource, you can handle the negligible effort."
4,aoddd9,t2_4tpk5,sjsyed,"YTA. And you’re gross. You’re the one who made the equipment dirty, you need to be the one to clean it up. Just think of the cost of the cleaning supplies as the fee for using the gym (which would still be dirt cheap. You can get cleaning supplies for a dollar, for goodness sake.)"
4,aoddd9,t2_10ngu3,j_bgl,"NTA. But google ringworm, impetigo, and molluscum. I imagine after that you will probably either be bringing your own cleaning supplies or getting proactive in requesting some from whoever is in charge of the gym. "
4,ajfh1z,t2_jdgr6,Tyrinn,"NTA, but I don't think it's discrimination. Leasing companies like this try to take advantage of everybody regardless. The explanation is that they were trying to make a fast buck but in my opinion, you won't get any satisfaction pursuing it. Put a complaint in about them if you have a legislative board where you live but don't expect anything "
4,ax7h5u,t2_17ei81zn,tessah22,"NTA. Your completely dependent upon this guy, who had effectively made you his indentured servant from the sounds of it. Nothing about this sounds healthy. "
4,b9zrc4,t2_io85id2,whippetshuffle,"NTA, and normally I'd never say this when someone's talking about asking their partner to cut someone out of their life, but given the history between them and her continued commentary, it's not surprising you want her out of your lives."
4,at0h5c,t2_39npmjuk,Logical_Marsupial,"NTA. You're trying to adult (and good on you for it), and it doesn't seem like she fully understands that. However, she might have reacted strongly because she's taking it personally, so I would reiterate that you visiting less has nothing to do with you liking her less and everything to do with your financial situation."
4,arnjb9,t2_32lo91xm,SparklyBoat,"NTA for wanting to split the bill. I've always felt if I had a great time and want to see them again, I'll pay. If not, we're splitting. YTA for dropping the cash and just running though. "
4,arnjb9,t2_1cd6mlxe,qbb_beauty,NTA but both parties should always have enough money to cover the full bill. Splitting the bill is fine but it’s bad form not to carry enough to pay it if something happened.
4,apcskx,t2_j06x9,JDDJS,"NTA. If you were just upset about them not posting about your engagement on social media, I would say that you're being petty. However, the fact that they are actively posting about your brother's engagement changes things, and while they might not mean for it to come off this way, can give you the impression that they like him and/or his fiance more than you and/or your fiance. "
4,apcskx,t2_27y3pcou,throwmyballoons,"NTA. My family is like that too. All the hullabaloos and congratulations towards my brother and SIL, none for me and my husband. It hurt after awhile, but all the more reason to cut them out of my life someday. "
4,b1zz1x,t2_ag2j8,mastermoebius,"NTA at all. Although Samantha should not be immaturely gossiping and is an asshole for it, she did just hear the one side of the story and so erroneously blames you, the real asshole of course is the ex. "
4,b393hd,t2_g749h,CO420Tech,NTA - dogs are separate beings and can be trained but not perfectly controlled. You picked it up and fulfilled the social contract successfully. What else could you have done? Put your hands under your dog and caught it as it fell?
4,b0kk0a,t2_21mo3yfx,wwwooowwwzzzaaa,"NTA Don't let them make you out to be the villain. They knew they shouldn't have brought the dog home in the first place. It's shitty they had to return it, but again that was their fault."
4,b0kk0a,t2_1hbqmtht,Master_Sosuke,NTA they got the puppy knowing you were allergic and without discussing it with. It's 100% disrespectful and you should find yourself another apartment as soon as the lease ends
4,b0kk0a,t2_dn9au,Swiollvfer,"NTA. It's a pity to separate dogs that are getting along so well, but he asked about it you said you would talk about it later, and then they just brought it without permission. It's not your house only, and if it didn't affect you I would say 100% you were the asshole, but this does affect you and I'm guessing your roomies know about it..."
4,b0kk0a,t2_1acbkrnx,MountainLou,NTA Even if you weren't allergic they shouldnt have got the dog when you asked them not to. especially as all they had to do was wait a couple of months for you to leave.
4,b0kk0a,t2_29gj44mi,fatherofallthings,"NTA. You have the right to say if you want a dog living with you. You pay rent, and dogs don’t work for your they should’ve totally talked to you about it and come up with a plan that worked for everyone. "
4,b0kk0a,t2_656xz,TalkingBackAgain,"NTA You had had the conversation, they said they weren’t going to do it, then did it anyway. If you’re going to be leaving soon, they can wait those couple of weeks before getting another dog."
4,b2bqx9,t2_1u1h50f2,piximelon,"NTA. It sounds like you’re trying to make compromises, and it’s your house too if you live there and contribute. “It’s too much work” is a terrible reason not to redecorate. If he said he didn’t like your ideas, that would be different, but he just doesn’t want to put in the effort. "
4,a2kbnz,t2_y6gk1,TheSpanishKarmada,NTA and it's also kind of bs that tips get pooled if you're always working the busiest one. Can you request that your tips are kept separate? 
4,awcw3c,t2_2veyqqiz,Aredhela_,"NTA - that’s not your burden to bear. If anything, if he has a disability and your parents can no longer take care of him, he needs to go to a group home and become a ward of the state."
4,awcw3c,t2_bjo2w,BlackCaaaaat,"NTA He sounds like an abusive person, and you definitely don’t deserve the hassle of putting your life on hold for him. Even if he was a great brother, it’s not your responsibility. Your parents need to stop trying to push this on you and start preparing him now for what happens when they can no longer care from him."
4,awcw3c,t2_1xki7e50,steamed_pork_bunz,"NTA, at all. You have a right to set whatever boundaries you want to with your brother, and with your parents. You owe them nothing, and you deserve whatever distance you want from all of them. Your story reads a lot like mine, by the way."
4,awcw3c,t2_k2497ik,AceyAceyAcey,"NTA If you loved him and were close with him, this could be a really sweet thing to do for him. But if he’s legally competent then you are not required to care for him, and it’s your parents’ job to teach him to take care of himself. Perhaps you could find some way to split the difference and you could start helping teach him to be independent — otherwise then when your parents pass he may come crawling to you anyway. "
4,awcw3c,t2_1acbkrnx,MountainLou,"NTA There are option out there which are less than being in a care home and give people more independence. If yous parents thinks he needs to live with someone then he'll surely qualify. They want their adult life back a bit, I get that, but that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice yours and be a nurse at home and at work."
4,awcw3c,t2_3a6a0fra,Musashi10000,"NTA. You're responsible for yourself, and nobody else. Are you sure he ONLY has auditory processing disorder? I have auditory processing disorder. I also have ADHD. Apart from the ADHD, I don't have any serious issues. ADHD is a spectrum disorder, sure, and can be quite debilitating for a lot of people (in certain ways it is for me) but CAPD is really just like dyslexia for your ears. It makes things harder, sure, but it doesn't have any effect on your actions or personality."
4,awcw3c,t2_1e2krssr,bigrottentuna,"NTA — You are under no obligation to take on that burden. If you don’t want to do it, don’t do it. Your reasons are good, but they don’t really matter. It’s your life and you get to decide what to do with it, It is understandable that your parents want to make sure their other son gets the care he needs, but it is unfair of them to expect you to take it on."
4,amj73s,t2_2t2g1d8v,bubbalooski,"NTA, you just want a space you feel secure in and that you feel is yours and isn’t invaded. I’d (calmly and rationally) bring it up to your mom again with the reasons you listed (minus the jacking off part)."
4,a9eard,t2_kvs6u,sarah-goldfarb,"NTA. I would say that you should bite the bullet and change your job instead, but the last line of your post is a valid reason why you can't. I think it's generally wrong to screw someone over in retailation no matter how much they've hurt you, but Christ, she is on another level. "
4,a9eard,t2_2n4q22oj,callmelola32,NTA. I don't care if someone has a mental illness like bipolar physical violence is inexcusable! She was your abuser. She gave you black eyes 3 times in one month and mentally abused you as well. She is now harassing and threatening you. You need to take all of her messages and go to the police. Get a no contact order and restraining order. Tell them about the abuse and get it on record. 
4,a9eard,t2_2ji4sfs6,Ladyx1980,Nta for reporting her change of address. Kind of the asshole for expecting her to take a pay cut that you're not willing to take yourself
4,b4mk4p,t2_1hiohu6p,whamanraman,"NTA You broke up, and he kept the cats. To me it seems that visiting them (and by extension him) is also doing damage to you emotionally and mentally. Please take care if yourself first ❤"
4,b4mk4p,t2_d1eb4,CheeryPie,"INFO If you're still in touch with the ex and are amicable, why are you no longer able to see the cats? What was the situation? It seems absurd though, and absolutely not true that you don't care. One could argue you care too much, and that's why you have detached yourself completely. But if it's taking such a toll on your mental health, I would consider therapy if that's an option. "
4,9u310p,t2_276cprat,Space2Bakersfield,"I agree with you that Christmas gets oversaturated in October and November and that ultimately devalues it as a holiday, but YTA for being so uptight about what your 4 year old wants to wear. She wasn’t hurting anyone. "
4,b73t6k,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,"NTA. It sucks that he's getting divorced, but your family comes first. He and his girlfriend are grown ups, so he can find a room somewhere else while he gets back on his feet."
4,b73t6k,t2_2dr62172,Different_Tailor,NTA because he asked to stay with you for a couple of MONTHS. If your best friend needs a place to stay for a week while going through a divorce and you have a spare bedroom you should let him stay.n But asking for a couple of months is too much. 
4,b73t6k,t2_j9dmt,Quotetheunquotable,NTA. By the sounds of it he hasn't been much of a friend to you this past year! Under the circumstances you are in no way TA for refusing someone who would just make your (and your wife's) life miserable for who knows how long! 
4,b8dw7z,t2_j9afo,Salt-Pile,YTA you have no relationship with them and barely know them. You have no entitlement to be lent money by them. Go to a bank and get a personal loan.
4,b8dw7z,t2_a4sue,SoMuchMoreEagle,"YTA. It even sounds like she was considering helping you, but you didn't have a thought-out plan to pay them back. Maybe offer to set up a weekly payment plan and pay them back with reasonable interest. Show them you are taking it seriously and are trying to be responsible. If not, could you find a place with a roommate? "
4,afvqlc,t2_10ry1o,cbankert5,Idec if I get downvoted. NTA I hope every single person here saying YTA has this happen to them so they have to reflect on this actually having been in your shoes. Jesus.
4,afvqlc,t2_16z5g7,BananaFrappe,"YTA. Neither your friend nor your ex have any obligation to stay apart just becaue you are friends with the former and dated the latter. You don't own her. Seriously, grow up."
4,aqgu6i,t2_doqtb,MadoogsL,NTA He needs some help. I hope you realize the weed is just self medication for deeper underlying problems that clearly surface in his irrational behavior and rage threats... 
4,aqgu6i,t2_11h517,Calliope719,"NTA. however, sounds like your friend has some serious mental health issues that have nothing to do with marijuana. Also, no one calls it a ""bong shot"". You can lead a horse to water..."
4,aar77b,t2_7gj53,SucculentFire,"NTA. I would put it in your room for the week though if possible. When I had little cousins over growing up they always broke my stuff. Also, its your property you can determine who uses it and when. "
4,aar77b,t2_994jo,thiscouldbemassive,"NTA, but only because #3 saves your ass. Tell his parents you don't have any games that are appropriate for a 7 year old and all your games are violent shooters. They can be the bad guys and say ""no"" to their kid. Also tell them that you'd prefer not to have him use your things since they are fragile, just in case they get an idea to buy the kid a G rated game to play on your system."
4,b67daz,t2_1r6b8ht2,Tigercatzen,"NTA Your stepfather is an ass for pulling the ""take it up with my lawyer card."" If you can't afford to go, then don't. Make sure family understands, and then grieve how you need to."
4,b54zgt,t2_gvrycsn,HanabinoOto,YTA Get some audiobooks and enjoy the ride. Kids need to believe that their parents would move mountains for them. It makes them feel safe and is the foundation of their confidence as adults. Kids who feel worthless become depressed and unstable.
4,b54zgt,t2_9oash,theoptionexplicit,"YTA - I once had a job where I commuted 2 hours each way for 5 days a week. It was painful, but not impossible. 200 miles on a weekend is not the end of the world if it's for your own child."
4,a29xtv,t2_1sw5ctat,lamesituation,NTA these aren't your kids. You need to have a discussion with your roommate about the fact you don't have enough money to be buying for both your family and hers. Also I don't know of any kids who expect presents from their parents friends or roommates. 
4,aq2320,t2_b9ndflx,Pigeoncoup234,"EHS - sounds like this person is having some serious mental health issues. It makes sense to want to lash out, but its not the right thing to do. Try not to take all of this personally, it honestly sounds like this person is really going through something."
4,a6hpez,t2_16z5g7,BananaFrappe,"NTA. A vacation is something that is supposed to be enjoyable. If your mother invites someone that you do not like, you have no obligation to spend time with that person. "
4,ajpvtp,t2_2jnvmzip,StarsLikeLittleFish,NTA but I'd actually probably just leave it in a wet pile instead of putting in the dryer because sometimes some things need to be hung or laid flat to dry properly and you don't know the proper care for all the clothing in that load. Unless it was just towels or something.
4,ajpvtp,t2_2mpfcq6a,LadyCass79,"NTA In shared machines moving their stuff to the dryer if they are not attending it in a timely manner is reasonable. They might be mad though. If so, they are the asshole. If they don't come back by the time you are ready to dry then you just move yours to the dryer and theirs back to the washer. &#x200B;"
4,ajpvtp,t2_yj4o8,PM_TITS_OR_DONT,"NTA. Two things here: 1. Putting them IN the dryer is fine, but don't run the dryer, that can ruin some clothes. And 2. If there's no open dryer, feel free to pile the clean wet clothes on top of one of the machines or on a table in the room somewhere, or in a laundry basket if someone has left one behind. "
4,ajpvtp,t2_3wvxcmu,Thyperson08,"NTA they should be moor attentive to their laundry so the facility can be used by all tenants. They can be butthurt all they want, but no, don't dry them."
4,a5j2x6,t2_fro2a,grog189,NTA - You've tried to resolve it peacefully and they refuse to do anything about it. Hearing impaired or not if they are disturbing others then you have every right to complain. 
4,a5j2x6,t2_wpdkte3,CitizenSquidbot,"NTA, it doesn't matter what the situation is, you still need to be able to sleep. The leasing office isn't going to kick them out over one complaint. They'll talk to them about the issue, and see if a solution can be reached. If your neighbor refuses to accommodate her neighbors, then she shouldn't be living in an apartment. Most apartments set quiet hours for just this reason. We all have to live here together, don't be jerk to those you share walls with."
4,a5j2x6,t2_1233xn,kerodon,NTA You already made multiple peaceful attempts. And you mentioned you don't have the financial freedom to purchase them some hearing aid devices or something for their tv/music so kind of your only option. You could also try speaking to the landlord first? 
4,a5j2x6,t2_oofne,Ovenproofcorgi,NTA Most complexes have rules in place where you can't be loud past a certain specifically for these reasons. If the neughbor is hearing impaired they should either turn on captions or get a hearing aid.
4,a5j2x6,t2_1bdqders,DerHoggenCatten,NTA - Your neighbor needs to use headphones in the evening and at night. Your neighbor can still hear without making it hard for you to sleep. The fact that she hasn't done this already means she's taking advantage of her disability to do what she wants no matter how much hassle it is for others.
4,a5j2x6,t2_111o2n,IncredibleGonzo,"You probably would be if you'd gone straight to reporting them, but seems like you've put reasonable effort into trying to resolve it with the neighbor and they're seemingly unwilling to cooperate. NTA."
4,ba5yf8,t2_ohv69,Dr_thri11,"NTA, he obviously placed a low value on the items and priced them accordingly. As a fan of guns myself I'm just thinking wtf on that M1 garand. You can't usually buy a beat-up hunting rifle for that. I get he might not have realized just how valuable it was, but you'd think he would knows guns are typically more expensive than that."
4,ba5yf8,t2_1gnlaf4,Repulsive_Icon,"NTA Regardless for how the neighbor acts towards you, he was selling that stuff at a yard sale. You paid the price that he asked, which was more than he thought they were worth. Due diligence is important, and if you fail to do it, then it's on you. Your neighbor likely won't be able to convince an attorney to take this case. As a friendly gesture I'd let the Uncle and Neighbor know you're willing to sell the M1 at a discount, say...75% of fair market?"
4,ba5yf8,t2_e9ya4,lisavollrath,"NTA. A deal's a deal, and the time for your neighbor to do his research about the value of what he was selling was before you bought it."
4,ba5yf8,t2_1r6b8ht2,Tigercatzen,"NTA If he wanted proper value, he should have bothered to look it up. Rejoice, for karma has come a calling. EDIT: *Maybe* for the sake of family heirloom, sell it to the guy's uncle. Or, give it to the uncle in exchange for jackass neighbor stopping the harassment. Up to you, though. It's not something you remotely *need* to do."
4,ba5yf8,t2_hsmto,avast2006,"NTA - he set the prices himself, and he was openly snickering about how he was taking total advantage of the rube he was selling them to. He can hardly complain that you paid what he asked."
4,ba5yf8,t2_is426,pmw1981,"NTA - if he wasn't smart enough to look up the value, it's his loss. With the amount of information available nowadays, he could've done a 5 minute online search & sold them to a collector or through an auction. He's an idiot, let him keep thinking he scammed you & either keep the coins or auction them yourself for what they're actually worth."
4,ba5yf8,t2_34jixi3m,boredomisoverrated,"NTA. He should of at least researched the items if selling them, he didn't care until he realized they were worth more. He can't do anything about it, he'salready sold it. Make sure to block all contact with them, and if they keep harassing you seek legal advice. "
4,ba5yf8,t2_t0gra,Rivka333,"NTA. If he failed to check the value of antique items that he was selling, that's on him, not you. Heck, he got the money for them that he wanted-at the time he was happy about that, nothing's changed for him."
4,ba5yf8,t2_zj4m3,A_Redheads_Ramblings,NTA If he was too lazy to do his research then it's on him. You paid him the price he asked fair and above board. He can go piss in the wind if he's got seller's remorse now.
4,ba5yf8,t2_icgzt,LordJiraiya,NTA. didn’t read anything past the title. If he’s going to list a price for something at a yard sale that’s his own fault if it’s way less than the actual value.
4,ba5yf8,t2_jnhli,thelastestgunslinger,"NTA. You have no obligation to give him anything back. He chose the price, and sold it to you. The sign of a good deal is when both buyer and seller walk away happy. That happened. Later, he learned that he made a mistake. That isn't on you. He can take that as a lesson learned and do better pricing next time. Nothing to see here."
4,ba5yf8,t2_xw5ny,fuzzyoctopus97,"NTA, you paid for them fair and square, he’s got no case, basically any lawyer would laugh in his face, it’s now in your possession and he’s got no right to it whatsoever, even if he was a decent person you wouldn’t have to give it back, his personality has nothing to do with his."
4,ba5yf8,t2_2bd3iysd,Dogismygod,"NTA. He set the prices, he failed to do even basic research on what he was selling, so he reaps the rewards of his laziness."
4,ba5yf8,t2_2pgr785i,kingramennoodle2,"NTA. if he wanted a fair price he should have done his due diligence, no excuse in the age of the internet to not look up going rates for items. Also if he wanted you to give him a heads up about stuff like that he should have been a nicer neighbor."
4,ba5yf8,t2_2wv6u4dh,IntrovertedShutIn,NTA. Know the value of what you're selling and don't be an ass to your neighbors. Those are lessons he needed to learn. Hold on to ALL evidence of this transaction and the communication that's followed. Use it in the event he does get a lawyer.
4,ba5yf8,t2_e11cf,imawin,"NTA - If he's not a family member or a friend, you have no business telling him his items are worth more than what he's selling them for. Even if he wasn't a complete asshole, you did nothing wrong here."
4,a822ym,t2_fqz0l,thesweetestpunch,"YTA. For most cultures, refusing food is considered very rude. Offering food is a big way to show appreciation to somebody; having it refused hurts. Western caginess around food isn’t really normal. Someone went to great effort to make it and bring it over; unless you have a dietary reason to refuse, it doesn’t hurt to grab a plate and swallow a few bites. "
4,a822ym,t2_ktgzk,sublingualfilm8118,"NTA - But goat is really delicious. I was suprised myself, because I was initially sceptic, but thought that it wouldn't hurt to taste it. And it's really a treat. Not knowing anything other then the information you provided, I assume that's why they asked. Because it was delicious, and they were suprised you passed on it."
4,aongpg,t2_6rj74,enna12,"NTA You didn't double book. Double booking is when the plans overlap. In this case, they didn't. You were going out with your friends after dinner. That's not a big deal. Sounds like the mom overreacted."
4,aolx0v,t2_udmac,Hunterofshadows,"NTA Aspergers can make it difficult for people to understand social norms but not impossible.

And by the way, I’m a veteran spinner and spinning instructor and nothing bothers me more than people trying to chat with me during any workout, but especially spinning.

4,almfgo,t2_21ci7nx,nokittythatsmypie,"NTA that guy sounds like a dick. He was talking down to you about your effort level. And not taking to someone while they are working out is a rule. He doesn’t get to make his own personal rules, useless he owns the gym. Fuck that guy. "

He refuses to respect your boundaries and blames you/makes you feel badly about yourself when you make reasonable requests. He also allowed his friends and family to treat you badly. These are big red flags. Dump him.
4,b013kq,t2_231p3p6b,sfle05,NTA. His desire for affection isn't the issue; it's the fact that he refuses to honor your wishes and respect your boundaries. All of the requests you've listed are more than reasonable.

There may be an issue stopping sex that she isn’t talking about right now, and communication is key. "
4,a8xu19,t2_2hpp19wh,esscuchi,"NTA I was initially tempted to say YTA, but it's clear that you don't feel entitled to sex. You're just let down by the fact that your GF discussed lingerie but nothing didn't really happen.

4,b5wx1t,t2_xv636,ex-inteller,"NTA. If you're in the USA, it's against federal law to prevent you from speaking whatever language you feel like at work. In my area, this recently happened with a business that said workers couldn't speak to each other in spanish while at work. https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/immigrants-facts.cfm Relevant text: ""Speak-English -Only Rules The EEOC has stated that rules requiring employees to speak only English in the workplace violate the law unless the employer can show that they are justified by business necessity. A rule requiring employees to speak only English in the workplace at all times, including breaks and lunch time, will rarely be justified. An English-only rule should be limited to the circumstances in which it is needed for the employer to operate safely or efficiently. Circumstances in which an English-only rule may be justified include: communications with customers or coworkers who only speak English; emergencies or other situations in which workers must speak a common language to promote safety; cooperative work assignments in which the English-only rule is needed to promote efficiency. Even if there is a need for an English-only rule, an employer may not take disciplinary action against an employee for violating the rule unless the employer has notified workers about the rule and the consequences of violating it."""

4,b5wx1t,t2_bq5qu,NexVestri,"NTA - Speaking a language should never be considered being an asshole, especially since everyone is free to learn any language they would like. If the language has such a large presence in the community, it would make more sense for the manager to try and pick a little up than try and ban it."
4,b5wx1t,t2_3cifv4oj,Rabid-Sqrl,"NTA they are. I only speak English but I think others who get upset about this are projecting their insecurities, so they limit diversity. I think it's borderline discrimination to require you to speak English even if you are on the clock."
4,b5wx1t,t2_1h5samaz,psam99,"NTA > Something about political sensitivities of other workers That's bs, political sensitivities is just their excuse for allowing the racist attitudes of some workers. What political sensitivities can you infringe upon when they don't even know what is being said? The only 'politcal' reason they would have a problem with it is if they didn't like Russians/immigrants which isn't a political insensitivity, that's just racism."
4,b5wx1t,t2_10x39c,molly__pop,"NTA - I do think it's obnoxious to speak in a language that excludes those around you if you all speak a common language, but I do get that if English is some of their second language, they'd feel more comfortable communicating in Russian.

They should have systems in place for this. If they don't, they need to get you somewhere that can accommodate your needs. >Over the past two years they've been letting me do my tests in other rooms, no questions asked.

4,b8wwib,t2_35832jcz,Jasper_J_Jones,"YTA you obviously DON'T KNOW the process of assessing children to see if they require extra time, scribes, separate rooms, laptops etc, so who are you to tell people they are not doing their jobs???!! No one, is the answer to that. Just because you go to school, doesn't mean you know what it takes to become a teacher, and just because you have autism, doesn't mean you know how the special educational needs system works! You see, some children, who have conditions, do not need extra time, a separate room. If you did need it, the school WOULD MOST DEFINITELY ensure you get it, as it would benefit their results data. Perhaps, you, although you are autistic, are perfectly capable of being in main stream school, without needing extra help?

If they are doing their jobs they will evaluate her based on evidence, not just your say so. That said, she almost certainly has tenure, and the process of getting rid of her would be very hard. Likely, you'll just be ignored."
4,b29i7w,t2_5w5wl,nkdeck07,"NTA but it's also unlikely anything is gonna get done, she's probably got tenure and will retire in a few years so the school is just gonna ignore the problem."

Pro-tip : you are the only one who can work at those time because as long as they have you and can overwork you, why would they hire someone else ? Though I’m surprised no manager is available at those times. It’s stupid on their part because if you had an accident or got sick they would have no one to cover for you, but that’s their problem. "
4,b1p9n7,t2_125nes5q,luther1483,"NTA. Employment works because you sell your time to the employer. Both parties aggree on what is being bought/sold.

Drivers take into account their confidence behind the wheel, their specific vehicle, the conditions of the road, so on and drive at the highest speed at which they’re comfortable driving. On a wide open highway, 65 is pretty slow. In some states, the highway speed limit is as high as 85 mph (Texas). So, people are speeding past you because 1) they feel confident enough to do so safety and possibly 2) because they’re used to driving a lot faster on highways."

4,b64tgf,t2_fij24,bobsnavitch,NTA. I think its kinda hilarious but at the same time they shouldnt have done it. If they did a good job otherwise i would just tell them that i am deducting from the payment since you had to actually clean the bathroom yourself.

4,aw7rpq,t2_nwgcx,somesnazzyname,NTA- you should have been told before the date. They kept this from you and that wasn't fair and being pushed into that situation at 22 I'd probably not have the social skills to handle this any better than you.

Sure, it COULD have been handled better, but I doubt I (or many others) would have done better.

4,aw7rpq,t2_ar0hxp,KyroNoHane,"NTA. Being in a wheelchair is a pretty fucking bigdeal. They both performed lying through omissions.

4,a1v1ph,t2_2gtkjui4,liptonthrowback,"NTA. You're backing out early and I'm sure there's someone else who will be happy to take the part. I would consider calming down and taking the Coach role instead, though. Not because you owe it to the directors, but because it is your last year to participate and because you'll enjoy spending time with your cast-mates."
4,a1v1ph,t2_2fc7pmk2,Vulturedoors,NTA. This is highly inappropriate for the adults in charge of this play. You and your sister are teenagers ffs. Having you be a romantic couple in a play is all kinds of pervy and ridiculous.

4,aorwnz,t2_tcwbi7,brandyto,"YTA. Your wife needs your support, not additional stress. Her body, her medical procedure, her call as to who is in the room. She ultimately has the legal right to have her dad in the delivery room, so what do you actually accomplish having this argument? I understand why you don’t want her father there, but you’ve made your feelings known. Your wife has decided to include her dad anyway. Continuing this argument is a no win situation that only adds stress to a very stressful time."
4,aorwnz,t2_iccjf,SykCyn,"YTA, but not a complete asshole. It's nice that you're looking out for the well-being of your wife, that's really sweet. However, I'm sure she knows about how he speaks to her and in the same way I feel about abortion, it's her body and her choice."
4,aorwnz,t2_3iqwc0r,ShadsDR,YTA. You have no right for telling her who she can or can not have accompany her when she is the one giving birth which can be life-threatening.
4,aorwnz,t2_1dk456sv,Lostmylogininfoagain,"Why am I always at odds with the commenters? NTA - kinda ESH &#x200B; It's her body and procedure yes. It's your baby too.

(I can't spell belittering) &#x200B; again it's her body, but your baby too. …. compromise. "
4,b32ymu,t2_2bpuuiv0,inevitablegirlie,"YTA. I started off as ESH but as I wrote this I changed my mind. You certainly have the right to be pissed about her taking your boyfriend's side, but this seems like a wildly disproportionate revenge, especially since I get the sense from this that you knew this was going to cause a lot of trouble for her. There's a difference between high school drama and genuine life-changing consequences, and you've responded to the former with the latter."
4,ak0zkc,t2_c00cm,EstherandThyme,"Yikes, YTA. The non-asshole way to do what you did would be to say ""Excuse me, I'd love to give some positive feedback to your manager if they are available,"" not dangle the idea that you were going to make a complaint in front of that poor minimum wage worker's face. You were showboating. It was more of a stunt than a genuine compliment and I wouldn't be impressed either if I was your date. Edit: I wonder if you are also the kind of guy who would pull the ""five singles on the table"" act..."
4,ak0zkc,t2_3w3z812,Originalwookie,YTA not for doing it but for how you did it that poor girl was probably terrified that you were going to say something bad because 99.99% of people only ask for the manager to bitch.
4,ak0zkc,t2_1o6a3g18,SquareVehicle,YTA if only because you seem to think that good listening is a rare quality. That says an epic amount about how you see other people in your life. And of course the asshole move of making a server freak out for your amusement. You gotta work on yourself. 
4,ak0zkc,t2_4tg8gns,mebetiffbeme,"YTA. If you genuinely wanted to compliment her, your execution was all wrong. When you asked to speak to her manager, and she asked if something was wrong, you should have let her know then and there that nothing was wrong. Instead, she probably went to get her manager while stressing out about what she could have possibly messed up. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_dhky2fp,KuhBus,"YTA - To your date and probably the waitress you definitely looked like you were first planning on complaining and then it just looked like you were showing off. Your intentions don't matter when your actions come across as a giant douchebag. Also, if you enjoyed the service, *leave a tip*."
4,ak0zkc,t2_ht5ioo3,Miimmoouuu,"Yeah, YTA big time. You stressed that poor girl out for no reason, completely ruining the entire point of the compliment. Happy that your date saw through the entire thing. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_rsatckk,NoCornflakeGrrrrl,YTA - and your date is probably glad to have seen it so soon. I was cringing hard while reading it. I think get off on control and manipulation. 
4,ak0zkc,t2_98tx6,Lv16,"I don't quite understand why your date took personal offense to it, but your approach with the waitress was certainly not the best. Keeping someone in an anxious emotional limbo is an awful thing, especially when your intention is to speak highly of them. You do your own compliment a disservice when the person feels relief more than they feel anything else. I wouldn't necessarily say YTA but, dick move."
4,ak0zkc,t2_1bl0fech,colakingpotato,NTA like what the fuck is wrong with giving a God damn compliment to the dude in charge in fact what he was doing had nothing to do with his date
4,ak0zkc,t2_wilqq,AnHan07,"I’m gonna go against the grain here, NTA. I think you could have handled the situation a little more tactfully, but overall, I appreciate what you we’re trying to do and I think it was a nice sentiment. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_bc5l1,Ekkkoe,"Okay, reconsidered, YTA. Not to the date, but to the waitress. She's a human being who tried hard to do a good job and you treat her like she's your personal servant or something... Get off your high horse dude. In general, but especially in a fucking burger joint. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_nq24kem,Fehinaction,"NTA for telling the manager the waitress is great, but YTA for emotionally manipulating the person you wanted to compliment and speaking rudely to her"
4,ak0zkc,t2_zd93d,Philiperix,"More often than not i have to disagree with this sub when it say YTA. But this time i gotta say YTA. Not a big one, but more of the eyerolling kind of asshole."
4,ak0zkc,t2_6mjsm,v650,"YTA, Jez just leave a damn tip and if you have to compliment them then call the restaurant later and tell the manager or better yet if they are online and have those little surveys to fill out, then do that. No need to stress out the waitress. That's a dick move. "

4,ak0zkc,t2_2bpaooq7,EmperorJangles,"NTA. I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt that you weren't trying to stress out your server. You definitely could and should have handled giving your server feedback better, but now you know for the future."
4,ak0zkc,t2_14mam7,seviay,"I am erring toward YTA bc of the pomposity and arrogance with which you asked to speak to the manager. Your girlfriend was right to call you out on that, and for that reason, your girlfriend is even more worthy of your pursuit. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_t0gra,Rivka333,"YTA >and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. Why the heck didn't you respond by saying ""nothing's wrong, I just wanted to give some positive feedback.""?? Also, speaking as someone who works in retail, in genearl it's better to simply ask the waitress or employee what's the best way to give a positive review. Sometimes the manager is busy, sometimes the place has an actual system in place for feedback."
4,ak0zkc,t2_z3w2q,Daegog,"YTA, but i do not honestly THINK you intended to be the asshole via showboating. Me and the old lady routinely tell managers when they have exceptional workers, often in vain hopes that maybe the manager will kick them a few extra hours if they ask. Its not much, but we hope it helps."
4,ak0zkc,t2_2r3kpc4p,Vegetable_Owl,NTA. Not the best approach but not an asshole. If both manager and employee were happy that’s what matters. I would say next time fill out the survey so it’s documented.
4,ak0zkc,t2_2opzel9g,PeterParker72,"YTA. Not for the compliment, but for the way you handled it. There was no need to torment the waitress by asking to see the manager and refusing to say what it was regarding. She probably thought you were going to complain."
4,ak0zkc,t2_o4fta,fallonharrod,"YTA for scaring the shit out of the waitress, try to just be a little more mindful of people’s feelings in the future and take this as another lesson learned. Maybe your intentions weren’t bad, and that’s okay, but that just means you need to be extra conscious of how your words and actions may affect others emotionally."
4,ak0zkc,t2_11lli6fn,HotConfusion," Elizabeth and her manifold attractions will remain an enigma, Mr Collins, but your consolations will be many. Your connection to the highly esteemed De Bourgh family will salve the wound greatly, notice from such great persons can hardly fail to please. YTA."
4,ak0zkc,t2_1ibs7mq,Trance2000,"NTA and your date way overreacted if that’s what happened. As a person who’s worked in multiple restaurants over the years, when the clients would tell the manager about any outstanding service I delivered, it would ALWAYS work in my favor in getting praise from the boss/free food/ bonus pay. Really don’t get why your date overreacted."
4,ak0zkc,t2_hab3t,Pm_Me_Gifs_For_Sauce,"NTA, but it wasn't seen that you were an asshole to the waitress, it was supposedly that you were being full of yourself with the group. I think because your heart was in the right place you're NTA. Just in the future, you don't have to be so adamant about it."
4,ak0zkc,t2_dklzgmh,Bearly_Legible,NTA a lot of people on here are answering this with their own opinions but they don't seem to actually be Waiters. People told this all the time to me and it is not assholish. Complimenting a person to their manager that they did a good job is nice no matter how you decide to do it. Don't listen to all these idiots.
4,ak0zkc,t2_3caoj,aldraw,"NTA, your made your date jealous which reveals insecurity in her. Not sure why people here are so up in arms over this."
4,ak0zkc,t2_14xww8j1,Band1c0t,"YTA Wow op as much as I want to support you by saying NTA, but from people perspective, it's really awkward, maybe you have good intention, but the way you deliver it is bad, dunno how old you are, but it seems you lack of common sense or social norm."
4,ak0zkc,t2_1ir2y1at,Dusty1000287,"YTA, you made the poor waitress think that you were going to make a complaint, while that may not have been your intent it came across like that. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_x0cyrn0,stonerplumber,YTA The whole weird may I speak to your manager part makes you an ass. Why give someone the anxiety and draw attention to you and your date by having the manager and the waitress come out and talk to you at your table. 
4,ak0zkc,t2_gbtuw,onikukki,"NTA, I think you did a nice thing that ultimately probably made that waitresses night. You could had more finesse in how you approached it, but no big deal. I think your date (and evidently, Reddit) are being strangely oversensitive. Especially when people here constantly complain about wait staff not getting the recognition they deserve."
4,ak0zkc,t2_u3cqt,Kronos328,"NTA. The people here (and your date) are overreacting. You could at least tell the server that you wanted to compliment her service to her manager so that she could be at ease. It was kinda unnecessary to leave her in the dark about this, but you being an asshole because of this? No. "
4,ak0zkc,t2_3oc6m1z,EclipsedTheSun,"NTA: you did everything right. I work in customer service and would actually like to applaud you for talking up the waitress to her manager. I know how much that probably meant to her. In terms of your date, I'm not sure what her problem is and honestly. If she's overreacting over something so small, you might just want to move on. Just my two cents."
4,ak0zkc,t2_3cu31,stromm,"Nope, NTA. No one should assume asking for the manager is only for negative feedback. Also, your date made the assumption you did that to try to impress her. Well, some people are just nice and understand that positive feedback is important. Sounds like your date is the asshole. Her reaction would have had me break off all contact with her after making sure she got home safely. You don't want that type of personality. "

I think it would be a bad choice for you to go to the in-state school and the out-of-state schools seem like they would be really good for you, I definitely think you should turn down the full ride school based on the info given.

4,adrfbl,t2_6egvdu6,MaxxPwnage,YTA. You’re an adult. You should know better than to scare a child over that when you simply could’ve kept the ball and talked to his parents about reimbursing you for the window.

4,adrfbl,t2_o8uux,Korjos,"YTA. Yes, very much yes. You destroyed somebody elses property! Even more so, a child's Christmas present. I can 100% see the frustration and they are also in the wrong for not kicking the ball elsewhere after you asked, but not as wrong as it was to cut the ball up."
4,adrfbl,t2_rz5fj66,Kecir,YTA. Not only did you destroy a child’s property over an accident but you threatened him with a knife. Huge asshole. Speaking to the parents or calling the cops would have been far more appropriate. What if the kids parents had called the cops and said you pulled a knife on them and cut the ball with it in front of them? You could have ended up in jail cause your behavior was enough to arrest you if they felt the need. 
4,adrfbl,t2_k9002u8,NeoPoe,"ESH, and you lost any ground to request the kids parents pay for the window due to your intentional destruction of their property as retaliation. You could have turned this into a moment that taught the kid how to be a better person, instead you taught him your an AH. &#x200B; edited from YTA to ESH because the kids were in the wrong too, but as the adult who overreacted and brandished a weapon around kids you're the bigger AH"
4,adrfbl,t2_1i44mudl,Rea1Acid,"NTA. Everyone saying YTA are being so precious about this, they vandalised your property and then tried breaking and entering, anyone would have been pissed and lashed out.

4,adrfbl,t2_bybl2,atrueamateur,"YTA. Even though your anger is justifiable and your action is understandable, that doesn't make what you did morally permissible. The kids were just being stupid and probably didn't think anything like this could have happened. A better solution would be to have told the child that you won't return the ball until they return with their parents, and then have a serious talk about the window and your daughter's leg."
4,adrfbl,t2_11nxa2fm,FlatNarwhal,"YTA. The ADULT thing to do would have been to talk to the child's parents about the damage, including your daughter's cut. Instead, you frightened a bunch of small children who are going to tell their parents about the crazy neighbor with a knife. This is very likely to bite you in the ass. &#x200B;"
4,b358s1,t2_2c9j75zd,JNFThrowawayAcct,"NTA. As someone who has had to go no-contact for less dramatic reasons, you're making the right choice. You don't owe your parents to become their caretakers. It's not something you just have to do by default, especially when they're making so many egregious mistakes on their own. Guilt tripping is a manipulation tactic that creates the WORST mental feedback loops, hence feeling bad for taking care of yourself. I suggest checking out r/JustNoFamily and seeing a therapist if you're able. This is going to feel rough for the first few months. I know because I'm doing it. But it absolutely gets better with time. And I'm sorry for how bad things were for you growing up. No kid deserves parents who pull this shit. "

I agree with your ""family"" judgment, you're not obligated to help a lost cause, but I'm quite an asshole I've been told, so probably go with further support.

If someone called/texted for help, I'd reply ""Sorry, on vacation, can't talk"" and then not respond at all for the rest of my time off. When you get back and they (inevitably) try to blame your for everything, shrug and say ""Sorry you had such trouble."" If your manager tries to blame you or reprimand you, tell them to shove it.

4,aeg8xj,t2_pwzt3,youregaylol,"NTA Not only should you tell him that, but you should also stop contact. That sort of lingering emotional connection where you feel for someone but its not truly ""real"" is very unhealthy. Your life is on pause, waiting for a relationship to blossom that was never truly planted in the first place."
4,aftnyt,t2_zd2av,actjustlylovemercy,"NTA. You're BF is not only a cheater, but is trying to gaslight you in saying that conversations that you have seen screenshots of never happened. These people have little to gain by telling you the truth about this asshole, but they still are. Listen to them."
4,adw4pn,t2_ozt81,Dazeydevyne,"YTA because it's not your account, and there is no affect on you from her being on the plan. If she doesn't pay, you aren't hurt. When a bill comes, you don't receive it, so you don't have to see her name. There is literally no connection between the two of you with this, except that you use the same phone carrier and get the same discount. And the one in your head. "
4,adw4pn,t2_18a48bu0,kwneumann,"NTA. But, what would be the point of this before the natural end date of the contract? Doesn't she get a separate bill? It's way more hassle to do it the way you're suggesting. That's why they make you sign a contract. Edit: Obviously if it's open-ended 6 months is plenty of time"
4,adw4pn,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,"YTA because it doesn't really affect you to have her on the plan until the contract ends. So long as she pays your cousin, it's not a big deal for the contact to be finished out. If you want to pay the extra money so everyone else keeps their rates, that's a different story, but you're being irrational and petty."
4,artrda,t2_nvmmo,Eilayth,"YTA, but only because your food is likely to have a very strong scent, which might trigger some people's nausea (which some are already prone to due to forms of motion sickness) Plus, you usually can't exactly air a bus well... Maybe have a bite outside, if you have a rest stop dueing the 5h? "
4,b10y9w,t2_we5yh,darthmask,NTA definitely. Would be a nice brother thing to do if you offered to lend some of the games to him but not necessary and not doing so doesn't necessarily make you an asshole.
4,b10y9w,t2_zyplr,Kranglz,"I’d definitely say NAH instead of NTA. They’re your games. You absolutely have the right to take them with you, and you don’t need anybody else’s consent to do it. On the other side, your brother is 12. You take away games from a 12 year old, they’re going to get upset. Doesn’t make him an asshole either. "
4,aojy7r,t2_qaaph,TooLateHindsight,NTA But do remember when you meet this person online IRL that it be somewhere super public. Lot of creeps online so it's possible he's a nice guy in your age group or a 30yr old man looking for someone to groom.
4,b8z7fh,t2_1x2q50ve,JuicyPluot,"NTA. That’s incredibly imposing of them- to bring all those dogs (some of which aren’t even theirs) to your (smallish) home. It’s your home, your rules. I wouldn’t be okay with it if it were me - I think you’re totally within your right to cancel. "
4,b8z7fh,t2_10xh1q,DClawdude,"NTA. Why can't they host you? Even if I had dogs I probably would not want people bringing 2 more over regularly, let alone 4 more over. >and they have made it obvious that they think I'm being unreasonable. It's your fucking house, they have no room to complain"
4,am4zbz,t2_32o4hedc,ytayta,I'm gonna say YTA Here's why. Other people make decisions about what line they use based on who is already in line and how much shit they have. You standing there without a cart directly influences their decisions. Have some patience. Wait in line like everyone else.
4,am4zbz,t2_udmac,Hunterofshadows,YTA It goes against common practice that forms the social contract we are all expected to adhere to. Imagine if everyone did that. It would be a free for all 
4,am4zbz,t2_17u10d6r,Ontvx,"NTA, but I would get irritated if I saw you standing there and then a cart full of groceries just appears. I get it, but I’m sure people behind you don’t appreciate it."
4,b09tax,t2_2mh8nacs,magikarpjones,"Besides you needing to throw your own trash away, realize that those kcups can grow mold. If you choose not to clean up after yourself, and coincidentally no one else uses the machine, it’ll be ruined for everyone. Nice. "
4,b4ihws,t2_xx4i8,chlocodile,"NTA. Also two tips: 1. Put the pizza on the top rack and the baking sheet below it so the cheese drips down to the sheet, not the oven. 2. Break up with your massive child of a boyfriend"
4,b4ihws,t2_j5hgw,Heidiwearsglasses,"NTA ovens can be cleaned- if it’s a new model it probably even has a self cleaning feature where you press a button and then when it’s done you easily wipe the ashes up. Seems like he’s overreacting and you should probably figure out why. Red flags are flying, don’t ignore them. "
4,b4ihws,t2_2uyazqs,PcsArePeopleToo,"NTA. I am pretty against putting anything directly on the rack but that does not justify the reaction, especially when you are cleaning it. Although it probably would have been better to give him the choice of soggy vs cooked on the rack after the previous fight. But seriously you are NTA and you are right to be worried about his reaction."
4,b4ihws,t2_z5ct2pt,Billi_Pilgrim,"NTA- he does not have the right to be mad because you cooked dinner, you tried to do it to his specifications, and you offered to clean up the mess (and did!). You're right that the yelling comment is disturbing. He basically threatened you. He's definitely the asshole, and you don't deserve to be treated like that."
4,9vc1ts,t2_j2tpxeo,janneyjj,"NTA. You said it yourself ""I feel like as an adult, he should have reached out to me or someone else way earlier. He had \*weeks\* to make his preparations and he waited to the very last minute to mention anything so now it's my fault."""
4,9vc1ts,t2_5g8o2,Tandran,"NTA, I think you should have mentioned something to him about recording with the other person and he should find another partner but as other have said he’s not your responsibility, hopefully this teaches him a lesson. "
4,9vc1ts,t2_x6cdp1k,SquirrelGirlVA,NTA. You tried to get together and he bailed. You're not his mum and he's a big boy. If he can't do the bare minimum for an assignment it's his fault.
4,a3vjz3,t2_2mgd1nae,KrabKush,"NTA but the kid knows what he can get away with around you. As far as ""giving him back"", that's a little ignorant seeing as how you made a commitment to another human being out of your desire to do so. Not trying to be mean, just honest."
4,a3vjz3,t2_lab2czk,datboi4111,"NTA. tbh he sounds like a sociopath, its not bad if you can't handle that and its not worth putting yourself through 20 years of misery, ill probably get roasted for this but its what I think"
4,a3vjz3,t2_178wof,susanz99,NTA. I think you should give him over to the state. Is your husband in agreement? This could destroy your marriage and your life. What happens when he is a teenager and hurts/kills you or others? I think you should relinquish him over to the state.
4,a3vjz3,t2_6q16o,MsTerious1,"NTA. You have a duty to provide a safe environment for your family. When it's one of your family that makes it unsafe, it's healthy to remove that person, even though some will frown upon it. It's a lot easier for people to judge it when they haven't experienced it, because people who have lived with experiences like yours KNOW that there is no such thing as a good outcome sometimes. Sad for you, but I think you deserve loving support, not harsh judgment. "
4,a3vjz3,t2_yvov,reticulatedspline,"NTA. Having feelings doesn't make you an asshole. If you act on them then it might change based on the circumstances, but you haven't yet. Sounds like a terrible situation all around and I feel for you."
4,a3vjz3,t2_2t54drt,Threethumber,I understand how raising a child with special needs can be but if you give up on this kid the YTA. If you follow this course of action then I would ask that you not adopt or try having kids in any other way. Just know that if you give up now that your just going to be the first of many and that will only make this child life worse.
4,a3vjz3,t2_7rpld,Irish_Samurai,"You adopted a child. I’m not sure if you still have a warranty, but it’s a commitment. If you are unfit to handle the situation then let someone else who can do it do the better job. YTA for agreeing to an obligation, to another human being, that you can’t handle. YTA for not being prepared for a possible difficult time, underestimating a child, and not helping him by improving yourself. YTA for taking the easy way out at the expense of a 6 year old. "
4,a3vjz3,t2_16cw3m,Jon-Cent,"NTA because the pain of taking care of a child that has RAD is tough. That is, if the question was ""AITA because I think raising my adopted son is very challenging"" YTA because you want to put him up for adoption. Like previously stated, if that was your biological child, would you still want to put him up for adoption. You committed to taking care of your son the second you adopted him. But still, you have to find therapists officially trained in dealing with RAD."
4,a3vjz3,t2_2if56rqv,Ros1319,"YTA, kinda. Adopting a kid isn’t like adopting a pet. You made a commitment to be a parent, putting him back up for adoption because he has attachment issues is pretty shitty. There are so many other options. More intensive individual therapy, family therapy, and respite care should all be utilized simultaneously, not just individual therapy. You guys should get a family case worker to help navigate treatment plans and treatment needs to be for the whole family. Kids aren’t a commodity. IMO when you choose to become a parent, that’s for life, regardless of how you became a parent. Putting him back up for adoption will only make the attachment disorder worse."
4,a3vjz3,t2_t7k7z,MaotheMao21,"NTA &#x200B; You didn't sign up for this, and all three of you need to manage and have the best outcome. If staying with you is the best, then so be it. But if placing him somewhere else is better for him (and you and your hubbs) then that's the best option."
4,a3vjz3,t2_11rdbden,pepicant,"NTA, but changing your parenting styles so quickly to see what'll work (you mentioned several different things you tried, so changing every few months) is not good for structure for a child. Not knowing how your parents will respond to something can elevate stress. "
4,ajj9su,t2_12erm1,Perepip,"YTA. It's your ticket, not his. Free or not, why should he have to be responsible for something that you decided not to deal with? It's not his fault you chose not to pay the ticket. If someone did that to you I doubt you'd want to pay their ticket."
4,allagl,t2_10y034,centrafrugal,"YTA, kind of. You sound exhausting to be around. It sounds like you can't stand even the mildest of banter. At least you're aware of that and are hopefully doing something about your hyper-sensitivity. "
4,ba8jpv,t2_mpm8sqh,Juggletrain,"ESH With a strong leaning towards YTA. As other commenters have mentioned, you are needlessly sexualizing the situation. Hell, because you are totally aware and revel in the connotations, I would even say you are sexually harassing him."
4,ashi8g,t2_nx0ze,JPLangley,"YTA. You were being pretentious and an attention seeker, but at the same time. Also, don't twist the title to fit your narrative. They walked out on you. Understand that you trying to bruteforce attention out of people is disrespectful. Take this as a learning moment and move on."
4,a0j1is,t2_2m1opqe7,Jon_Joestar,"NTA: suits are expensive and people keep saying to buy a cheap one, but those things fall apart so quick there's no point in spending the money unless you can get at least some quality. But if it's really going to be that big of an issue maybe see if you can rent one?"
4,axt156,t2_5uyon,greenbastardette,"NTA for wanting an equitable contribution from your partner, but don’t ask her to be a homemaker. This isn’t 1955. Tell her you’d appreciate if she started contributing more, and if it’s not going to happen with an income, then you’d appreciate if she’d clean the house or make some meals. "
4,axt156,t2_1ajej3vt,AmJusAskin,"NTA. You live together and I assume you are covering the majority of costs, being the only one earning. It is perfectly reasonable to have a set up where there person not earning contributes in other ways. However, this is something you should discuss and not just expect. Talk to her about it, she may see your point and you can come to an agreement."
4,axt156,t2_39hujf3x,canardyyy,"NTA. Since she’s staying st home she should be doing a little cleaning and cooking. But you should also be helping out. Don’t just assume that if she becomes the homemaker you’ll be spared of all cleaning and cooking, cause that would make you the asshole. Two people living under the same roof means the duties should be divided accordingly. "
4,a52hhj,t2_11exz4,TheRagingScientist,"NTA. He wasn’t just ignoring you, but seems like he was actively going against what you said. And it’s not like you were being unreasonable. I’d be freaking out in that situation too. He should’ve been helping, or at the very least, following your instructions so he didn’t make it harder for you, trying to clean."
4,a52hhj,t2_23lg4kgq,ButtStuffJR,"NTA I do firmly believe that you should get your shit under control. Get medicated, see a therapist, whatever. With that being said, his behavior showed just how much he respects you. You just cleaned those floors and he fucked them all up. I'd have shat on the floor and left. "
4,a52hhj,t2_2qa0p4g7,onechristmasprobl,"NTA I understand your frustration, but you know you're the one with the mental illness right? It's not up to him to work around your unreasonableness. You have to work on yourself. You're being unreasonable. "
4,ah0a9o,t2_3ercp,FlareHeart,"YTA - A year is a completely normal time frame and encountering lube in THEIR bedroom is not being ""shoved in your face."" It's not like it was sitting out on the kitchen counter or something. Yes, it's hard for you, and it sounds like you need to talk to your dad about it since it is making you uncomfortable, but just try to keep in mind that this is normal and although you are uncomfortable, it is not your place to make demands on his relationships."
4,ah0a9o,t2_26mbz04n,csway324,"YTA. I dated a man with a teenage daughter who was completely nasty to me for no apparent reason. I tried with her and it ultimately didn't work out because of her. Children need to stay out of adult relationships and you need to stay out of your father's room. That is his space, not yours."
4,ah0a9o,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,"YTA. No one is shoving anything in your face by doing something in the privacy of their own bedroom that you chose to enter. Your dad can be in another relationship. His relationship with your mother ended when the papers were filed if not earlier, not when the divorce was approved by a judge. People don't become nonsexual beings after they have children or after they get divorced."
4,ag4os8,t2_12tjk69h,patm28,"NTA I’d they’re thinking it is ok for having you sleep on the couch. That being said, you’d probably be responsible for a bit more of the lodging, ie if they have a 7 bedroom, the others couples would split the cost of the room, while you would be responsible for your room. No different than if you all got your own hotel rooms. The other costs should be split equally. That’s just my opinion, "
4,ag4os8,t2_279oil6j,Ash_90528,"NTA- at the beginning I was thinking you might be the asshole, but after the you can just sleep on the couch thing, I've come to the conclusion that the others are assholes. I understand that price can be an issue, but everyone should be treated equally, and fairly. Nobody should be forced to get worse than the others when you all pay the same amount. You should get to enjoy your time just as much as the others."
4,ag4os8,t2_1lvc81je,P_Flange,"NTA. You're paying more than your share AND you're the one that misses out on a bed? I don't think so, and if your friends think that's a fair deal then I have to question how they view the friendship, to be honest. The holiday sounds badly planned if I'm being brutally honest. Each person should be paying the same amount, and the location should be able to accommodate the needs of each person attending. As this is not happening in either sense, the location chosen is unsuitable for purpose. You guys are trying to smash a square peg into a round hole and wondering why it isn't working."
4,ag4os8,t2_19bwl3eq,CrescentDarling,NTA but you need to deal with this issue reasonably. If you're not getting a bedroom too then you should be paying less. From what you said there are other paying less money than you. They should be the ones getting the sofa. Its a mistake of you to offer to pay more when you already know your getting less. Tell them that payment should be equal to what your getting and if they object then don't go.
4,ag4os8,t2_wbc3n,Luvagoo,"NTA but I think the more likely compromise is that you pay the cost of not having a room. Everyone pays $150, you $100 type thing. Because the problem here is that you are already, very kindly, overcompensating for those with financial problems, but that's not your problem, especially if you are paying more AND not getting a room, which really isn't fair. Only one of those is acceptable IMO. "
4,ag4os8,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,NTA. You're paying extra for others? No. You deserve a bed on vacation. They want to throw a fit that they need to pay a little more or you have to sleep on a couch? Selfish. This isn't even a question.
4,b9qtbv,t2_3jbmdt59,FBI_squad,NTA He deserves what he's getting BUT I'd still help him if I were you. Not financially but emotionally. It would firstly be a huge middle finger to his wife and prove that you were right. Secondly it could repair a once great relationship. I think you should try and be the bigger man here and finally come out on top.
4,b9qtbv,t2_36juq6fp,ipdipdu,"NTA he’s made his bed on more than one occasion, he can lay in it. That been said, think about if your happy for this to be the final nail the coffin."
4,b9qtbv,t2_e2mfy,firenoodles,INFO: did he apologize for not helping you during your divorce? He apologized for not believing you BUT did he apologize for telling you to get fucked and cutting off contact for 2 years? I am leaning towards NTA. But there's the potential for ESH if he did apologize and you're continuing to hold a grudge against him.
4,b9qtbv,t2_7cs4l,t3hd0n,NTA &#x200B; you don't do anything you feel uncomfortable about. is he just asking for a handout or is he trying to repair the relationship? if it was just a handout i'd tell him to get dicked.
4,b9qtbv,t2_1hhx77to,Bluemonogi,"NTA I think if I were in your position though I would accept the apology, express that you are sorry his spouse was not good and glad he is getting out of a bad relationship finally. I would kind of leave it there. Maybe recommend a therapist but not offer to get involved in any way."
4,b9qtbv,t2_qswys,Dracon_Pyrothayan,"NTA, but the wiser course is to help him anyway. After all, he's just now getting rid of the bitch that poisoned him against you in the first place - this is a good opportunity to help him scrub the scales from his eyes."
4,b9qtbv,t2_1pivs7pl,RudyRoo2017,NTA but you have an opportunity to be the bigger person and potentially repair your relationship with your brother. Basically your actions will determine your relationship moving forward. It’s totally up to you on what you want to happen
4,b9qtbv,t2_2fvglpdy,_phish_,NTA- you don’t owe him anything but you probably should be the bigger person and try an rebuild the relationship. This is a great opportunity to regain a previous friendship. 
4,b9qtbv,t2_gi6jj,Compactsun,"YTA in a straight black and white world. It absolutely sucks that your brother has been unsupportive of you, you have a potential opportunity to break that cycle here though it's completely understandable if you wouldn't. In your shoes I probably also wouldn't but I would recognise the fact that by doing that I'd be the asshole. "
4,b9qtbv,t2_dulrx,ARX7,"Nta, just remember you repeat his words neck to him if he asks. Also who doesn't check up after the allegation of cheating because it sounds like it didn't stop"
4,b9qtbv,t2_1avluyur,quasimoomoo,"NTA I don't talk to my dad for months/years when he succumbs to his asshole nature so I'm probably not the best one to give advice about dealing with family in this regard. You're definitely not out of line though, just do what you think will make you the most fulfilled long-term."
4,b9qtbv,t2_ts9ya,TheRiddler1976,"YTA (sort of) Be the bigger man. Who knows maybe this could be the start of you having a relationship again, particularly as it sounds like his wife caused all the problems in the first place"
4,axel0q,t2_2u3wuf9y,tairo-,NTA - It’d be different if you got on him for not washing his hands but having urine all over? Ew. He needs to learn to use a p u b l i c restroom.
4,ba6ule,t2_mkpvd9g,QueenMoogle,"Oof. ESH. But in reality if she cannot handle there being 4 women at your office, that is a pretty big red flag honestly. Seems like the level of trust in this relationship is pretty dang low. And I have to say, lying will only make it worse. Edit: you broke up, sorry. I’m glad about that. But I maintain my answer."
4,b3s2dk,t2_11jkva,scotty_doesntknow,"YTA just because of: “They do not have any ties to white supremacy nor did they hold any racist views.” Just because someone isn’t out actively burning crosses doesn’t mean they have no racist views. In fact it’s pretty difficult to say that about any living human, because people aren’t great at evaluating their own biases. President “Individual 1” thinks he doesn’t have a racist bone in his body even after re-tweeting white supremacists and islamaphobes. And also don’t mind saying YTA bc this is clearly a fake post."
4,b3s2dk,t2_gpa1e,gerbil_111,"YTA. YTA. YTA. This flag was the one waved in the fight to keep black people slaves. This is the flag that was waved by the KKK as they burned churches and lynched people. That the flag is a symbol of racism is not in question. The question is if you should be ashamed to display it. Yes, you should. You know what people do with heirlooms? They have them in boxes in their closet. Not hung over their desk as a statement of ""This is me. This is what I am proud of"". &#x200B; Your attempt to further damage this person of color is only going to make you more of an asshole, since it is going to put you on Fox news as a white supremacist."

She went into a private area and took something with family value and ministry value and she broke it. That's just not something you do. She also injured your wife. Even without the sentimental value, she broke something of yours causing direct damages maliciously. I'd take legal action "
4,b3s2dk,t2_13l4ik,Deadly9750,NTA. This woman came into your home in your private office and destroyed something with a lot of sentimental family history to it. You should absolutely press charges to the fullest extent the law allows. She clearly cannot respect boundaries and you are in no way wrong in this situation. If you cannot accept the consequences to your actions then she shouldn't have destroyed your property. 
4,b3s2dk,t2_37lfxgcq,Kitrak101,"NTA NTA NTA This lady was way out of line, the fact that she took the frame and smashed it makes her TA. Imagine if that glass cut your wife's stomach or hit someone in eye? She definitely shouldn't be working in a hospital. Also this flag is in YOUR house in YOUR room. She has no right to act the way she did. That ""young woman"" isn't a child, she is a grown women who had a temper tantrum, even after hearing the history behind your family's flag."
4,b3s2dk,t2_pijkjv6,djternan,NTA You're not flying it from the back of some shitty lifted truck. You had it in your private office where she had no business being. It's a historical piece and has some sentimental value since your family members carried it into war. She deserved to be arrested and good luck getting all you can in the civil suit.
4,b3s2dk,t2_153h8o,craigus17,"NTA. It’s a bit tricky, I mean yes it’s a family heirloom but WHY is it a family heirloom? Seems a bit dangerously close to you keeping a memento to the fact that your ancestors were racists. You may not be racist yourself but by keeping it you are arguably indirectly supporting your ancestors’ views. Although I suppose the counter argument is that acknowledging is not the same as celebrating. It’s a tricky subject, BUT it’s one that shouldn’t have come up since it was in your private room, which is what made me settle on NTA."
4,b3s2dk,t2_12ds7s,ThriftyLizzie27,"NTA- She went into your orivate office, damaged your personal items and hurt your wife. All not ok at all. As far as charges make sure they stick. She fucked up her own career by her behavior."

4,b6ck7u,t2_9qnmm,Lawlzstomp,NTA I agree with your assessment that him lying and her apparently being shitty are good reasons for you to be upset with the situation. I would hope if you phrased it the way you phrased it your post that your SO actually hears you and is willing to make a change. 
4,b37qkk,t2_13l4ik,Deadly9750,"NTA. Scary movies are for lack of a better word, scary. I try to avoid then at all cost. If they legitimately bother you than your GF should understand and not bother you about it. I only believe she is the AH in this situation because she is still mad at you instead of moving past this. "
4,b37qkk,t2_98j9m,Consirius,"NTA Scary movies are a difficult genre that are less about ""like/dislike"" because they're actually intended to give a feeling of fear to the audience. It's more of an experience than just a movie. If you have an issue with it, you are in your right to sit this one out. It's not a matter of disliking a genre; it's the dread of being scared, and it's in your right to avoid that."
4,avjyev,t2_yua7p,pearl_pluto,"NTA. But only because you moved your bag, sure there were other empty seats and other people with bags on seats, But seats are for people, not bags and if someone wants to sit where you've put your bag for whatever reason, they have priority over your luggage."

4,avjyev,t2_k9r6x,RhoBautRawk,"NTA, if there were many other empty seats available you should have just ignored her. If this happens to you again where someone asks you a favor but in a really bitchy way tell them, ""Why do you expect me to do you a favor with such a sour attitude?"""
4,aejroo,t2_16lyhpn,Mr_PetitJean,"YTA, not because of the why but because of the how. Circumstances beyond her control are taking away an opportunity she was looking forward to. Don't be an arse, commiserate, be considerate. "

Your travelling to a hugely populated area I doubt your girlfriend is going to be the cause of illness. "
4,aejroo,t2_k1le5,Rambo1stBlood,"NTA, and it's not even your fault. Tell your GF she has bad luck to get sick like that so close to the trip - but ultimately you shouldn't be taking responsibility for her not being able to go unless you are the disease making her sick."
4,aru0cj,t2_qyne07w,Hoophoop31,NTA. Your dad isn’t borderline abusive. He is straight up abusive. His sexual comments and unwanted contact is truly sick and in no way a normal interaction between father and daughter. You deserve so much better from your parents and I’m so sorry you didn’t get it. 
4,a4qh0w,t2_c1ktm,LevyWife,NTA in the least bit; maybe this will encourage her to work harder to keep her dog contained. She's really lucky it hasn't been stolen considering how much she's just leaving everything up to chance.
4,a4qh0w,t2_6zb4t,adenovellis,"NTA. If she knows the dog gets out all the time, it should have a damn collar with tags. She's an idiot owner. You did the best you could in your situation. I commend you for getting the slip leash and getting the dog off the streets.youre good peoples"
4,a4qh0w,t2_88j6b1n,MatterCaster,"NTA. She is because she is an irresponsible dog owner who is rude and ungrateful on top of that. You did nothing wrong. In fact, you went out of your way to save her pet. If you see the dog again, do the same thing, but next time don't leave any way for her to contact you. Just give the contact information for animal control."
4,aus9cf,t2_wntqt,laurpr2,"YTA. Ideally, it would be equally convenient/inconvenient for everyone; so, if two of the other people live by you, and he's the only one who lives 20 miles away, 1/4 of your meetings should take place in his neck of the woods. "
4,apxa03,t2_2kx5gegv,Ihatecoughsyrup,"YTA. I am sorry, I agree that honesty is usually the best policy but there are different ways to say things. You told her in front of a group of people that she smelled of cat piss. You should have done it in a different way and above all you should have talked to her privately. I am not surprised that she cried. The whole experience for her was for sure very humiliating. "
4,apxa03,t2_phiaq,PsycoticANUBIS,"NTA. I am not afraid to let people know when they smell. If they know they smell but don't care, they are just rude. If they don't know they smell but find out they do, they can work on the problem. Personally if I smell I want someone to tell me so I don't make the people around me uncomfortable or even possibly sick."
4,apxa03,t2_2sa3f7yt,mgood1938,"NTA. Maybe I would've told her this in a 1 on 1 conversation instead of around others, but regardless, I think it needed to be said. Hopefully your comment helped her realize she needed to do something. It's a sensitive topic for anyone, but especially teenage girls."
4,ajbuox,t2_7g6ezjl,FIVE_DARRA_NO_HARRA,"NTA, but your formatting is all fucked the fuck up. Also, why are you 18+ and still so worried about ""suspicious"" grandparents. What do they have to be suspicious of? ALSO, keep in mind that, while you did have a plan to meet, the plan was to meet at his job. Yes, it's absolutely plausible that something came up at his job where he was working at his job."
4,axfrqy,t2_fsq9u,No_regrats,YTA and also obviously trolling/shitposting. He booked his seat well in advance and paid extra for it. It's clear that you felt entitled to his seat but you actually aren't. You asked for a favor. He politely declined. You should have left it at that. He likely did not find joy in seeing you suffering since he was pretending to be asleep according to you. You are not the center of the universe that you imagine you are. Edit: LMAO at OP's having a temper tantrum and leaving. Now I am thinking she wasn't trolling and that she truly did feel this entitled. Definitively the asshole.
4,axfrqy,t2_ie8e4,Axelean,"YTA for being an entitled asshole. He paid the same fare as you, why should he give up the things he PAID for. He is not obligated to help you in any way. You asked, he declined, that should be the end of discussion for any DECENT human being yet you kept pestering him"
4,axfrqy,t2_2fg8lk0l,HydeNSikh,"YTA. He booked the seat he wanted, you chose your seat. For you to have any expectations of him switching based solely on your desire for more comfort, and being shocked that he didn't jump at the opportunity, smacks of entitlement. Also, I suspect that you overstated his reaction."
4,an6sao,t2_bu85a3o,Louwye,NTA...It is common for people who don't yet have a full grasp on their sexuality to do things either out of social norms or experimentation. It does not define their identification just based on history.
4,an6sao,t2_1405k6,baepsaemv,NTA. Who is she to tell you how to identify? You have a really common lesbian experience and it’s beyond insulting for anyone to tell a lesbian that they need to accept being ‘sexually fluid’ just because they have a past with men.
4,av62iw,t2_7a0tat9,saraloverock,"NTA if she’s causing that much stress in the home then the relationship is toxic to the kids, especially the 12 year old. Your Dad needs to decide if the relationship is more important to him than his daughters. "
4,av62iw,t2_32mha63q,CaptainMericaOG,"NTA. However, it’s your dad’s relationship and there’s not a whole lot you can do about it. People need to come to these conclusions on their own. "
4,b1i2m8,t2_37kjnhzn,ElaiosAdonaios,"NTA She's been inconsiderate for a long time, and you finally said it in a way she would listen to. Don't tolerate someone disregarding you that way. Her feeling bad that she has negatively impacted her experience is the appropriate reaction from her."
4,av26n3,t2_2fhsdhl9,ImBadAtReddit69,"NAH. They fucked up by accidentally letting the food get contaminated, which happens from time to time. But if they didn't want to offer a full free lunch, they shouldn't have offered. "
4,aczngx,t2_756llp1,OnemoreSavBlanc,"NTA I’m sorry to say but he’s making it very clear where his priorities lie and it’s not with you. And in my opinion, as a parent my kids would always come first."
4,ay4n6k,t2_1xmuoznt,junkfoodmama,NTA that was a pretty awful thing for her to do and I think your response was perfect for the situation. It sounds like she needs to be trying harder to try to form a relationship with you. 
4,a0b6t8,t2_ccbui,SnausageFest,"Yta. Same sentiment as the people saying NAH, but the reason I think you're an asshole is you expect him to be able to modify his behavior while giving yourself a pass on yours. You think it's fine to never learn to flip a fucking switch consistently but not okay for your step dad to never learn to not be vocally annoyed by it. That's ridiculous."
4,a22rc3,t2_15xjp2,Annie_Benlen,"YTA. If there is a limited amount of overtime why are do you feel entitled to it over your coworkers? You feel unwelcome if you don't get preferential treatment? He's trying to make things more fair. What exactly would you be arguing for in a confrontation? ""I know I'm getting more overtime and feel guilty about it, but hey, I should get it or else I won't feel welcome and to hell with fairness!"" "
4,a22rc3,t2_ljn7376,noot4,"YTA and you're being a drama queen. As for your question, you should do neither. You need to accept that overtime should be shared between colleagues and if anything he should get more because he has seniority. You're essentially asking if you should pitch a fit for not getting to benefit from favouritism. Grow up my guy."
4,b3l3ah,t2_3edch5rb,starwarprincess,"NTA- if he isnt meeting your needs, and it seems like it, then you are fine. As long as you get another one that works better, it's okay. They are used to losing clients for many reasons. Some can be as small as therapy type. It's all about the needs of the client as long as its healthy. "
4,aephhd,t2_12jlkk,Dingusatemybabby,NTA. Sounds convoluted and miscommunication happened all over the place but you have the right to be upset. Not sure how long you have been talking to her but the fact you have a kid should naturally come up in conversation pretty early.
4,af3p0d,t2_2ucgt8ro,borntobiyoung,"YTA ..... I mean, they dont owe you an invite, the only way to move on is to live your own life. If your family is only a negative thing at this point, it's best to just move one. If you're happy, than what do they matter?"
4,abfn7c,t2_ki8yn,UnpoppedColonel,"NTA but a specific alternative plan at home—cooking a meal together, watching Netflix, etc.—might have helped mentally get him there so he didn’t throw a fit like a big baby."
4,ab4hn4,t2_zjtdy,gen_angry,"NTA - not your circus, not your monkeys. You had plans and are not obligated to watch her children, and poor planning on her part doesn't constitute an emergency on yours. I just wouldn't expect to ask anything of her for a long while, if ever. Enjoy your day. :)"
4,agr10n,t2_17v15f6,min6char,"NAH. You're making categorically the right move, BUT, it sounds like it's going to be a hard sell for your GF, who sounds like she's got some of that ""family forever"" mentality that you have to outgrow if your family is toxic. Your GF isn't an asshole for not being on the same page yet, but hopefully she'll get on it pretty quick."
4,agr10n,t2_1m0abdfm,LivingAtAltitude,"NTA You need to have serious conversations about this. I would recommend a relationship counselor because it would be easier for this to become volatile. I therapist can guide the conversation when needed. You have every right to protect your children and I commend you for giving it thought ahead of time. You can make sure that the kids aren't left alone with the in-laws without it being a ""thing"". Don't make it a known rule, just don't let the situation arise,"
4,aije30,t2_2xt2xb0r,Strong_Mogambo,"NTA. Your business associate of all people should understand that if the agreed on terms of an agreement are not honoured, then the agreement is null. The daughter was not obliged to take the job, or coerced (AFAIK). She chose to do it of her own free will and then failed to do it properly. In what world should she get the rewards for doing it? You wouldn't pay a builder that failed to build the thing he was hired to build. This is no different."
4,aije30,t2_ydtoi,Haas19,"NTA I work with industrial chemicals. You need to use the enzyme/bacteria based cleaner every day (don’t mop it up, let it soak in. Best to spray some on at night and let it sit all night) It will take a week-10 days but if the enzymes and bacteria work properly it will resolve your problem. Urine is extremely difficult to resolve but a proper product will work if used correctly."
4,aije30,t2_z0tkn,SimAlienAntFarm,NTA: Fucking yikes. I have four cats and I manage to keep on top of that shit without driving them to a piss based revolution. Your sitter has no excuse.
4,aije30,t2_ojmdn,missinglynx61,"I suspect in every jurisdiction, you will be required to pay her for the work performed. As you also warned her of what would happen if the litter box was not cleaned, you can also sue her for the damage caused by her failure to clean it. You also have home insurance that may pay for damages. She would just be responsible for the deductible. So, yes, YTA for not paying as agreed."
4,aije30,t2_skkj5th,teethnail,"NTA at all. I can’t trust anybody to watch my pets that aren’t my dear friends that love him also, and this is why. If I didn’t have them, only a professional pet sitter would do. The nerve of that sitter and her mother. If possible, have them pay in part for the damages. If your cat doesn’t do that with you and her “care” is the only variable, then she wasn’t doing her job and logically shouldn’t be paid. "
4,aije30,t2_2uhp4fz5,ShoddyVariety,"NTA Absolutely not , she refused to do one of the most important jobs , not to mention she only had 3 jobs. She straight up ignored your instructions."
4,aije30,t2_2tkfzve7,fatnisseverbean,NTA. Use that $1000 to recoup the loss of wages from work for the time you have to clean and/or for a professional to come in and clean. 
4,aije30,t2_6c2emo2,cubs_070816,"NTA, and the mother can fuck right off. her daughter is 23. mom's opinion on the matter is wholly irrelevant. make daughter take you to court if necessary. she won't. "
4,aije30,t2_h6uaizj,otterlyawwsome,"NTA, i understand why people are saying yta but this was agreed by both parties. I do think its a failure to not document the damage and then the cost to repair/fix the damage. The cat was fed and healthy on return so I would had a discussion on reduction of payment to cover damaged property. Withholding the full amount might be a little extreme. "
4,aije30,t2_2w077kcd,burner10133,"NTA This is why you don’t mix business with personal. If you don’t pay, she may no longer do business with you. It’s not the cats fault. "
4,aije30,t2_2wcg1ez1,team_sita,"Nta: she's lucky you're not trying to find a way to get the costs of your damages off her. Imo if they keep pushing you, is exactly what I would try to do. She didn't uphold her end of the agreement. Now her and the co-worker can learn a lesson in accountability."
4,aije30,t2_6jux4,jimmahdean,"NTA morally for sure, but I would definitely check about legally. An employee who fails at their job is still legally required to be paid for the time spent working. Even if they do literally nothing during their shift, if they're punched in they have to be paid per the department of labor."
4,aije30,t2_t8jwd0r,FargoHat,"YTA. Why would she feed the cat and get the mail, etc., but not clean out the litter box. Has it occurred to you that during your 7.5 week absence, that your cat started acting out because s/he missed you? Cats do that all the time. Pay the girl what you owe her her, and reconsider pet ownership if you are just going to leave them for months at a time. "
4,aije30,t2_t2tyry6,jippyzippylippy,"NTA, but you did pay the woman less than a dollar an hour for her time. Even if you included food with that, it's 3rd world country wages at best. Next time hire a professional."
4,aije30,t2_bdno8,Devilsfan118,"lol NTA In fact, you should be going after her for damages tbh. The mother should consider herself lucky you aren't. If they keep dicking you around, maybe you should threaten that to see if they'll shut up."
4,a2lnof,t2_1cz04anu,Illumnyx,"NTA. As someone with narcassistic parents, I can tell you that nothing feels better than to thrive in spite of the problems they bring. Take this time to work on yourself away from them. Contact them and maybe even talk about it eventually, but only when you're in a comfortable enough headspace to do so."
4,az7l9u,t2_y521l,Callme_Alice,"NTA. You could tell him it was intended as a family outing, but you'd be happy to go with him another time. But in general, him becoming passive-aggressive rather than just telling you that his feelings were hurt is kind of a red flag and makes him TA here. "
4,b5tgo2,t2_yk06i,Robsterclaws,NTA - you work for your money and you shouldn't have to pay for their mistakes. The cashier should have offered to remove the extra item and then charged you for the drink. 
4,b5tgo2,t2_mkta0,Rose_Knight789,NTA you handled the situation correctly by leaving a review. The worker could have resolved the issue themselves or the manager could have while you were there.
4,b5tgo2,t2_2jg9uc7,moose8617,"NTA. Mistakes happen, but you should not be charged for something you didn't order. They should have refunded the difference in cost between the drink you ordered and the wrong item they gave you and should have taken back the item you didn't want (or just let you have it; different places will do different things). &#x200B; The manager contacted you and fixed the error which, to me, almost certainly means that the cashier erred. Don't feel bad."
4,b5tgo2,t2_118qjmsb,BaddestBetch,"NTA, if you work in customer service, the customer comes first ALWAYS. He didn't want to help out and since the ""problem was delt with"" that was probably not his first time being a lazy jerk."
4,b5tgo2,t2_3bm900mg,matapissu,"NTA. The cashier seems that he doesnt give an F about customer service and $5 is a significant amount of money. Also, messing while it's food (and drinks) time is not acceptable"
4,b5tgo2,t2_qjxe176,teriaavibes,NTA I work at McDonald's and when I order there and they mess my order and I am getting a refund every time if you pay for service you are getting the value not something else or less of it 
4,b5tgo2,t2_1blgmhqj,Dandan419,Nta. I work in a restaurant with the public and I would never treat a customer like that. He deserves whatever punishment came to him. 
4,b5tgo2,t2_3s7p1,123draw,NTA. It blows my mind when service employees take stupid fucking stands over issues that should be easily remedied. The cashier chose his hill to die on and frankly you did the owner a favor.
4,b5tgo2,t2_59lcd,Korrin,"NTA. It is basic customer service skills to just refund the incorrectly added item and charge the customer for what they want in this situation, especially when you're courteous about it and you bring up the issue right away. They're the asshole for even arguing about it, because who cares who's fault it is. You could have misspoke, they could have missheard, they could have typed it in wrong, it doesn't fucking matter. Them trying to argue fault or prove you wrong and try to force you to pay for something you don't want is them creating a hostile situation."
4,b5tgo2,t2_t0gra,Rivka333,"NTA. The owner needs to know about these sorts of things so that he can run his restaurant properly. And if, say, the cashier was well-meaning, maybe new and simply confused, the owner would have been aware of that, and would have taken it into account. "

4,b43kef,t2_2fhpp6z1,thebirbs,"NTA She sounds terrible. I wouldn’t choose to be around her if she was my own mother. If you can tolerate her at some point it may be good to be there for her kids, since the poor things have to be with her all the time. "
4,b43kef,t2_2gozbblq,Quinnnngjejdb,NTA it doesn't sound like she ever apologized or showed willingness to change so it's a pretty good idea to stay away from her and look after your mental health 
4,b43kef,t2_f3xns,Halorym,"NTA I don't believe anyone should be judged based on things about themselves they cannot change. Race, sex, age, disability, and even blood. This goes both ways, you don't get a free pass for your immutable characteristics either. You should have every right to disown fucked up family without being judged for it."
4,acx62a,t2_mrvla,PrivilegedPatriarchy,"If she's as well behaved as you say, YTA. Everyone makes mistakes occasionally, her phone could have actually died and she lost track of time, so just telling her to make sure to let you know when she's coming home should suffice. "

4,azybh8,t2_2pg70np3,Exiled_From_Twitter,NTA of course. And while frankly everyone has the right to live how they wish to live they DO NOT have the right to indoctrinate children into their nonsensical world. You did the right thing and you should do what feels right regarding talking your siblings into making the right decisions for themselves. 
4,azybh8,t2_3as1877c,DM-Mormon-Underwear,"NTA, fellow ex-cultist here, doing more at this stage could very well have negative consequences for your siblings. I would suggest doing your best to maintain communication with them, let them know they can trust you to support them no matter what their choices are. When they are older you will likely be able to offer them real help if need be. I am not sure if there are any communities specific to your former cult but you may want to check out /r/Exittors/."

4,arooyg,t2_2tdkyvo4,tequilathehun,YTA They’re practically adults. They have the right to use their own devices in their own home. Why would you implement any rule saying otherwise? Not to mention the vast majority of kids that age use electronics as the sole way of doing schoolwork or staying in touch with friends when they aren’t able to face-to-face socialize
4,arooyg,t2_35b6ghn3,trekmystars,YTA. You are not preparing your kids for the real world. They don't have a way to do homework or contact their kids. It just shows your kids you don't trust them and pretty soon they are going to have to start sneaking around to be able to get anything done. 
4,arooyg,t2_11cn4nfq,garrbl,"YTA. Piling on a bit here, but what you're doing here is at best ensuring they'll resent you for years, and very likely keeping them from being able to learn how to self-control. ""Because I said so,"" which is what your reason amounts to, isn't a good reason for just about anything for a 13 year old, let alone a 16 year old. "
4,arooyg,t2_eqw0p,Thelonius16,"YTA. You won’t know for sure if the phones will hurt their grades until you trust them to use them responsibly. Your job isn’t just to make them do well in school, it’s to give them a chance to practice life skills such as balancing responsibility with leisure. Let them try and then take the phones away if they fuck up. The lesson from that is more important than whatever crap they are learning in high school."
4,arooyg,t2_6hd7lqs,Zeniaaa,"YTA — I understand not wanting your children to be zombies, but your rules are unnecessarily extreme. Why not confiscate phones during homework time and give them back once they are finished? You could also implement rules like “no phones at dinner” or “no phones after 10:00 PM.” I think there is a happy medium here. "
4,arooyg,t2_12othv,AlphaBreak,"YTA. You're worried that **if** they have electronics, their grades will suffer. Do they have a history of that problem? Do you believe that you're raising your children to be responsible for themselves, or are you raising them to be responsible only so long as you remove any potential roadblocks? Your son is 16. In a couple years, he'll be out of the house and taking care of himself. He's going to have electronics during the week eventually; you have to decide whether you want that to be now where you can intervene and help if it becomes an issue, or if you want it to happen for the first time at college where a problem could destroy an entire semester before you can do anything about it. "
4,arooyg,t2_29heo3zo,gayplantdad,YTA. They’re old enough to learn how to manage school and free time. If you keep doing this they won’t be able to handle themselves in university and they’ll really slip. I have around the clock access to my electronics and I had to learn to manage my time and I get straight 90’s so 
4,arooyg,t2_no9g7,PsychicAce,"YTA Wtf kind of controlling behaviour is that? Are they giving any signs that the grades would drop if they had their electronics? BTW, you are punishing them. Electronics are a big part of peoples lives today, and should be respected as such. &#x200B; Must be nice to be able to ask all these people their opinion of your device. That you have right now. That isn't locked away."
4,arooyg,t2_hwwhk,cap826,"YTA you’re socially isolating your kids. Growing up we weren’t allowed to watch tv or play video games during the week, which I think is pretty reasonable. Not allowing your kids to talk to their friends during the week is pretty cruel."
4,arooyg,t2_xp8560v,deadheaddestiny,YTA I could understand for younger kids but once they are in their teens they should be allowed electronics. Your essentially grounding your kids all week for no reason
4,arooyg,t2_1h5samaz,psam99,"YTA I think this is a generation misunderstanding that happens far too often. Teenagers that age need technology as it is an essential part of their life, it's how they communicate and interact with the world. Give them access to their phones/PlayStation and see what happens, if their grades drop then teach them about responsibly using their phones and gaming. If you have to it is okay to limit access but don't do it unnecessarily, you're currently punishing them from doing nothing wrong."
4,arooyg,t2_qtaeemg,JediAreTakingOver,"YTA - You arent letting them develop their own self-control skills or letting them fail at self-control and learning a lesson. Especially at age 16, where that child will be off to post-secondary in a year or two. Youve shown no trust in your children at all and thats the lesson their going to take with them."
4,arooyg,t2_qhki5,SB-1,"NTA. It's right to limit their access to technology due to the well documented mental health issues it causes, but you're going overboard not allowing them any time at all because it puts them at a social disadvantage. If I recall correctly, the healthy limit is something like two hours a day. Definitely they shouldn't be having phones in their rooms overnight though, and obviously employ a filter."
4,arooyg,t2_9mk2w,trytryagainn,"NTA. I would reframe the issue for them that taking away the phones isn't punishment, it's about issues that develop when kids are in front of electronics all of the time. But also, maybe lighten up some, especially the 16 year old. The kids need to learn balance, and they can't if they don't have the opportunity. Maybe something like ""one hour after school"" or ""use if you have homework questions."" Keeping the phones from them during sleeping hours is great idea. "
4,arooyg,t2_4h063,dreadneck,"NTA - There is nothing wrong with not using phones in the house as long as you hold yourself to the same standards. I might not confiscate the phone, but I would and do limit using phones in the house. My kid can watch TV, play video games, or use the computer for non-social media. To me, the phone is a different type of device which changes the nature of the media. This sub tends to track younger, so you are going to get hate for your decision."
4,b14bpm,t2_2v42fju3,klemma13,"NTA it really wasn't that bad and no where near as bad as what she did, but you're gonna get a lot of people saying the opposite because women are very favoured on this sub. So take their judgement with a grain of salt"

4,akpiv6,t2_z8xgm,Lovelyladykaty,"NTA — the nosy part of me would love to see the screenshots, but honestly we don’t need them. Trust your instincts and save you the headache of posting next time. Your mother’s state of mind can no longer be trusted due to the alcoholism wearing away her reason. "
4,9tvesl,t2_ccbui,SnausageFest,"Nta, but your logic here is incomplete. A) theres rarely two choices. Local elections are the best time to look at independent and third party candidates. That's how they get experience to run for larger offices. B) you're not just voting on elected officials. Theres ballot measures that will likely have a bigger impact on your day to day than your representatives."
4,9tvesl,t2_jtaoa,slipstitchy,People die fighting for the right to vote and you can't even be bothered to do some research and decide which candidate you'd prefer in office. YTA
4,b8rl82,t2_175929,redditKMC,"YTA - you are talking about a game over someone's real life suffering. Nothing about the game is important to this person right now - just back off and do the trade when he comes back around, don't be an insensitive jerk. You never put gaming in front of real life pain and suffering, ever!"
4,b6yt93,t2_y50cq,TheExarion,"NTA, and I’m inclined to believe this post isn’t real because of how much you seem to remember from this exchange. Most people don’t remember that much from arguments, but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. If your mother is actually like this, you probably need to consult CPS or something dude. That behavior isn’t okay at all and at the very least borders on being abusive."
4,b1tc1q,t2_ycfq3,unabowler,"NTA. It's a shit test where she asks you a question and blames you for giving an honest answer. Shitty behavior on her part. Separate from that, 40 pounds is a massive amount of weight gain in one year, especially at age 21. "
4,b7ko06,t2_ia3u4iv,DrLilyPaddy,"NTA- Guilt trilping a 12-yo for child support is the. ultimate. dick. move. If, even after that and everything else, you gave her a chance, which you did, you have every right to just cut all ties with her."
4,b7ko06,t2_ub2zo,miladyelle,"NTA. Tell dad and BF that you love them, but that the topic of your mom is off-limits. They’ve made their position clear, but at the end of the day they’re spectators in this—it’s your decision about your life. "
4,a6jc38,t2_13imw9,Brandelyn1135,"NTA. The person who sat next to you and harassed you is *definitely* TA! I am furious on your behalf that she felt entitled to put her hands on your earbuds, hide your notebook, and basically bully you the rest of that ride. She also took a seat from a pregnant woman, who voluntarily gave up her seat. I hope you were able to focus on your test and got a good score. "
4,a6jc38,t2_6egvdu6,MaxxPwnage,"NTA at all. If she was standing to begin with and they were polite about it then you would be, but they decided to act like children that couldn’t get there way. You did the right thing here. "
4,a6jc38,t2_10tayt,LadyGrey90,"NTA, the pregnant woman deserved a seat but her friend had no more right over the seat than you did."
4,a6jc38,t2_6yuaf,Viperbunny,"NTA. I had three very difficult pregnancies. I was grateful if people offered me a seat, but I never expected it. I have health issues and I can't imagine asking for, let alone demand a seat from anyone. The friend who was harassing you was a complete asshole. She could have given up her seat. As soon as she put her hands on your and your stuff, she became a huge asshole. "
4,a6jc38,t2_1rnny1gu,Kghp11,"NTA - while it would have been the super polite thing to do, she gave up her seat. She and her friend have no idea what your own limitations may be. Her friend was WAY out of line and was definitely the asshole. And anybody else giving you mean looks and not offering up their own seats are in the asshole category too. "
4,a6jc38,t2_8gc9d,captcha_trampstamp,"NTA. She already had one seat, which is all she needs. Expecting everyone to give her a footrest is bullshit, and especially reacting like a bullying shit when told no? Fuck no. "
4,a6jc38,t2_1yvhpw72,galeaphyr,"NTA You’re not obliged to give up your seat for anyone (unless you’re sitting in a clearly marked one for pregnant, elderly, etc). It’s a nice gesture. In this particular situation, the friend is the AH. Firstly she took the seat of the pregnant lady, didn’t give it back and instead harassed you to try to take your seat."
4,a6jc38,t2_2ktm3y26,confusedspeckledcow,NTA they dont know your health . I look perfectly healthy. I cant stand more than 30 min at a time without paying for it in massive pain. And on that merit alone you are not the asshole
4,a6jc38,t2_nw84heo,InBreadDough,"NTA It’s a kind thing to give up the seat, not mandatory. Lack of kindness does not entail rudeness, and when they were rude to you, while you clearly needed the seat makes them the asshole."
4,a6jc38,t2_85c9k,sedatemenow,"NTA. There was a seat available, the pregnant woman had it and gave it up. More than likely, they were ""complaining"" about their feet so they could sit next to each other. Pregnant women can connive also."
4,a6jc38,t2_8cboy,dratthecookies,"NTA. I'm actually kind of glad that you didn't give up, because they were clearly trying to run some stupid scam. Her friend could have gotten up, or anyone else on the bus could have given up their seat if they cared that much. "
4,a6jc38,t2_28lapqvl,ManateeFlamingo,"NTA...there was a bus full of people who could have given her a seat, especially the ones giving you a look. "
4,a6jc38,t2_9klq92z,everynameistaken000,"NTA the pregnant woman WAS sitting. She chose to stand. Clearly they were trying to secure both seats but you had no obligation to give your seat to someone who had HAD a seat and chose to give it up, banking on the fact you would then let her sit back down. &#x200B;"
4,a6jc38,t2_12icvp,internetobscure,"NTA. And I was all set to say you were (but understandingly, since you had been waiting for an hour) until I got to the part where the pregnant woman DID have a seat until she decided to give it up for her asshole friend. And then that friend pulled your headphones off an started harassing you? Nope. "
4,a6jc38,t2_kn2pzq,sapheless,NTA Something similar happened to me when I was younger and was lucky enough to receive help from other passengers. The thing the worries me the worst is what type of individual this pregnant lady is gonna raise. 
4,a6jc38,t2_z1b96,Myshkinia,"I was going to say that you’re the asshole without exception for this, as I’ve been pregnant and it REALLY hurt to stand for any period of time at all, and lots of women experience that, but now that I’ve read through it, NTA. "
4,9wj0vy,t2_mxp30k,Michibear8,"NTA. I am not sure if you have to give written notices, sometimes it seems to depend on the place, but even at that point still not the asshole. Notices in general are not required, usually they are more of a customary/nice/friendly thing to do for the business and allows you to have a reference if you decide to put them down for future jobs."
4,ad16oy,t2_2rfthrzg,iuwerih,"You don't owe anyone anything, but it wouldn't hurt to at least be polite, as you are getting a reputation. If you can't be bothered with girls, then why are you on Tinder? NTA but this is verging on shitpost because some details make me feel doubtful."
4,b47k4y,t2_rsoto,eatthebunnytoo,"NTA at all for being a logical human being who sees this growing trainwreck and feels sad/ upset. For your own mental health you should probably quit enabling and back off the friendship though, things are about to get significantly worse. "
4,b47k4y,t2_1nbtmclq,annbeagnach,"YTA for enabling her. She has a degree and could work, but she’s on assistance? You have only her word she’s blaming this on him. She’s a lazy, liar defrauding taxpayers that work. Distance yourself if you’ll be paying their food bills for 4. "
4,alvy2p,t2_dg0wy,ness839,"**NTA** Whew, that first paragraph is heavy duty for a high school relationship. You need to be enjoying high school and prepping for adulthood, not basically being a caretaker to one of your peers."
4,al3pg3,t2_2zgcw007,itsaquagmire,NTA- I reported my aunt for tax evasion. Make sure you fill out the form that rewards you a percentage of what your parents owe. I believe it’s a 20% reward if I remember correctly 
4,b8qalq,t2_cp6h53j,The_B0FH,NTA. I'd quit giving my time and money to ANY place that treated my child like that. You are not asking her to give up her social circle. all you are asking for is to stay away from spaces that are damaging to your mental and emotional well being. Your mom needs to prioritize better and stop being willfully blind to how they treat you. 
4,b8qalq,t2_c45yprh,Pollypocketful,"NTA. Not in the least. You shouldn’t have to be around people, much less do free work, for people who ostracise you. If your mother needs extra help, she should talk to the church leaders about offloading some of her duties onto other members."
4,b8qalq,t2_3c7ws1dr,MythicalBeast45,"NTA. It's clear that the rest of the church isn't going to change their minds about welcoming you, so I think it's perfectly fine to not go there if you're uncomfortable. If your mother doesn't know how they've treated you, you should tell her; if she does know, she shouldn't be asking you to do this."
4,aeuvkb,t2_1qilsrlc,Tezariah,"NTA, my ex used to do this for attention, if I objected she'd run to her friends and say I was being mean to her or just make up a conversation entirely, red flag, run and never look back"
4,akeb1y,t2_yyklrd8,saproo,"NTA. But if I’m being honest that cat shouldn’t be allowed out at all. No matter what precautions are taken, domestic cats are a plague of the environment and more often than not get slaughtered either by animals or people. "
4,akeb1y,t2_drt9w,Captain-Tripps,"NTA. First off, who doesn't litter box train their cat? That's just lazy. Second, if the cat is causing problems with the neighbors, she should be willing to go above and beyond to fix it. There is literally nothing stopping the neighbors from calling animal control and reporting a feral cat. If a bell will fix it, something that small should not be an issue. "
4,b40xeo,t2_2hlxsqn2,Sanctimonious_Locke,"NTA. It would be a small gesture for your boyfriend to dress to match, and it really seems to be that he *should* be willing to for the sake of your comfort."
4,b40xeo,t2_2jbhcee2,CrookedHalos,"NTA First, he tells you it's ok to stress in a way he's not even comfortable dressing. Second, he refuses to ease your discomfort but dressing to match. It's very off- putting how he's handling this whole situation. "
4,b40xeo,t2_e9wn07w,BlowsyChrism,NTA That would have made me uncomfortable as well. I am not sure why he didn't tell you he was wearing one? It is just strange to me 
4,b40xeo,t2_3dfsj2dm,GoldenPhoenixRising,YTA. Its a weeding. Let him suit up. Dont make this a big deal over nothing. You had the time to get a suite
4,ao5vlb,t2_2vtmliyu,IMightBeAHamster,"NTA, if it’s happening regularly, and never at either the daughter or the mother, then yes, you probably should call just to make sure nothing goes over the top."
4,ao5vlb,t2_6qnyb,Murdiff,NTA CPS will decide if there is abuse or not. It's much better to call than to not call and risk that a child is being hurt (emotional abuse is also abuse and it sounds like that is exactly what is happening).
4,addlha,t2_1stis7l,crazybunny19,"NTA. He is responsible for making sure his taxes are paid or setting aside funds for it. IF he expected you to be setting money aside for it, he should have clearly communicated that with specific details on how much. He was running his own company, which you weren't involved in, so he was 100% responsible for the tax end of things. I'd be pissed too. "
4,addlha,t2_ci2zd,doradiamond,"NTA. You agreed to manage the household finances, not his business finances. It’s his responsibility to ensure he sets aside enough for tax etc. It’s just like if he had a normal wage... the company is responsible for making sure there is enough set aside for taxes, not you."
4,addlha,t2_16gu49,acrylicvigilante_,"YTA. Only because if my partner tells me they're taking care of the finances, I assume that means taxes since tax is a huge part of it. A bit of ESH because both of you should have communicated far better before assuming something so huge."
4,b3ujn6,t2_kyiw6,Cyclot,YTA. It sounds like she responded as soon as she was able to process what was going on. And even though she said she didn't need an ambulance didn't mean she didn't need any emotional support in that moment so you shouldn't have defaulted to anger.
4,b3ujn6,t2_munzn,GbMaxSE,"YTA - You sound like a dense fool who doesn't know what sleep paralysis is. She probably could not respond to you. Furthermore, your telling her what you told her is a bold faced admission that you care far more about your own happiness and comfort than hers. Aka you're selfish. Which seems like the truth."
4,atvvn9,t2_2sw4bedd,actualdisasterbi,"NAH - There are plenty of people I refer to as ""friends"" that are really more acquantainces born out of us happening to be in the same place at the same time. "
4,b1p9iy,t2_zjiqk,Andie757,NTA Just be honest with your friend. They're just keeping up something that you both used to do and it probably hasn't occurred to them that it doesn't hold the same interest for you.
4,avwh4v,t2_28dk2fkj,Delanes_Brain,"NTA: I've always felt it should be asked ahead of time if someone wants to celebrate a bday at work if thats something a workplace does. A card signed by everyone....sure, but not a full on party. I wouldn't even say using a sick day would make you an asshole. Say it's a mental health day because that's pretty much what it would be fore."
4,avwh4v,t2_2qwwz0a7,empressofdogs,"NTA. It's disrespectful not to take people's preferences into consideration when setting a workplace policy like this. At my workplace we have a form you can fill out to indicate whether or not you want your birthday and work anniversary celebrated, and your wishes are respected. And you can change your preference at any time."
4,ai2xw4,t2_tcwbi7,brandyto,"NTA. He didn’t even send you a proper invitation, although it sounds like he has sent actual paper invites to others. Even if he had, an invitation is not a command. Plenty of people decline to travel out of country for weddings. "
4,ai2xw4,t2_27wla2dq,SubjectiveAssertive,"NTA - Personally I'd go, Poland can have stupid cheap flights from the UK and there is a few places out there I'd like to visit. But he has handled your friendship incredibly badly 12 years just sorta over because he met a woman? The guy is a bit of a tool."
4,b02ce1,t2_1qbgxh4c,Palerthanghosts,NTA. You were very much within your rights to do so and to not live in a place full of holes.
4,b9ymhl,t2_1zzfidu1,renatogg,"NTA. Would you be the asshole for telling water is wet? Serisously though, attraction and preference is okay, but should be hand in hand with who one would date. "
4,b5i66b,t2_udn93bt,eeveeyeee,"NTA. You've actually handled that very eloquently, I wouldn't take it any further, just let him play the victim if he wants. I would speak with the gym staff discreetly and let them know to look out for any weird behaviours from him. But there's not much more to be said. (Obviously if your gf's still uncomfortable and he escalates it further, take it to the police). He sounds like a Nice Guy, to be honest."
4,aep1y7,t2_zr7v6,RedFloodles,"NTA for wanting to take the job - sometimes you gotta look out for number 1, and you're definitely not an asshole for doing so when, as you say, you don't have any financial commitments or dependents. However, you have to be prepared to accept that this might be a deal breaker for you partner. Long distance is no picnic. Would you be okay with that?"
4,aggijw,t2_27ea4lh0,Nazism_Was_Socialism,"NTA. The government is a leech and therefore should be leeched off as much as possible. You're just getting back some of your hard earned money it has stolen, and will continue to steal, from you in the form of taxes and inflation."
4,affiwd,t2_2pcgat6i,alittlealexis11,"NTA, just because she has mental issues does not give her the right to physically assault you. Your mother is the asshole for letting it happen and excepting you when you were a teenager/young adult to take care of her like that. Obviously, she doesn’t respond well to authority if she’s been in and out of Juvenile detention centers. I’m sorry for what you went through, but again no you’re not the asshole. And, your mother should understand why you feel the way you do towards your sister."
4,b72w8f,t2_10xh1q,DClawdude,"NTA. You are entitled to set healthy boundaries including with family. You are entitled to want time to yourself with nobody else around. Sounds like you're under 18 which means, basically, you don't actually have the level of privacy rights as an adult. Sucks your parents act like they don't trust you though or are super controlling. Nothing you can do til you're an adult though. "
4,adasdz,t2_k823i,NorthAndEastTexan,"NTA It potentially sounds like your best friend failed to communicate these plans to her husband, and you ended up paying for it. That's not fair to you. Is this the first time she's backed out of a scheduled get together? If this is abnormal behavior, maybe something is going on? "
4,ak9cda,t2_33b8vrhn,CriticalJudge,"NTA - You're allowed to request whatever you want from your partner and no one outside your relationship should ever interfere. It's for you two to figure out... That being said, it seems like your relationship has some grey areas that need to be addressed prior to your wedding. Setting some ground rules today may very well save your marriage 5-10 years from now."
4,ak9cda,t2_2jb3dth,Gerald_Michaels,"NTA, You should talk the issue out with your fiance and let her know that you aren't comfortable with Derek being an usher in order to prevent further problems"
4,ak9cda,t2_2e7yk7ho,somedudetoyou,NTA but by god this sounds like a powder keg on top of a landmine coated in napalm just waiting for a wet fart to set it off.
4,b9xtxo,t2_tcwbi7,brandyto,"NTA. Even in a communal fridge, people have the right to buy and save their own food via sticky note. This is doubly true for pregnant women, people with food allergies and or special restaurant leftovers. At 15, your brother is old enough to understand that the Jello is not his, and can chose something else to eat."
4,9wxkqq,t2_21asixxi,BeefBot9000,"Any time you intentionally surprise another driver, yta. Even if one out of a thousand does something that causes an injury or death, you could have avoided it."
4,9wxkqq,t2_1k6gtf5,internettroll3002,"YTA, this is risky behavior. While they are wrong for running the light, killing them for it would be infinitely worse which makes creating the risk of killing them that of the behavior of an asshole at least."
4,b4kaz2,t2_2esm5mrv,VamosRams,I’m usually to work by 5 and even I would be agitated at getting a call at 4:30 am unless it was an emergency (I wouldn’t consider drunk an emergency). NTA this guy sounds like a creep
4,b4kaz2,t2_7g2q9,teeleer,NTA Some days I'm up at 5-6am for work and I don't even text or IM people that early because I assume they are awake. The only exception is if they are in a different time zone and are a few hours ahead
4,b4kaz2,t2_36my7rol,FractalEldritch,"NTA. 4 am, you haven't seen the guy in 4 years, and on top of that he refused to cease after three times."
4,b4kaz2,t2_1p4pxukw,californyeahyeahyeah,NTA - Something to remember is sometimes people call at odd hours because they're reaching out for help. I always pick up just in case and if it's not urgent let them know that I'm trying to get some rest and will return their call when it's convenient.
4,b4kaz2,t2_10uwve,MrFluffPants1349,"NTA, he clearly has no sense of boundaries, especially since he made it about his *surprise* instead of apologizing like a decent person. Your co-workers are also incredibly ignorant for saying your response was rude. I sincerly doubt they would handle it with more grace than you did. You should call them at 4am and see how polite they are about it. "
4,b4kaz2,t2_phiaq,PsycoticANUBIS,"NTA. This is pretty fucking civil for someone who has just been woken up and is pissed off. I would have said things that are much, much worse."
4,b4kaz2,t2_21gc947d,whosthatwierdo,"NTA, unless someones dying or youre in actual danger its not ok to be calling anyone at 4:30am, especially not some random that you barely knew years ago just to catch up, who does that?"
4,b4kaz2,t2_amzbz,da_chicken,"NTA and your coworkers are weird. I'd have responded slightly differently. I'd have answered on the third call and asked what the emergency was. When he told me there was no emergency, I'd have told him to fuck off and been furious. Calling at 4:30 am is seriously rude. "
4,b4kaz2,t2_2e5f2j94,nour926,"NTA. Even if you’re an early riser and the other person knows that, it’s not really proper decorum to call someone at 4:30 in the morning. Hell, even the concept of an 8am meeting is frowned upon. "
4,b4kaz2,t2_2ojn39oh,ratsassgiveidont,"YTA. If your sleep hygiene is that important to you, why aren't you setting your phone to Do Not Disturb (or whatever your device's option is)? The rest of the world isn't responsible for memorizing your daily sleep cycle, and we are a 24 hour society now. I have only my important people included in my Favourites, to enable them to break through the Do Not Disturb in case of emergencies. And really, unless you have someone with a known pending chance for emergency (e.g. critical illness or pre-advised necessary travel in a dicey area), it's still not necessary to be on call. There's always someone else they can contact."
4,az7xly,t2_59lcd,Korrin,"NTA. He was being absolutely ridiculous, and honestly that level of immaturity and spitefulness is very troubling. If he's done stuff like this before you should honestly consider how much you want to date an abusive child."
4,av4so5,t2_f23gl,Iisham,"YTA only because of your friend. They stuck out their neck and got you a stable job in time of need. Personally I would go for the higher pay, but wouldn't have any illusions about it not fucking my friend over in the process. "
4,av4so5,t2_7ojjg,techiesgoboom,YTA - specifically only to your friend that vouched for you. Now leaving the company after even 1 day is perfectly fine. If it was in their financial interest they would fire you in a heartbeat. But doing so might negatively impact your friend that got you your current job and would be a dick move to that friend. So in this by them and see what they have to say.
4,av4so5,t2_2wv6u4dh,IntrovertedShutIn,"NTA. At the end of the day, it's a job. You go where the pay and benefits are best. Make sure it's stable, the pay is written in the contract and that you definitely have the new job and go for it. A 5x salary increase is huge. I would kick myself for passing it up if I were you."
4,av4so5,t2_8by985k,robbini3,"YTA, not for screwing your company but for screwing your friend who put his name and reputation on the line with his company to get you the job only to turn around and do exactly what he said you wouldn't do."
4,av4so5,t2_16ox39,illusions_in_life,"NTA - your primary responsibility is to yourself, not a company. The manager is the asshole, if the company needed to cut you they would without batting an eye. "
4,av4so5,t2_16oz8a,iliveinacavern,"NTA. You don't owe your company that loyalty. You didnt sign a contract saying youd stay there forever. while it's a nice dream for a business to hire long term employees, if they dont offer what it takes to retain you, they shouldnt expect you to stay. Take the job that's better for you. I'd expect your current employer may be salty so maybe dont rely on them for a positive reference."
4,av4so5,t2_2wkson8t,waman2k7,"NTA like people have said its business for you nothing personal 5x your salary is a shitload of money. Make sure the offer is for sure, give your current company your 2 weeks and start living the good life since you will be making so much more money "
4,b0op5y,t2_1289o2,Uijoonbug,"NTA but does your boyfriend have an autism diagnosis? What he describes is very common for people with autism and they don't always understand emotions or emotional arguments. Either way, this is how he is and it isn't likely bro change. You'll have to decide if you can be ok with that."
4,auckbi,t2_3bdh0a6,Wickedsymphony1717,"NTA 100% NTA. Don't succumb to religious bullying, whether it's from your family or strangers. The only assholes in this situation are the people who would force a belief system onto another person, especially their own child. Your dad needs a reality check (pun intended)."
4,auckbi,t2_2sv5vr25,_JustSayin,"NTA - Definately don't apologise. You have just described an abusive parent. A parent's job is to make sure their child is healthy and happy, yours is clearly not concerned with either of these. Authorities probably won't do much since mental abuse is not considered as serious as physical abuse, but if you can it sounds like it's time for you to move out. (Can you stay with a friend whose parents are less delusional??). "
4,auckbi,t2_yw37,generic230,"NTA. Maybe a little for exploding like that. I understand why you did, I mean you’re essentially a prisoner to your dad’s beliefs. But it did you no favors. Good on you for getting out. "
4,afhrso,t2_162jkw,Doc233XD,"NTA. You weren’t completely engaged but you had more important things to do, it’s generally better to try to engage people but you weren’t just screwing around and ignoring them. "
4,angjy3,t2_1xtd9gx2,Cent1234,"NTA but you'll have a hard time believing that. If you honestly believe she's being abused, inform the authorities, and wash your hands of the situation; you're not prepared or qualified to deal with this stuff. If you honestly believe she isn't being abused, just stop associating with her. If she starts to try to play guilt games with you, simply inform her that if she's in crisis, she should contact the police or local mental health services, and you truly hope that she gets whatever help she needs, but you cannot provide that help. Repeat as necessary."
4,b6d0ks,t2_7ojjg,techiesgoboom,"NTA Seriously, he needs smokes and beer and you think you might be the asshole for not paying for those? That's insane, of course you did nothing wrong. Even if he needed food that's what food banks are for. You have no moral obligation to ever lend anyone money."
4,b6d0ks,t2_nxd80,lyre34,"NTA, while I appreciate that he put the money into his kid's little league, I'm pretty sure he could have spaced things out, and knowingly scraped a bit together by skipping a case of beer here or there. "
4,b6d0ks,t2_2gkzok2q,randert,"NTA - but the first rule of loaning money is don't loan money. If you want to give money when you are able and want to, fine. But never give it with the expectation of getting it back. This will mitigate your disappointment in the future when it does not come back or the same person does not step up when you need it. "

4,a6mp5p,t2_zrf6f,liz4prez2028,"NTA. You have a right to quiet enjoyment of your residence. There is also likely local noise ordinances, which your neighbor is violating. It does not make you an asshole to call the police so the ordinance is enforced if your apartment will not help. You’ve given them plenty of chances, so it’s time to escalate the matter."
4,a6mp5p,t2_367fk,thebornotaku,"NTA. Noise violations and limits exist for a reason. The reason being ""so people can sleep"". The exact issue you're having. Continue to pressure whoever you need to (police, apartment complex, them directly) until they get the clue and knock it off."

4,b2417c,t2_mi8cbqp,crystalinguini,NTA. This is some r/justnoMIL shit. What baffles me the most is that she outright tried to trade in your car with no notice other than a quick phone call. YOUR car. I genuinely don’t understand why you caved in to something like that and if anything your mother should be paying for the difference of the car insurance. Not your daughter. She put you in such a shitty position. That pisses me off.
4,a4lpmh,t2_gkd3q,CaedoGenesis,"It's concerning how invested your mother is in you handing out money to those that have helped you in the past, be wary of this if it extends to other people OP, could be a guilt maneuver.

4,aysv7i,t2_491o6c5,pm_me_xayah_porn,"YTA Little ceasars is fucking disgusting pizza and I'd literally rather just go hungry than get it, but your comments here are pretty bad. You get aggressive anytime anyone remotely disagrees with you and immediately attack them while saying stuff like ""WHAT AM I THE ASSHOLE BECAUSE I HAVE MANNERS?"". Your friend isn't overreacting to just this instance, he's finally yelling at you for YEARS of you acting like a dick to him."
4,aysv7i,t2_ojhtc,TurnOneSolRing,"YTA. Read the comments. This guy really needs to work on his interpersonal skills. It's not even about the food, which your short-tempered ass is so focused on. You clearly have little tolerance for people that disagree with you. "
4,acpcxn,t2_t9vj8,CrashGordon94,"YTA, for the attitude. Would've been NAH if you had just said no or even that you were busy/in a bad state, it's the mumbling through and dismissiveness that really changes it."

4,b22xg9,t2_13l4ik,Deadly9750,"NTA. The law is the law, don't mess with it. Good on you for standing you're ground, you didn't feel comfortable in the situation and did not want to cave into their demands. Your friends shouldn't insult you or demean you for not being their dd when they want to drink underage. Grab an Uber it's easy and cheap to split a bill several ways. "

4,aayx81,t2_zq8bs,thinkevolution,"NTA. You have a private dance group made up of girls. This person identifies as a man though they were born a female.

4,aayx81,t2_p6o96m6,nwi210,"NTA Trans men identify as male. Therefore, you were in the right. On a side note, I’m not sure this person is trans. Trans people generally go to lengths to disconnect them from their biological sex. He wouldn’t ask to join something that’s only for people of his biological sex if he was truly trans. I could be wrong though, so take this with a grain of salt. "
4,aayx81,t2_11rdbden,pepicant,"NTA. He either can be treated as a man who, because they are a man, does not fit the requirements of the group. Or he can be treated as a woman, which imo would be degrading to his preferred gender and grating for everyone involved. "
4,a099ce,t2_kutp0mr,kitticatmeow1,"NTA. You have a very healthy view of relationships and stick to your guns.

4,a46cgz,t2_9a2sa,Thunder_bird,"NTA. You have an obligation to yourself, and your family to manage your career in the way that's best for you. It sounds as if the firm has already been abusing your goodwill and hard work as it is. It's perfectly okay to schedule your move that's optimal for you. Also your move's timing is probably optimal for your new employer. Why should they be inconvenienced because your current firm cannot retain staff? BTW, 4 weeks' notice is exceedingly generous imho.

And this: >I'm the manager of a department and the only one in the company that has my skill set If the big bosses valued their employees properly and staffed their company accordingly, it wouldn't be a big deal for you to leave.

4,a46cgz,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"NTA. NOPE. You don't owe that company jack diddly shit. You gave them ample notice, as per your contract, and that's all you owe them. Don't feel guilty for getting out and taking care of yourself and your family. "
4,9uouyt,t2_zmjh74j,Bangbangsmashsmash,"NTA, but you have learned a valuable lesson about lending money, they were irresponsible enough that they couldn’t afford their bills, and they didn’t learn a lesson about it because you bailed them out.

4,9uouyt,t2_9tvzukr,FrostyJannaStorm,"NTA, but I don't see why she can't also pay his part. She's your daughter, but they shouldn't be splitting the bill if one can't actually provide their split. If she complains, tell her that maybe if he worked and paid, she wouldn't feel like it's unfair."
4,9uouyt,t2_e7dyu74,jollycello,"NTA, but maybe you could have expressed your sentiments in a way that would still convey the truth without having to offend your daughter so much.

4,9uouyt,t2_13j73z,Carliebeans,"NTA. Being philosophical about what money is wouldn’t fly with her rental agency or bill collectors, it would get her electricity cut off and homeless. They apparently had no issue borrowing the money and they should pay it back."
4,9uouyt,t2_4ydeu,ItsGotToMakeSense,"NTA. Unless there's way more to the story than you're letting on, you have the moral high ground here. You told them the terms of the loan and they're choosing to cut ties from you when held accountable for it. That's all on them. (However that's a pretty big ""unless"" I started with. There are many way you *could* be the asshole here.)"

I feel like you're entitled to quietly leave him rn if you want, but not to pressure him to make major decisions rn or berate him in a way that further degrades his mental health.

4,aqm72m,t2_5mow4,Lordica,"YTA- a wallet is a highly personal gift. His choices were either to put it in the back of his drawer and never used thus wasting your money, or ask you to return it.

4,a8qrp3,t2_2hpp19wh,esscuchi,"NTA Even though your mother burned bridges with the rest of your family, they still should have offered to pay. If they love you, then they should sympathize with your loss and support you by helping cover the funeral expenses. $4000 is a big bill to foot on your own"
4,a8qrp3,t2_162jkw,Doc233XD,"NTA. Asking them for financial help does not make you an asshole. As long as you weren’t rude to them and accepted their decision not to help because ultimately it is their life and money, you’re not the asshole. "
4,a8qrp3,t2_4h063,dreadneck,"NTA AT ALL. What you did was commendable, and unfortunately, not necessary. You could have had just a cremation probably for less. And all those other people, especially your rich grandparents, should be ASHAMED for not helping. I hope my kid has your sense of duty when he gets older, not that I want or need him to pay for my funeral. Seems like some of your family doesn't deserve you. "
4,auk27c,t2_7g6ezjl,FIVE_DARRA_NO_HARRA,"YTA. You’re not “recovered” if you had drug problems in the last half of 2018, and your mom is doing the right thing.

4,abms7w,t2_zmjh74j,Bangbangsmashsmash,"Awww, NTA, I was about to say it was an absent minded mistake, but her response was wrong. I accidentally fed a vegan something non vegan, and with a quick apology it was settled. "
4,abms7w,t2_1grnby08,ohhlookshiny,"NTA. Its your choice how you want your child fed, you even went the extra mile to provide separate food and not inconvenience anyone. I eat meat myself, but would totally respect anyone else's dietary choices. Your host was the asshole for not respecting your diet and what you want your child to be eating. Even worse, she didnt even do it by mistake which might be forgivable, but she did it on purpose, then owned it and doubled down on her belief when confronted. "
4,abms7w,t2_11vqw97s,AnotherLolAnon,"NTA. If your daughter is happy, healthy, and eating a balanced diet you're doing well. I dare say most vegans eat a more well balanced diet than the general population due to their closer attention to what they eat. "
4,abms7w,t2_1m5ladwu,Silly_bubble_bug,"NTA. The mom was disrespectful she shouldn’t get away with it. Some people think that all vegans force their lifestyle on their kids, which isn’t true. It doesn’t matter if you raise your kids vegan or non-vegan, just as long as you encourage them to try both sides and make their own informed decisions that make them happy. "
4,abms7w,t2_1ll1l9b,MuricanIdle,"NTA. Your boyfriend’s mother’s behavior was appalling, but you handled the situation well. You should definitely have a conversation with her about this. She was totally out of line and she owes you and your daughter an apology. "
4,arovt8,t2_11fe0oeh,Dietcokeisgod,"Personally NTA - it's not the same because the predominant activity with horse racing is to bet but it's not the same with football. Plus if it's just about racing, then why show him a betting form?"
4,arovt8,t2_tqw4an2,thesquirrelmasta,NTA. If you dont want to introduce your child to gambling than any reasonable person should respect that. Trying to use other sports that don't revolve around gambling to justify thier reasoning is just sad
4,arovt8,t2_xo53k,TheHootingLance,NTA it's up to you when your kid learns about gambling. Even if you tell your kid the general idea that's probably fine but there's no real need to go into detail about it
4,b9ulv7,t2_1zzfidu1,renatogg,"In my opinion NTA. Still sort of a dick move, but she brought it on herself. Also I think she might not consider the friendship the same way you do... but that’s only my opinion based on a single interaction that we got to listen from your perspective. "
4,b9ulv7,t2_13bfdq,GarnetsAndPearls,"NTA- It's not petty, it's following the rules. It needs to happen now, so that it doesn't jeopardize housing for you and the other roomate. Talk to her first. She's putting her roomates at risk for a fine and her job at risk. Just because she works for the apartment building, doesn't mean she can ignore the rule, and not incurr the fee. You're not the asshole."
4,b0pkn7,t2_cr4b6,merpsicle,NTA. My parents are divorced and when I was a kid I had a separate party at each parents house during their time 
4,b0pkn7,t2_74ylq,Noctourniquet,"NTA. How in the fuck can people not see why this would be a horrible, awkward, inappropriate idea? Divorce happens, why would the families keep mingling? Two parties isn’t the end of the world, how long are you expected the coddle the kid from reality? Ffs..."
4,b0pkn7,t2_2n79ojvl,rescuesquad704,"NTA. It’s perfectly reasonable for there to be separate parties. If you guys got along that would be wonderful, but you’re happy with the bridge that she burned and not looking to rebuild. Like, she couldn’t even come to you herself, apologize, and ask to start coming to events? "
4,b0pkn7,t2_lxcpg,Ragingredblue,"NTA Let them give him a party. Not speaking to you at all, but delivering a message through your kid that they want you to invite them to your house after they've been assholes to you all along? Asshole behavior. Using the kid as a tool to make you look bad? Asshole behavior. Putting you on the spot with your kid? Asshole behavior "
4,b0pkn7,t2_bnh7r,subrhythm,NTA I think letting them come for the sake of you kid is wise BUT if they treated you so badly I can understand you not wanting them there.
4,b0pkn7,t2_f8e165y,Cowgirlsd,"majority of people in this sub arent divorced or know what this is like. nor do I for that matter. imho nta, its your fucking house if you dont want scum there its your prerogative. "
4,b0pkn7,t2_i6cwn34,rayraywest0,YTA I thought this was going to be a safety or some kind of abuse issue. This party is for your son and your son wants his family there. Don’t have a kid with someone if you can’t figure out how to coparent in the even of a separation. (Once again this is barring abuse or safety)
4,b0pkn7,t2_2wj6ad2v,JWJulie,NTA - but you could use this opportunity to put the resentment behind you and start to build bridges for the sake of your sons happiness.
4,b0pkn7,t2_i57sv,shaoting,"NTA, not even in the slightest. Your husband decided to up and leave you and had the full backing of his family. There are tons of divorced couples who still maintain friendly/civil relationships with their former extended families. Anyone bitching about OP taking half are idiots - depending on her state, receiving ""half"" is mandated by divorce courts."
4,b0pkn7,t2_ihzzh,WhatWasThatAbout,NTA - grandma is aware of how she treated you and she should have gently let the kid down. If she wants to make amends this is not the way to start.
4,b0pkn7,t2_p24t0,lindsorb,"NTA here. You don't owe them anything. If they wanted to be included, they should have looked ahead and realized they needed to behave better. They can have their own party."
4,b0pkn7,t2_2215yimg,Spicymayogoddess,NTA dude. They made a choice to be jerks when they could have acted nicely so they could be involved in family events thrown by you. Nothing is stopping them from hosting a birthday for your kid a different day. 
4,abv4ew,t2_wh2sxd1,Alchemyst19,"NTA. Work schedules should be made known at the beginning of the week at the latest. No schedule, no work. If he's gonna run a business, you should expect him to run it like a manager."

4,a6uynt,t2_2fc7pmk2,Vulturedoors,"NTA. Your gf needs serious therapy for even staying in contact with that scumbag, much less being worried that you'll think less of him now that you know he's a child molester. "

4,b9w5ko,t2_2ctnxi35,jbotheunicorn,NTA- that’s a very valid and reasonable reason. Good for you for placing your self care as a priority and not trying to go just to appease her. She should be more respectful.
4,b9w5ko,t2_175929,redditKMC,"NTA - you did nothing wrong, and without being a bridesmaid there would be nothing for her to change (other than possibly seating arrangements). Definitely don't put yourself in a situation that will be triggering. "
4,b9w5ko,t2_11igcq,apathyontheeast,"NTA. I don't know your story nor your resources, but I hope you're able to get the mental health help you would benefit from. Your friend, on the other hand, is lacking significant human empathy. I'm sure she was a bit embarrassed/awkward at first - no person wants to offend their guests - but she's handling it poorly. "
4,b9w5ko,t2_alxztdv,LtDanielTaylor,NTA But only if you have PTSD and this is one of your triggers. If you do not have PTSD YTA because using PTSD as a scapegoat because something upsets you is not okay. I have no judgment about your PTSD only you know and you don’t have to justify anything with me.
4,ad2zwn,t2_11ieja24,blackcurrantcat,"NTA at all. You work, you need to sleep- it's not like sleep is some optional recreational activity, you have to do it. If you move home then you can save money and get somewhere bigger- three of you in a bed is not sustainable long-term anyway."
4,a08e0i,t2_1tu6cnca,The_Frickin_GotG,"NTA. This is exactly how wrecks happen. Look away and miss a red light, or miss brake lights in front of you, or go off the shoulder, etc. If he wants to be a paid driver then he needs to realize that passenger safety and comfortability are top priorities."
4,b0fofq,t2_1ykz1ok3,lost-cannuck,"NTA - there are many occupational health and safety laws that prevent employers from forcing you to do something unsafe. You alone can ensure your safety by practicing safe protocols and procedures. As the senior tech/ training the new hire you are also responsible for his safety. While you may not be his manager, you are still supervising his work. "
4,b0fofq,t2_87cyg,sturmcrow,"NTA rules exist for a reason, and depending on the job is he going to pay your bills while you heal from an injury?"

4,aiv1ng,t2_wqyn0,cernegiant,NTA. Your asking for common courtesy. If it helps I get drug tested for work and I've never pissed hot in the situation you described.
4,b9fnag,t2_1n8km6xn,OneSardine,"LOL all of the titles lately are so clickbait-y. NTA, leaning towards NAH - sounds like a discussion about the hydro bill & expenses, specifically using the numbers and cost, could resolve the issue. It's not like you're shaming her for her crop top - you're just telling her to put on a sweater if she's cold. Not an unreasonable ask."
4,b9fnag,t2_4syg7,ayriana,"NTA. By the title I was going to say YTA, but I've had this conversation with my 15 yo stepdaughter many times this winter. If you're cold, put on a sweatshirt, pants and socks. If you're still cold then consider turning up the heat. "
4,b9fnag,t2_1yh7jrn,Shlikky,NTA - My girlfriend runs the heater constantly and it raises our electric bill by almost $50 a month. She pays that difference because she understands usage. Sounds like your roommate needs to learn how electric bills work.
4,b9fnag,t2_10fhvx,Goldberry42,"NTA. People who turn on the heating instead of putting on a jumper piss me off - not only is it a waste of money, its also a waste of electricity "
4,b9fnag,t2_hsmto,avast2006,NTA -- It is not fair of her to spend your money on heat because she refuses to dress for the weather. Tell her that if she prefers that solution then she should voluntarily take on most of the heating bill.
4,ajxfsq,t2_2z4cj0jm,IgotCarasma,"NTA /YTA YTA if you don't get some counseling. You're punishing yourself, and those in your life, for something you were the victim in and are a survivor of. It's not something to be ashamed of. Allow yourself to lower the walls of protection you've built year after year. My guess is that at least half of those responding to this are rape survivors as well. Shame shouldn't silence us. I'm glad you reached out. Many strangers do give a shit."
4,ajxfsq,t2_2pdckjxt,cold-wasabi,"NTA, you deserve and need your personal space, but you should also work on dealing with things better and reacting in a more peaceful way, ya know? I'm sorry you had to go through that stuff."

4,ajxfsq,t2_yw37,generic230,NTA. You have PTSD. This is what happens when you have PTSD. Please seek help for this. There are amazing new medications and treatments for PTSD now. My good friend was sexually assaulted as a young man (20s) and he has the same set of symptoms. He got into therapy and on medication and is doing better. 
4,ad2su6,t2_21qxl3f5,ShadowChicken032,"NTA, my question is why you didn’t crash the dinner. Every restaurant would have pulled up a chair. Or maybe try to get there when their almost done and suggest everyone goes back to your place? Or to a bar or something? "
4,ahztf9,t2_tcwbi7,brandyto,"NTA. Your brother is in a tough spot, but he is a grown man who needs to get his priorities in order. He’s got a child, is living rent free with your parents and spends all of his money on weed? It’s not your responsibility to provide him housing or to deal with his lack of cleanliness and financial discipline. "
4,ahztf9,t2_29t23ksl,DifficultBison,"NTA. You're not required to let a sibling move in, particularly if you know it will be detrimental to you. I imagine it will also hurt the relationship if/when conflict arises. It may also be very hard to ever get him to leave if you let him move in."
4,ahztf9,t2_1m0abdfm,LivingAtAltitude,"NTA How can you blackmail someone into more child support? The fact that he spends all his money on weed and is a father of three is scary AF. Steer clear because these are all big red flags. He's your brother, not your kid. You're not responsible for him. Don't let him move in."
4,aj3qqi,t2_b9ndflx,Pigeoncoup234,"NTA - absolutely ditch your friends. You gave them more than enough chances. Your only mistake was not giving them hard deadlines so you wouldn't feel bad about this. If you had said, ""let me know by Friday night"", you could have booked guilt free after that and it would only be on them. Still not your fault, though."
4,aj3qqi,t2_10to0e,MildredNatwick,"NTA, if they're not going to step up and give you the very minimal courtesy of a response to your plans, then fuck 'em. And please don't feel bad. If they were dying to go, they would've gotten back to you. The fact that they didn't strongly suggests that they didn't care that much. I hope you & GF go & have a great, relaxing time! "
4,airwhv,t2_7eugspm,ReallyGoodName123,"NTA, that's harsh to imply that you don't deserve it or work hard enough for it. However it's generally best to not talk about salaries unless provoked in order to avoid situations like this"
4,airwhv,t2_8ftv1,LFCBru,"NTA. She's taking out her insecurities on you. In the future, I would just approach discussions about salary a little more carefully. I don't think you did anything wrong here since you said you guys had been talking about the process for a while, but it can be a big divider for some people. Personally, I think it's ridiculous because I want to see all my friends prosper, but others use it as a measure of their own self-worth."
4,airwhv,t2_c1fnc,kaiomi,"NTA, you should be able to discuss these kinds of things with your friends. I have found discussing salaries with my friends helpful as it has made me realize that I have sometimes been underpaid for similar positions. Edit: should note that it’s generally not appropriate to ASK how much someone makes, but I don’t see an issue in offering your own."
4,aulzij,t2_2wt0m1dc,TheRealBillSteele,"NTA. I’m assuming all this is court approved time that you’ve agreed to and you worked hard to make the time spent with the children good quality time. She, on the other hand, finds it important only when it is convenient for her. Definitely NTA and keep what is yours, yours."
4,aulzij,t2_16l92h,Fauxe_y,"NTA - both parents sound have the rights to see their kids... in this case on an equal basis. If she is missing out on that time then that is purely her issue, but she should not use that as ammunition to take your time away from your kids. I think she is being selfish - you are clearly the stable parent in your daughters' lives and she should respect that. "
4,aulzij,t2_emcns,Odeon42,NTA - It seems that you may need to go back and renegotiate custody. If you have been doing more and spending more then it's not fair to you to have a 50/50 custody agreement.
4,9v67pn,t2_zgedy7o,kalelovescats,"NTA, if you foresee an intimate relationship you have a right to know what you're getting into. The part that could make you an asshole is if you were rude about it or treated her differently (excluding not continuing to pursue a romantic/sexual relationship)."
4,aqh7w1,t2_2y5392a5,3Dbigmac,"TIL couples with one autistic child have an increased chance (~15%) of having another. That being said, NTA. It is a roll of the dice that I might be willing to take if I really wanted another kid but it's just going to be a conversation you have to settle with your wife. "
4,aqh7w1,t2_1yuu7lrt,The-Wise-Old-Sage,"NTA - it sounds like you already have SO much on your plate with the one kid, it wouldn’t be fair to you guys to bring in another one. I’m not sure of the probability of getting another child with autism, but even if the second didn’t, you wouldn’t be able to focus on them as much and would be able to handle both of them."
4,aqh7w1,t2_15ap42,_Risings,"NTA. Having a child or not is one of those things that are never a wrong or right choice. It’s a personal choice that you’re entitled to make for any reason and this is a good one. It’s entirely understandable, just as your wife’s side is as well but stand your grounds."
4,aqh7w1,t2_krtbw,LaoSh,"NTA choosing to bring a life into the world is one of the most serious questions imaginable. Even if your hypothetical next child was born with no conditions you wouldn't be able to dedicate the time and energy to them that they need while you are caring for your autistic child. This would not be fair on anyone, least of all yourself."
4,aqh7w1,t2_1acbkrnx,MountainLou,NTA. Also for yourselves. It's OK to not want a second child as it would be very hard bringing up 2 kids with the same difficulties. Have you done any reading into how likely it would be for your second child to have autism?
4,aqh7w1,t2_2sut0bx7,wickedflowers,"Nta, OBVIOUSLY, but if you want another kid, maybe look into adoption! If you adopt an older kid, you can be sure they won't have the same issues as this son. Of course, every kid has their own issues, but none as extreme as this."
4,aqh7w1,t2_ridn7,Stinkehund1,"NTA. It's a good decision and the opposite of selfishness. Willingly bringing a kid into the world, knowing full well they may have a very difficult life ahead of them, that would be the selfish thing to do."
4,aqh7w1,t2_9eti3,KatFrog,"NTA You also probably don't have time for another child, at least not until you can work through a lot of the problems with your son. Please stick to your guns and don't bring another child into this world. If you and you wife really want another child, adopt one. "
4,aqh7w1,t2_h05hv,gingerneko,"NTA. Raising a special needs child is probably as hard as raising 2 'typical' kids, and honestly, if there's a risk of another child having a similar condition, it's fair to say you don't want to take on that responsibility or put another kid through it. That's compassionate realism. "
4,aqh7w1,t2_2nbvdp02,wrathandpride,"NTA, but your wife needs a professional help if she wants another child. Just arguing with her yourself is not enought to convince her at the moment."
4,b8bq9y,t2_2itu8p55,WholockA113,"NTA There is a difference between inconveniencing someone and permanently damaging their mattress and making their room temporarily uninhabitable. With that being said, he may not b aware he screwed up."
4,9x431u,t2_1rlqmeir,a1337sti,"nta - maybe tell her you look forward to fixing the rift, which she can help greatly by following your sons bed time and rules. "
4,b7g9h7,t2_10xh1q,DClawdude,"NTA. If you don’t like physical affection and especially if you have an actual condition that legitimately makes you averse to it, she should be the adult/parent and respect that vs insisting you cater to her preferences, regardless of cultural norms. "
4,b7g9h7,t2_16hhga,kneesee,"NTA. You're 100% allowed to set your own boundaries. It's a shame that your mom isn't more sensitive to your diagnosis, but frankly it's beside the point. If that level of physical/emotional contact makes you uncomfortable and you've explained everything to her half as well as you did here, she should be doing everything she can to make you comfortable. I find her reaction to be wholly inappropriate. Im sorry. Good luck to you, dear."
4,b7g9h7,t2_1zmiz2hn,WildRetard9049,NTA wanting personal space is normal IMO and you’ve expressed your feelings to your mother before but she still does what you dislike
4,b47s9v,t2_1fa79a,bmf09598,"NTA. In relationships, sometimes you have to put your foot down. She's completely taking advantage of you which is a dangerously slippery slope because then it leads to you having to do more for her to appreciate you."
4,b47s9v,t2_1pu4h4zm,bobtheorangecat,"NTA She needs to take responsibility for herself. That being said, if I were you, I'd keep on top of that birth control. Because it seems like the last thing you'd want from this woman is a/another kid."
4,b47s9v,t2_gwx7t,HotDealsInTexas,"NTA. All of her behavior is self-centered and taking advantage of you. But this part takes the cake. > She absolutely refuses to take partial responsibility to try and remember to take her birth control. RUN, don't walk, before you end up trying to raise an unwanted child with someone who refuses to take responsibility for even the tiniest aspects of your own life. "
4,b9whjf,t2_16wqbq,The_Buttslammer,"**NTA** Your family can either accept you as you, or they can go away. Figure out a clever way to let them know, and follow it up a bit later with the whole wedding thing. If they don't want to accept it, that's their loss, and likely your gain."
4,b9whjf,t2_7217s,umbrasolaris,"NTA Your parents don't have the right to manage your relationship with other people. You should be able to interact how you wish with your extended family. It's big of you to be concerned over the difficulty it might cause your parents, but frankly it's not your problem. The reality is that you're gay, and you're entitled to share/celebrate that with whomever you want. Your parents don't have to be happy about it, but they don't have publishing rights on your sexuality. I hope your extended family comes around, and your parents accept your decision. Congrats on your impending marriage!"
4,a8e7pv,t2_18a48bu0,kwneumann,NTA. But your sister is. Why does her feeding herself require a conference and complex negotiations with multiple people? Tell her to grow up and find her own fucking alimentary sustenance
4,b1266d,t2_2rlv6y9o,InappropriateEnergy,NTA but I wouldn't reccomend surrendering the dog behind her back. That's a huge breach of trust. I wouldn't hesitate to put my child's safety over a dog and my partner's feelings though. Your wife isn't being responsible with her dog or her child by ignoring it.
4,b1266d,t2_114wwg,MyTitsAreRustled,"NTA, your child's safety comes first and it's too bad your wife won't acknowledge that. The fact that she refuses to train it is a huge red flag that indicates she should not own a pet."
4,b1266d,t2_1034iqxq,kimboslicetho,This is a hard one because it’s not the dogs fault your wife is lazy and wouldn’t train him. And by surrendering him and because of what’s happened it’s a likely death sentence. Your NTA but your wife absolutely is.
4,b1266d,t2_22l25z2m,kleeinny,"NTA Can your MIL take the dog? Not only is this a potentially dangerous situation for your son, he might be afraid of dogs if this continues, and that’s sad. Definitely have a come to Jesus talk with your wife, and if she still won’t budge, I think this is definitely a possible dealbreaker. "
4,b1266d,t2_3nni6,weemee,NTA. Let your wife know that the scars in my fifty year old face are almost unnoticeable from the time I got bit by a dog as a two year old. She never really cared for this dog because she never made sure to train it properly. I’m not sure she really cares about your child. She’s a total asshole. 
4,b1266d,t2_32j60nol,7evenh3lls,"NTA, there is no excuse (absolutely none) for keeping an aggressive dog around a toddler. Dog owners are often completely delusional about their precious ticking time bombs and the damage even small dogs can do! In your position, I'd surrender it somewhere FAR AWAY (get a friend to do it) and then pretend it ran away during a walk or something...."
4,b1266d,t2_53y95e,LucidOutwork,"NTA But you should calm down and have a few more conversations before you get rid of the dog. Talk to your wife again. Potentially talk to your MIL and get her opinion and advice as well, since she seems to know the dog and might have ideas on who could take it. It is not a safe situation to continue to have the dog there with your son -- be extra careful until you get it figured out."
4,b1266d,t2_482ldmk,need2know25,"NTA - the dog bit your son, I would call up animal services and see what can be done - hopefully they will make the decision for you. Your child always comes before the dog."
4,b1266d,t2_348k211,phantomstrange,"At the moment, NTA. The dog is aggressive, untrained, and a danger to your small child. Your wife is unwilling to train the dog/resolve the issue, which makes her the asshole. On the other hand, if you get rid of the dog behind her back, you would also be an asshole. Be up front and honest about your intentions."
4,b1266d,t2_1to0qqa2,MikkiTh,NTA It sounds like the dog is past the point of retraining & is probably impatient with kids since it is older. Generally this is when you rehome a pet. 
4,b1266d,t2_i6cwn34,rayraywest0,NTA you need to sit down with your wife and ask why the dog is more important than the safety of your child. 
4,b1266d,t2_2fxpe4l,PhoenixSheriden,"NTA. In case OP needs to go nuclear to protect the baby, take your kid to the doctor now. Make certain the child is not hurt, but it also helps start a paper trail in case CPS or a child custody case need to happen."
4,b9kr96,t2_sft62,Hesh_From_Texas,"NTA, they would drop and forget you at the first good chance given to them most likely, don't feel bad for looking our for #1, you."
4,b9kr96,t2_nxd80,lyre34,"NTA as long as you fulfill the stipulations of your contract. At 20, you will no doubt have many more jobs in the future, and many more situations like this. Good employers may feel hurt that you leave, but they shouldn't begrudge you for doing so."
4,b5ugbq,t2_bg4sp,Killairmanable,"NTA x1000 Your brother is a textbook abusive POS, degrading you then apologizing for their behaviour with the expectation that you'll forgive them. When you don't, they get angry again because their strategy didn't work. Your brother needs to go to anger management, and you owe him nothing."
4,b5ugbq,t2_rsoto,eatthebunnytoo,"NTA and the fact he actually controls his behavior enough in front of others and when you filme shows just what an abusive monster he is. Maybe try keeping your phone recording in your pocket and take the outburst straight to a school counselor or better yet, the cops."
4,b5swgw,t2_ks60qx8,SugarFetish,NTA - I don’t get why parents think they get to have kids and make someone else responsible for it. I’m the youngest of 6 and even my parents didn’t ask as much from 1 sibling as yours are doing. 
4,b5swgw,t2_1qabgzef,ComprehensiveWriter6,NTA - i had a similar situation growing up but I didn't mind it so much and it made me a better person in a way and having a kid of my own was a breeze. 
4,b5swgw,t2_39dh1e3f,parduhne,NTA You didn't give birth to them so you aren't their parent. And sisterly duties are a load of crap especially since your other siblings aren't being held to the same standard. Try and set some boundaries with your parents because this is super unfair to you.
4,b5swgw,t2_15v4p2,ecxetra,"NTA, he is not your responsibility. Your parents decided to have him so it is solely their responsibility to look after him. You are not indebted to your parents either, they chose to have you. Having them raise and look after you was not a privilege. "
4,b5swgw,t2_cqnuci,FloatingPencil,"NTA. Move out, as soon as possible. I know it's probably not going to be easy. But you're not in a good situation now, they're taking advantage of you, and it's probably going to continue. "
4,b5swgw,t2_1ogaim0t,PTSDinosaur,"NTA. I know you said you can't move out, but do you have any friends who would be willing to take you in on a short term basis so you can save for a new place? Once your no longer being a surrogate parent, you can start working more hours or find a better paying job."
4,b5swgw,t2_ipdjwal,star_guardian_carol,NTA - these are responsibilities that should never have fallen to you. You were a child. And those are not your children. NOW you could offer to help a bit. This is how I was raised too. It is not your job. I left at 18 and never looked back.
4,atitsh,t2_p61tg,BeesSolveEverything,"NTA. You gave them several opportunities to contribute. When they refused, you spoke with the professor to resolve the problem. You did everything right and handled it like an adult. Yeah, they're mad at you, but you know what? Fuck 'em. They brought this on themselves."
4,atitsh,t2_bkq2k3h,SilentSchitter,"NTA. I was in a group project and one member contributed nothing. Absolutely nothing. Never met with us during the meeting times, or on weekends. We let the professor know and we got graded separately on our group project because of it. If they’re not pulling their weight, why should you have to do all the work and they only reap the rewards?"
4,atitsh,t2_140wll,Abby-N0rma1,"NTA they didn't put in the work, so they don't get credit. if they really cared, they'd just do it themselves for their grade now"
4,atjoi5,t2_zmjh74j,Bangbangsmashsmash,"NTA. If you can earn enough money at it to pay your bills, it’s a career, if not, it is a hobby and you need to go find a career."
4,afw3gt,t2_9yunowa,daisiesanddaffodils,"NTA. What's the alternative? You allow him to harass you because he ""doesn't understand"" he shouldn't? He's a danger to you and the other women on the team, regardless of what he understands if he doesn't know how to keep his hands to himself, especially when he's told multiple times. "
4,b6mwj4,t2_2voh606z,max_and_friends,"NTA, she's a professional and she's just as capable of reading the contract terms as you are. If she couldn't deliver what she promised, she shouldn't have signed the contract and accepted your payment."
4,b6mwj4,t2_7sraf,MorganaLeFaye,"NTA - She didn't live up to her end of the contract. You are not the asshole. Further to telling her you are unhappy, you should insist that she fulfil her end of the agreement or give you your money back. As someone who had a similar experience with a couple of my vendors, I'd also advise that if she doesn't fully compensate you, that you leave reviews on wedding forums and review sites. Seriously. Other people need to know what kind of person they'd be dealing with before booking them for their own weddings. "
4,av2min,t2_32h1wyqd,IreadalotofArguments,"NTA, I deliver food in a place called wisconsin. Not sure where you live but its known for being cold and miserable in winter. 20% is more than most people give and certainly fair . I was stiffed 4 times last night in 4°F weather. Fuck that driver, I'd fire them if they worked for me. "
4,av2min,t2_2vulfjbh,PretendPause,"NTA You tipped through the app, that's how it works... I don't know if they can see the tip amount beforehand, if that was the case he should have refused. Almost sounds like he does that to everyone to get more money out of each run. I say you're all good. "
4,ak8g09,t2_io85id2,whippetshuffle,"YTA if you do this and give them no explanation as to what’s going on. You may have good intentions, but intentions pale in comparison to the true impact of your actions. Have a conversation with them. Let them be part of the decision. "
4,aj5hn0,t2_y5tlr,SlicedNugget,"NTA. You gave them an early notice on this. It's not like you just dropped it on them. And this is your education, your *future* we're talking about here. Let them be upset, this is your life your preparing for yourself. Get that education."
4,a6nhnl,t2_cjrd8,chitoryu12,"NTA If he's searching furniture and throwing away edible arrangements out of paranoia, his campaign is doomed. May as well have some fun with it."
4,azbq18,t2_1kyj3rvu,Mystery_Substance,NTA. Although considering the amount of distress she was in it looks like you got a few years payback in one.
4,au04mo,t2_k8tgncq,GoWailord,NTA. You took him to a private location to talk about an issue you had and wanted to work on. Sounds like you did the right thing to me. I don't understand who talks to dogs on balconies
4,au04mo,t2_12rouu,BlurredSight,"INFO, IF you talked outside while others were walking by, or the conversation got loud you are the asshole, if it was a private area and no one else could hear you're NTA he just wanted a way out that's all"
4,aursly,t2_afofc,JackSucks,"NTA The percentage of people that would be suitable for your boyfriend is low and you don’t seem to be in that group if this is such a sticking point for him. It is something than could change, but his current response is irrational. You’re and asshole if you expect him to change and your kinda silly if you stay thinking he will change with no real signs that he will. "
4,ao43q9,t2_2nsuao69,awksauce96,NTA He's been home. He planned it. He should have done the cleaning and shopping since he's known about it for a while. He's being childish.
4,ao43q9,t2_u82k6,queenofthera,"NTA/ESH You shouldn't have forced him to cancel the party, but you were right about everything else. I think the better thing would be to have resigned all responsibility for it; don't clean for him and don't run around buying/serving snacks. Let his own lack of foresight and organisation ruin the party. Let him make his bed and lie in it. "
4,ao43q9,t2_qaaph,TooLateHindsight,"NTA It's both your homes. How the house look when you have visitors is a reflection of you as well as him. You give a shit about your reputation, Shane your husband can't muster that effort."
4,ao43q9,t2_2jnvmzip,StarsLikeLittleFish,"NTA. You're treating him like a child, but he's acting like a child so that seems appropriate. It's reasonable for you to have boundaries about whenever you feel comfortable with people being entertained in your home. And if cleaning was too much of a burden, he should have cancelled the party much earlier."
4,ao43q9,t2_1x2st2w,mutherofdoggos,"NTA. I suspect your husband has larger entitlement issues. He doesn’t work, and he doesn’t take care of the house....how is this man contributing to your family? What does he bring to the table? Is there a medical reason he isn’t able to contribute in any way? If there is no valid reason he can’t, tell him to get a job or start pulling his weight at home. "
4,awlgx1,t2_2kgqaq1a,mr_woodles123,"NTA. If it can be undone like that and you have to live in the room, who gives a shit. making it more grown up would probably increase the resale value anyway. "
4,ayyvrw,t2_2fxpe4l,PhoenixSheriden,"Nta because in a comment OP says the movie was an 8PM showing, and even of it wasn't quite frankly even other kids shouldn't be made to put up with a screecher or a full volume and brightness phone. "
4,aq26dm,t2_31uqrglr,heheok1,"YTA. Your grandma came out of concern for you and waited. She said one remark which you could’ve just ignored or replied something in a neutral manner. Instead you raise your voice at her and snapped which obviously leads to her feeling disrespected, she’s your grandma. Her reaction was a product of YOUR action. Being stressed isn’t an excuse to be disrespectful. "
4,b992hd,t2_36pmnlyi,laalaa-hotshot,"YTA I mean come on, you didn't even give the cat 24h. Obviously you got an animal without having planned for the responsibility. Then you freak out after the first night and return the cat without talking to her first. It sounds irresponsible and immature."
4,ay6qms,t2_36kziul9,killahkaylee,"NTA for wanting that, how you approach it with H though could put you in asshole territory. From my own experience, I had to grin and bare it until the BF did something that made my partner see his true colors on his own. "
4,9ul17j,t2_9a9lhy,timelordoftheimpala,"NTA. You haven't taken any action to throw her or your friend out. Note you you and your friend *share* the apartment, so he should also be considerate of your wants, as you are of his."
4,b0ah2w,t2_ag3gs,Master_Broshi,"NTA I think. I can't follow your spending agreement. You shouldn't re-neg on an agreement. It's also rude to quit your job and say you can't pay anymore, unless she consulted with you and it was a team decision."
4,b0ah2w,t2_x1j6s,TentaclesAndCupcakes,"NTA. Either it should stay the same, 50/50 on everything, or if you are feeling generous you can swap - she does bills and you do rent. Any of those options seem like they would be in the realm of fair."
4,azmdy1,t2_3brv9wf6,averagepersonprobs,"NTA. From what I understand from it, they could have bought those seats, couldn't they? If they didn't, and the theater agreed to sell them to you, you're entitled to them. Edit: typo"
4,azmdy1,t2_zm4j6,kashikoicat,"YTA What I don't under is why, if they were clearly in the theater before you, didn't they buy the handicapped seats? Unless you bought the tickets and then spent a bunch of time in the bathroom or something. Regardless, you shouldn't plan to get those seats unless you need it."
4,b05ub0,t2_1amt71c9,TheDukuTree,"NTA, if the guy was leaving his water and towel and left for 20 mins that means he is hogging the machine which is a real dick thing. He isnt following gym etiquette, you're good man"
4,b05ub0,t2_2em5b6id,Vigilant1e,NTA. Gym etiquette is not reserving a machine if you aren't actively on it. You can't just fuck off to some other machine for 20 minutes and expect everyone to steer clear of your 'reserved' one.
4,b05ub0,t2_afofc,JackSucks,"NTA You don’t have to ask around to see if someone is on the machine. If the gym is crowded, you should be able to tell if someone is using a machine or not, they should either be using it, in between sets, or cleaning it for the next person. "
4,b05ub0,t2_15uvzb,usa_foot_print,NTA. If someone is gone for 1 minute the machine is up for grabs. Sorry not sorry. I have been gyming for years and always lived by this. I used to live by the idea that people took their weights off when they were done but that rarely happens.
4,acelug,t2_yeae0,dollars-and-sense,YTA . The guy was fired... Police were brought in. Sounds like the musician did the right thing. What the heck is the point of drawing this kind of negative attention to the musician who by all accounts appears to have done the right thing? What purpose is it serving other than bringing attention to yourself?
4,b4ut3x,t2_2i4z3fbc,4minute-Tyri,"NTA. > I potentially ruined her life Great stuff. > I've destroyed all of her trust in men. This is kinda a general statement for anyone that has some widespread distrust of the opposite gender, but that is entirely on them. "
4,b2fyif,t2_38ykb7b1,PM-me-ur-kittenz,"YTA. Interesting, this exact same question was asked last week when the person was at a ""regular"" restaurant and everybody went apeshit about how the person who came and asked to share was SUCH an asshole, but in an airport restaurant suddenly everything's different. Me, I'm in Germany, not sharing a table makes you TA no matter where you are, since your 2-top is in no way entitled to take up a 4-tops worth of real estate."
4,b04cn9,t2_2lftd2is,G8RTOAD, NTA Wow of your parents and sister are all acting like yta in a hypothetical situation if and when you do get engaged it would probably be safer and easier to just elope. 
4,b04cn9,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"NTA Your entire family...is insane. All of them. Your wedding, your choice. And with her behavior, and her attention getting attitude, you would never want her as a bridesmaid or maid of honor."
4,b04cn9,t2_zucag,woolfonmynoggin,"NTA but for future reference, I wouldn't get into hypothetical conversations like this. It's probably better for you to smile and nod and say non-committal things like ""maybe someday"" or ""we'll cross that bridge when we come to it"". You shouldn't have to do this with family, but that would be in a perfect world. "
4,a85sa1,t2_1u53w365,peepopsicle,NTA. It sucks that you have to distance yourself from someone who is struggling and could probably use a friend but she brought this upon herself by treating you poorly. She doesn't get a free pass to treat you like shit just because she has depression.
4,a37od2,t2_tkgkv79,illy7681,"YTA. A study group is not the same as composing/recording music on electric instruments. Your best option might be to try and schedule something with him, but otherwise you need to use headphones or a music room. There's no perfect solution because you and he have directly competing interests. You're going to have to get your own place/a music room or compromise. &#x200B; You're extra assholey for arguing so much in the comments, but I'll give you a pass on that for the purposes of judging."
4,avrhoh,t2_daloo,FSUalumni,"Yta. If you have a problem with always paying, discuss it. Passive aggressively dealing with this when you haven't indicated that you have a problem with it before is immature. And it's a little ESH because she's never offered to pay, but the social norms as to the guy paying still exist for some. Absent a discussion and given your apparent willingness to pay, she's not quite to ESH level imo"
4,b5nh55,t2_82d1i,trailrider,"Absolutely NTA but your neighbor sure as hell is. I would be PISSED if someone did that to me and would've explained in NO uncertain terms that if they fucked with the machines again, she is NOT getting any sleep that night. Your neighbor has absolutely no right to do what she did. Especially since there's no signs. ""Unwritten"" rules are just that. Unwritten. "
4,b5nh55,t2_qfv30,Chrysoptera,NTA. Night shifters need to do laundry too. There was nothing to indicate that the laundry room was closed or that the noise would be excessive. It was rude for your neighbor to interrupt your laundry twice and throw your clean clothes on the floor. 
4,b7tqsb,t2_wt9h5,sgtabn173,"NTA. It was his mistake, and he should not *expect* you to cover any of it. While I would personally be more willing to help him correct his mistake, I find it hard to fault you at all for being willing to pay half. "
4,aut8ff,t2_35i5ddcv,butactuallywhytho,"NTA, also, she’s not your wife anymore unfortunately. Have you considered why she gets to take time and pay zero bills and you have to carry her and pay everything.. even though youre getting divorced? It’s time to file for a divorce yourself"
4,azmghr,t2_2tm2gxjx,Ann-von-Beaverhausen,NTA. Years ago I was a server and I would have been happy with a larger tip if you left a mess. Lots of people unapologetically leave a huge mess and only tip like 12%. 
4,azmghr,t2_3cqpeyx6,anxiousperson4ever,"NTA. As a server myself, your extra $15 was appreciated. You are automatically not the asshole because you recognized your family made a mess. You would be surprised at how many people make a big mess, leave a few crumbled dollars underneath the mess and carry on. You are a great person! "
4,azmghr,t2_eqw0p,Thelonius16,NTA. I have to remind myself to leave a normal 20% when my wife and I go out by ourselves. I'm so used to leaving apology money.
4,azmghr,t2_1ftqfk8q,kimber_wren,NTA. Messes happen and you were thoughtful enough to leave extra. At least my friends who have been servers would generally be fine with that.
4,azmghr,t2_iw41h57,SplendidPotato,"NTA - having worked as a server for many years, we’re payed almost nothing by the hour and live off of tips. Many people leave the table a mess and still tip nothing lol. I’d love to be the person who served you - an extra task for me to do at work and a good tip. You pay for work and for service."
4,azmghr,t2_34xrw9tw,mymushys3,NTA- I was a server for years and I would of been thrilled and would of cleaned up with a smile 
4,b9i0nm,t2_jlyhxix,Justwantetizbro,NTA. For better or for worse I have made a decision my entire adult life to never talk to ex's no matter what happens. I see friends and family get emotionally looped back in with people who do nothing but use them and I refuse to do the same. Also shes a cheater so definitely NTA for that reason alone. 
4,ba5ad6,t2_rl948rg,welp-thereitis,NTA. You were willing to let it pass if he weren't being an asshole about it. He could have also went to a line dedicated to the elderly. It's possible he's been an entitled asshole for about 90 years. 
4,ba5ad6,t2_144909,PattyLeeTX,"Actually, the inhibition part of the “thinking brain” is often the first to go. We tend to think that “they’re old and just don’t care” when they start belching and farting in public, sighing heavily, and yes, getting into altercations. So you’re technically NTA, but I thought this information might help you to dismiss what may seem rude transgressions. "
4,ba5ad6,t2_b131f5z,Boo155,"NTA. Just because you're old doesn't mean you're nice. If by working his ass off to give you your rights, he meant that he served in WWII, then he had a bit of a point, but that still doesn't excuse his behavior. I wonder, though, if he has a bit of dementia, and maybe was so quick to anger because of that."
4,ba5ad6,t2_g2hg7,Allimack,"YTA Because sometimes you've got to just give people the benefit of the doubt. If he's actually 90, his health or eyesight may be poor. He also may have some dementia and not be fully aware of the social cues he missed seeing. If he only had a few things, it would have been kinder to just let him cut in."
4,a74x5y,t2_2lgd8839,AWholeGlareOfCats,"NTA - he’s said before that he enjoys giving head, so for him to stop now seems like a punishment imo. You should definitely talk it out with him though. Open honest communication is hard but necessary. "
4,a90n6c,t2_2hpp19wh,esscuchi,"NTA You're an adult now. You passwords, personal belongings, and online accounts are all your own. Your parents may be worried for your well-being, but that doesn't mean they get to access anything and everything in your life. They need to find a less intrusive way to manage their own concerns."
4,b4i9ik,t2_2kqzj3jn,feedbacksandwich,"NTA. Absolutely not. Responsible dog ownership is a thing. Specially if you go through a polite process. The owners might not know about the barking, if they are out while it happens. If they are home they are aware and need to deal with it."
4,azczc2,t2_2bswm839,Skullbearer55,"Ehhh, a very mild YTA. You didn't mean it in a racist way but it could really really easily be misunderstood as racist. Generally avoid those kind of remarks unless you know the people you're with really well."
4,a8cvvc,t2_272x9u1p,gaychella,"NTA - it's your house too. I agree you should have phrased that better but he should be understanding that you were upset, tired, and caught off guard. He's the asshole for not valuing your needs when you brought them up. "
4,a8cvvc,t2_zq8bs,thinkevolution,"NTA - it's basic consideration really. I'd rather my husband tell me if he's making plans or even a text on the way ""hey Think - my bro stopped by unexpectedly - just wanted to give you the heads up."" Maybe he can do something like that to prep you if this happens again?"
4,ar2f6b,t2_2ps0sgor,Celistar99,"Omg, NTA. I get this completely. When I was growing up my family did this and it drove me insane. I ordered what I wanted because THAT'S WHAT I WANTED. I don't want a bite of your whatever. Especially considering you've mentioned it to her before, she needs to stop. It honestly gave me a complex as an adult and made me protective of my food. "
4,ar2f6b,t2_1to0qqa2,MikkiTh,"NTA Tell her this stops now. She can either keep her fork out of your plate or the two of you can stop going out to eat together. Your reasons for this boundary don't matter, she's refusing to respect it and that's a problem. "
4,ar2f6b,t2_1q2nya00,frumpyfrog,"NTA. This is completely inconsiderate. When my husband and I go out for a meal, we might TASTE what the other is eating, but only a bite or two. Next time, order yourself 2 plates of food. Let her know in advance so it doesn't cause another fight (I think it would come off as passive-agressive otherwise). If she decides not to ""sample"", you'll have leftovers, so win-win!"
4,ar2f6b,t2_2rjh9i6c,nothingspecial247,"NTA. I grew up in a ""sharing food"" family, and we still had boundaries. The person who ordered the item would either put a small amount on your plate (to try) or a larger amount on a bread plate (if they had more they were willing to share). Point being, the person who ordered was in complete control of their own plate and of how much they were willing to part with. I think seeing the portion makes people treat it differently, too."
4,ar2f6b,t2_100fbf,Thriftyverse,NTA This is boundary-stomping crap. You've explained multiple times that you don't like when she does it and she still does it. It shows a lack of respect and a lack of caring.
4,ar2f6b,t2_2ypd1me8,anything_always,"NTA I generally order what I think will satisfy me and I imagine most people do when they look at the menu. If you have someone eating half your food, you start going through a mental tug of war, do I need to order more food, will I be hungry later, is this too much if I order more? I hate wasting food or feeling like I over ate."
4,ar2f6b,t2_1102k2,PM_ME_UR_NETFLIX_REC,"NTA Respecting boundaries is important, regardless as to how trivial they seem to the other person. Her willfully making you uncomfortable for her delight is not a healthy interaction. It is only playful when both people are playing. If one person is not consenting to the play, it is disrespectful. In the abstract, eating some of your food is not a terrible injury. Consistently disrespecting your wishes, however, is."
4,ar2f6b,t2_dzkjp03,Pixamel,NTA Boundary-pushing people like this get on my nerves. You're a saint for suffering with this for so long. I suggest a therapist to see if there's an underlying reason for this behaviour. 
4,ar2f6b,t2_1363b5,LuckyFishBone,"NTA. I can't even imagine someone eating off my plate at all, not even one bite. I've never encountered this in my life, thankfully, but it's gross. She needs to realize this is disgusting behavior and cut it out."
4,ar2f6b,t2_dsh0e9v,Floweringpooops,NTA and you shouldn't stay married to someone who has no respect for your or your boundaries and likes to manipulate situations to play the victim
4,ak7ucj,t2_t5rxj,cookestudios,NTA at all. Your parents are refusing to respect your boundaries and your father wants you to enable him instead of respecting your attempts to find him legitimate help. You're 27. Live your life.
4,ak7ucj,t2_own8t,fartenandmagellan,"NTA. There may be years when your parents really do need to rely on your frequent care and assistance... but they're not there yet, so you should relish your independence and enjoy your life some! Take the further-away apartment."
4,abve1t,t2_15nc0n,Silrhyn,"NTA The nerve of some people ! When you ask someone to vouch for you, you make sure to behave, and certainly don’t complain if the host kicks you out because of your behavior. I would be so mortified and apologetic if I was in their place. "
4,azxkx5,t2_2oak1g11,Quinnalicious21,"NTA your not obligated to be with anyone. Wtf kind of legal action can she take for getting rejected, But you should get your parents off your back and not use that as an excuse "
4,9tn5is,t2_1ir2y1at,Dusty1000287,"NTA in my opinion, A) you didn't ask for the divorce, she did. B) she hasn't paid a penny towards the mortgage of the house and C) your looking after the kids so she has no real hardships other then having to live with her grandparents which can't be that bad. "
4,b4g0ho,t2_28g1tclh,BabySealOfDoom,"NTA good on you for caring enough to speak up against an abuser. I'm sorry this turned out to have negative immediate consequences, but no one can know what will become of the situation."
4,ajjhws,t2_l18vc,YawnP,"YTA If they are delivering food they are probably already either getting free food or discounted food from the location they are working at. Additionally, even if you use a debit card there is most likely a way to add the tip. You are basically taking the tip money and using it to buy something they can get themselves if they wanted to. "
4,ajjhws,t2_216gmwf5,bmolsen86,YTA. A tip line has been on receipts for ages regardless of how you order. I’m really quite baffled how you’ve never noticed. Also they are probably sick of the food they deliver and definitely don’t want to eat. I’m sorry but that’s so clueless. 
4,ajjhws,t2_amcm0,squary93,"NTA Good sentiment but they don't need your food. From my experience, these guys get enough leftovers for themselves everyday. At least they did where I used to work at. So don't tip food. It's pointless. "
4,b2msfn,t2_5dqsu,SockofBadKarma,"NTA If I'm reading this correctly, ""current GPU"" is synonymous with ""older GPU"". You gave him permission to use the old one. However, he used the new one. He did not have permission to use the new one, which means he's committed petty larceny by taking it without your permission. Had you tried to repo your old one after saying he could have it, you would have been the asshole for taking back a gift without warning, but he never even had the go-ahead to use the new one, nor did he ask you if he could. He's now punishing you by rescinding a prior allowance (to use his computer) for having taken your property back and calling him out on committing a felony. If he wants to use the new GPU, he should ask instead of stealing it. Collecting that stolen property is not an asshole move imo."
4,aid4oy,t2_2dgkgidu,tradefundtrade,"NTA. You have a lot to lose and nothing to gain. You should speak with Olivia. From what I read, it sounds like Olivia was aware that you know of her health situation. I would tell her that you expect Jack to be informed. You and your friends have a lot of drama. "
4,b4ejwe,t2_xv636,ex-inteller,"NTA. Constant groping is not desirable. On the other hand, a 33 year old dude with a 20 year old is only interested in one thing, and he’s pretty clearly telling you that."
4,b4ejwe,t2_38ykb7b1,PM-me-ur-kittenz,NTA I had one of those BFs and it was exhausting. You have every right not to be groped in your own home. Or anywhere else. Be prepared for him to get super whiny and shitty when you try and enforce some boundaries; you may have to break up with him over this.
4,b4ejwe,t2_18cxei2,ImMr_Bulldops,"NTA. This is pretty concerning behavior from your boyfriend. You are never an asshole for standing up for your body. If you don't want to be touched, no one has the right to touch you, and not your boyfriend. Since you have told him to stop, and he hasn't, that is an issue where he isn't respecting your boundaries and that is not your fault. It is \*your\* body. Also, I don't want to judge and other people may have said this but that is slightly more concerning when coupled with the age difference."
4,b4ejwe,t2_yz94t,EarlGreyhair,"NTA. You have a right to assert your own bodily autonomy. And you shouldn’t give the time of day to anyone who keeps crossing physical boundaries. >I've told him times where I don't want to do that and push his hand away, and he respects that. But he keeps doing it. If he keeps doing it, then he doesn’t really respect it, does he? "
4,b4ejwe,t2_24t54bze,daxnotgood30,NTA: NO one had the right to touch you if you don’t want it. Arguably this is sexual assault so you could even point that out to him and it might be a bigger wake up call.
4,as5ww0,t2_48kjz,Teshi,"NTA. I think you're on the right track, but your brother clearly wants to spend time with you. However, you're right that it may be time to take a break from ""playing"" with your brother in any way that pits the two of you against each other. Are there games that are *collaborative*? Can you maybe go to the movies once a month? Not cutting off time completely, but changing the time you spend together. "
4,ap8iru,t2_7l8z2wo,CapHelmet,"NTA and wtf is wrong with this woman? h Honestly letting her get away with this time after time only enables her behavoir, I'd give it a 2nd thought on not pressing charges mate"
4,ap8iru,t2_231p3p6b,sfle05,NTA. That was outright stealing and it isn't even the first thing something like it has happened. You mom is supposed to be someone you can rely on and she blatantly violated your trust. I can't see how anyone would blame you for distancing yourself from her. You already did her a favor by not taking legal action.
4,azxay6,t2_11shpvv7,mrteacherman24,"NTA. There might be some things we're missing here, but if it's as straightforward as it looks, go find someone who will understand and support your interests. "
4,azxay6,t2_9cdmh,captainstormy,"NTA, Pretty much any time a woman in life says ""it's me or something else"" the right choice is almost always the other thing. That is nothing but emotional blackmail from a control freak."
4,ahio30,t2_16k1v8,NMPire,"NTA because your view is essentially that you would be a bad parent. So it's obviously better that you don't have any kids. The issue would be if you hated kids, as in any kid you see you immediately dislike and resent them purely for being a kid. That would make you ""YTA"""
4,ahio30,t2_1m0abdfm,LivingAtAltitude,NTA There's no rule that you need to be a parent. In fact I think it's commendable that you realize that it's not the path for you. Too many people have kids and SUCK at parenting.
4,ag8qzp,t2_wh2sxd1,Alchemyst19,"NTA. You didn't break it intentionally, and the accident occurred while you were acting in self-defense. BIL shouldn't be putting valuable company equipment in risky situations like that."
4,ag8qzp,t2_8nr4k,syntaxxor,NTA - Anyone with a brain or twitch account knows that shit can happen while wearing a VR setup; especially if the person wearing it is frightened at all. It wasn't intentional and he honestly should not have been toying with company property if he wasn't ready to pony up the cost of it. &#x200B; Sidenote: Your wife. WTF is that about? Laughing about an experience you shared with her? She's the biggest asshole there.
4,ag8qzp,t2_d6fvsf8,EmpiricalAnarchism,"NTA. In a straightforward sense, the chance that the victim panics and breaks the system is inherit in the risk of playing that type of prank on someone. Your brother in law assumed that risk when playing the prank on you. He's the asshole. But your wife is a much, much bigger problem, and I think her actions have revealed that you should not remain married to her."
4,ag8qzp,t2_1549ex,SgtWicket1,NTA. Accidents happen and this one is on them. Sounds like they are not trying to see your perspective. If this thing is so important to him and his job maybe he shouldn’t be using it to pull pranks. 
4,ag8qzp,t2_gz1ey,OnionOfShame,"NTA. He shouldn't have fucked around with his expensive prototype equipment, and it's his fault it's broken. And I hate to be that guy but if that's how you wife reacted I would seriously reconsider that relationship."
4,ag8qzp,t2_1f3zkgng,n_m_l,NTA- their worried about a piece of equipment when this so called joke could have detrimental consequences on ur mental health and well being?! Ur wife is a total bitch for allowing it in the first place!! Ur BIL is no better for not showing remorse or sympathy once it was explained to him
4,ag8qzp,t2_lxyc47z,Bumpanalog,NTA. I genuinely feel bad for you that your wife views your trauma like that. I can't imagine my fiancee ever reacting like that to sharing a vulnerable ordeal from my past with her.
4,ag8qzp,t2_otksf,Alexandrite_Dragon,"NTA, and don't pay anyone anything, not one cent. You and your wife need to see a marriage councilor like, yesterday, if that's legit how she responds to your emotional trauma triggering."
4,ag8qzp,t2_6yuaf,Viperbunny,"NTA! Your wife knew your history and that makes it worse. It is bad enough to want to humiliate someone you love, but, she went beyond that. I wouldn't pay for it. I would also recommend couple's therapy. She has a lot to learn."
4,ag8qzp,t2_swrrc,blackmobius,NTA and If your wife continues to insist your obvious issues with her brothers actions are somehow your fault then you might also need to have a good look at your marriage. Dont pay a cent and make sure your wife doesnt either
4,ag8qzp,t2_eml7w,AStudyinViolet,"NTA. I was going to say no assholes here because your BIL evidently doesn’t know your history, but I really don’t get the lack of empathy, especially from your wife, when you revealed the source of your reaction. Obviously what you did was an accident."
4,ag8qzp,t2_6er19fg,Smoke-and-Stroke_Jr,"NTA. He irresponsibly put the equipment in danger himself by doing that. It's on him. If you want to be nice and help with the cost, that's up to you. But after how they acted, I wouldn't. "
4,ag8qzp,t2_1q8u37y8,RedWestern,"NTA First, your trauma is nothing to laugh at, especially if at least one of them knew about it. And they themselves admit that they were trying to prank you. If you break something in a moment of fear as a result of a cruel prank, the pranksters are responsible for it. Don’t pay for it. Instead, tell your BIL that if he wants the money from you, he can go to court and explain it to a judge. See if that will fucking fly."
4,ag8qzp,t2_mkgv55h,sapphicpenguin,"NTA. Your BIL is in charge of any company property he takes home. Anything that happens to it is his responsibility. If you'd done it on purpose, that would be one thing. But it was entirely an accident (not to mention born out of a triggering situation). If you wanted to pay for part of the damages to keep the peace, that would be reasonable. But I don't think you should have to pay a cent."
4,ag8qzp,t2_dii8k,ElectricFleshlight,"NTA, you didn't mean to break it. But the right thing to do is pay for at least part of the damage, even though it was an accident. Maybe offer to go 50/50, your BIL is also responsible for screwing around with property that wasn't even his. "
4,ag8qzp,t2_1x2st2w,mutherofdoggos,"NTA. They played a shitty game. They won a shitty prize. Although this is almost more on your wife than your BIL. She knew about your past trauma and she \*should\* have known that kinda joke would be traumatic for you. I do think your BIL is shit out of luck here, but if anyone should be paying for that system, it's your wife. "
4,ag8qzp,t2_1vpexz7b,Simply_a_nerd,"NTA, the joke was fucked and your other half shod have told him not to do shit like that. Also, not to mention that they still gave zero shits the you already had post-trama from being molested in the past. In short, they're at fault here not you."
4,ag8qzp,t2_2u6v509d,janejanexoxo,"NTA, obviously this was a very hard situation for you and your wife probably should have known better. However... This will most likely be an unpopular opinion. You should pay for the VR headset. Even if your break something on accident you are still the person who broke it. Therefore I believe you are responsible to repair it. Your brother didn’t know how you were gonna react, and it’s not his fault that you broke it imo. "
4,ag8qzp,t2_14f3mg,amusedpandas,"NTA, and your wife should've known better. They have sick senses of humor and should apologize instead of trying to tell you how you should feel and make you feel guilty for being traumatized ffs"
4,ag8qzp,t2_10jany,rabidbadger6,NTA - you didn’t break it on purpose and your panicked reaction was more than understandable. That sort of “prank” is more abuse than a joke and they should have known better than to do that. I’m sorry this has happened to you.
4,ag8qzp,t2_1rlqmeir,a1337sti,"nta, yes you are legally liable for damages to someone else's property, though if he sued you, you could counter sue for emotional distress and who knows.. &#x200B; Morally i say you get a pass on having to pay. (which has no weight what so ever...) "
4,ag8qzp,t2_rg7y7,ICUMTARANTULAS,"NTA, your BIL is NTA, but your wife TA, he didn’t know you had a molestation issue. However getting scared is no reason to break it. If it was just like a VR horror game and you got it broken from it would you still feel like it wasn’t your responsibility? Naw dog. Most fair thing in this should be you give him half of what the cost of the VR was, if he gets fired l, the whole thing."
4,ao9swn,t2_1pu4h4zm,bobtheorangecat,"NTA. As an adoptee with bio-siblings, I can completely understand finding one's biological family taxing, to say the least. Sometimes we're just not up to dealing with the issues of people whose only connection to us is DNA."
4,ap4n0r,t2_ctpid,icesurfer10,"NTA: I think it's reasonable not to want the kids around, however... If they have children and both join you for drinks, you are potentially cutting off your invite if they don't have somebody that can look after the children. You can't just ignore small children!"
4,apc2b5,t2_wlfu5,Belomil,"NTA. You told her to stop it multiple times and she doesn't understand that yours is not hers. I'd personally go for laxatives, but that maaaaay be slightly illegal. Maybe just a note on the fridge that says something like ""5 things in this fridge have been mixed with laxatives. You have been warned."""
4,apc2b5,t2_1yrtk0uu,amireallyathrowaway,"NTA. She's been warned multiple times and refuses to change her behavior, and your brother refuses to help with it, so you're fine. If weight's such an issue for her, she should consider eating less, or improving her diet, or doing something about it. The fact that she has, apparently, done none of those things, and refuses to listen to you guys means she deserves some sort of punishment for it, and in this case, the punishment fit the crime."
4,apc2b5,t2_dv8k2,b3n020295,"NTA - wondering if it would have been possible to kick them both out if it didn’t stop/she didn’t get help, unless the brother was part of the lease/contract? Clearly her eating disorder/greed needs to be addressed in a house meeting of sorts."
4,apc2b5,t2_16bm1u,Leifang666,"NTA usually I'd say what you were calling her was disgusting, but you'd politely told her multiple times not to eat your food. Would not be an issue calling a thin girl piggy for stealing food, so her weight isn't in the equation. "
4,apc2b5,t2_1ad1nnyr,naegoodinthedark,"NTA - You asked politely, asked the boyfriend to get involved basically offered every opportunity for her to stop. Food isn't free, if her crying is the consequence of her ignorance and bad manners maybe it will be a lesson learned for her "
4,apc2b5,t2_5trm8,drhagbard_celine,"When you're overweight and sensitive about it, drawing attention to that by repeatedly stealing food isn't the wisest way to avoid negative attention. I know that you know this wasn't an example of your taking the high road, but I wouldn't go so far as to say YTA. Your brother's girlfriend definitely is, and your brother to a slightly lesser extent because he's your brother, your roommate, and takes no action to stop her behavior. On the list of assholes you're down far enough to not even mention. "
4,apc2b5,t2_ycfq3,unabowler,NTA. You had a habitual thief in your midst and less extreme methods hadn't effectively rid you of her. 
4,apc2b5,t2_2gtkjui4,liptonthrowback,NTA. I'm fat and I'm sensitive about it and if I repeatedly ate food belonging to other people after they asked me nicely to stop I would consider those comments well deserved. And now she won't come over? Mission accomplished.
4,apc2b5,t2_11lsxz,Haeenki,NTA. I mean your reactions weren't always as delicate as they could have been but after it going on for so long I find it fully understandable and it sound like your brother needs to grow a pair.
4,apc2b5,t2_2wssiz6x,aweepee,"NTA because I don’t really blame you, although I think handling it differently would show more maturity on your part. Some ideas might be: installing a lock on a cupboard, getting a mini fridge to lock in your room, asking her to contribute to food costs and making extra for her, putting out cheap decoy food (plain rice, maybe?) that she can eat instead."
4,apc2b5,t2_1009nvqo,Calismax,"NTA- Shes a thief and out right disrespects your constant request not to eat YOUR food. Body shaming to be mean is bad, but if you asked nicely and got ignored you do have to escalate things to get your point across. Method maybe bad but you cant argue with the results."
4,apc2b5,t2_acmcq,Amonette2012,"Anyone who eats your dinner is an asshole. That's not just stealing food, it's stealing time. She's being intentionally disrespectful in your home and nothing else you have tried has worked. Sure, it would be mean under some circumstances, but not in this case. NTA. "
4,apc2b5,t2_31mkh4dt,NeatNefariousness1,"ESH and yes YTA but, you were justified and may have found the one thing to make it stop since your brother refuses to handle this situation. The only other thing I can think of to address this would be to put a lock on the refrigerator (how does one even do this?). Your brother would have to get his own refrigerator. This is what he gets since he can't seem to keep his girlfriend from stealing everyone's food. If he doesn't like it, he should control the situation or move out."
4,apc2b5,t2_thrhb,Sahris,Nta I know calling someone a pig is rude but in this case she earned it by repeatedly stealing food with no justification or excuse even. 
4,apc2b5,t2_ndtcxhg,bloodyjokr,"NTA - decisions have consequences, and she decided her own fate by continue to do it, hope she learns from it "
4,apc2b5,t2_15b68d,dragonsfire242,"I would say NTA, with a small sprinkling of ESH, it is a really mean name, but as said before, food ain't free, she wants to eat she should buy food herself, if it isn't yours, it isn't yours"
4,apc2b5,t2_fw732,CleanWholesomePhun,"NTA - she's been stealing from you with impunity, you've asked her not to, and she laughs and continues stealing. Instead of poisoning or physically harming her, you stayed non-violent and used your words to resolve the situation. Seems like Miss Piggy is done stealing from you."
4,apc2b5,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"NTA She's eating your food. Food you paid for. You've confronted her multiple times. At this point I'd have put laxatives in the food. Your names are mean, but she's an inconsiderate thief."
4,apc2b5,t2_48f0e,postulio,NTA i would've been way way meaner after all civil requests were ignored. At this point just be mean enough to ostracize her
4,apc2b5,t2_exv51,crew6dawg0,"NTA. She is extremely disrespectful and does not respect your personal property. Yes, for those who are too thick to wake up, food is personal property if you paid for it. She deserves it, keep it up."

4,apc2b5,t2_sul37,-Shanannigan-,"NTA You tried being polite, you tried coming to compromises. Nothing worked. I think that after she repeatedly ignored and disrespected the boundaries you had set that the gloves come off. Open mockery and shaming of her behavior is fine at that point."
4,apc2b5,t2_1d5af94a,PupuleJess,"NTA, I would say if you immediately resorted to commenting on her weight you would suck but...... this has been an issue for awhile. You tried talking to your brother who is responsible for his guests and nothing. You then tried talking to her with no luck. She either needs to be banned from your house or you need that second fridge. Try to refrain from future name calling. Be the bigger person here, it's a bit juvenile."
4,apc2b5,t2_2ulq61r2,iron-raven,"NTA, mostly. I mean, the name calling and oink noises were a bit mean, but I can imagine being so frustrated that it just kind of slipped out. And she and your brother are definitely assholes in this situation. "
4,apc2b5,t2_2db3v4jl,iphonerepairgrill,NTA. She sounds like a pig. Miss Piggy is fitting. She no longer wants to come over. Mission accomplished. Tell your brother to stick his dick in to some other porker if he really has a problem with it.
4,apc2b5,t2_2dt9xldb,imostlytakeLs,"I’m going to have to say YTA in this situation... I completely understand your frustration and something should be done about her eating your guys food.

4,apc2b5,t2_2pzfy01d,Rachel_Nichols_ESPN,"Nta fuck her. You worked for that food, you earned it, not her. She is stealing. Food is essential for human survival, so she is essentially robbing you of a proper sustainability for the lives of you and your roommate."

4,apc2b5,t2_929px,Jaywearspants,NTA. I don't think crossing the line into that level of mean is uncalled for when you've asked nicely several times. Hurting someone's feelings is a decent price to pay for theft IMHO. 
4,apc2b5,t2_nd8aa,Rizenstrom,"NTA, they're abusing your hospitality and you've already tried (repeatedly) to be reasonable and talk it out. You're not doing this unprovoked and you could totally kick them out if you so chose. Honestly, maybe you should. Or at least threaten it, if you haven't already. The thought of being homeless would probably be more effective than just making fun of her, otherwise she's probably going to assume she can keep doing it with no repercussions."
4,apc2b5,t2_2mxp0kx3,agatha-burnett,"NTA, i would have made her cry so bad who would have lost weight because of the effort. She’s a disrespectful cunt and needs to be dealt with accordingly. I for one have no patience for reapeating myself. "

4,apc2b5,t2_1svwmfrq,Lazaryx,NTA. Well done. She chose to eat your food despite you telling her multiple times not to. After the first couple times you called her like this she should have taken the hint. 
4,apc2b5,t2_2xur1dxh,Fitbarbie1,"NTA, when I lived with roommates the fattest girl kept eating my food. I started labeling all my food with my name on it and she still had the nerve to eat it! I was working 2 jobs at that time and needed to save money. "
4,apc2b5,t2_n83zu,AdmiralToucan,"NTA Food isn't free and stealing is a crime. She wouldn't get away with doing this at a convenient store or restaurant!

4,a4jen0,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"NTA. You know she's bad with money, and she's a little unstable. This is the final straw. Take the card. Give her a gift card that reloads.

4,b3rseb,t2_35b6ghn3,trekmystars,YTA. You are denying your daughter necessary medical procedure because you can’t accept that a doctor knows more than you. You should pay because you are the own who is insisting on a second opinion for a super common thing. 
4,b3rseb,t2_nda1u3j,chi_lawyer,"INFO, probably YTA. Assuming the kid is insured, is the insurance covering the surgery (subject to usual copays/deductibles, etc.)? If so, you can be confident that there is sufficient medical necessity for the surgery -- they aren't going to pay for a procedure that is really being done for cosmetic purposes and would not be justified otherwise. If insurance is classifying as cosmetic / not medically necessary, probably NTA."
4,b3rseb,t2_4ii51u,Bomberman_N64,YTA. Mainly because of your attitude towards it and your unwillingness to pay for a second opinion. At this point its just a deviated septum and you are looking for a second opinion to avoid surgery. If another doctor says it isn't necessary then she will be forced to say it is just cosmetic. But right now you are just assuming that everyone is lying and basing not paying and all your responses on that.

I don't know whether there are leash laws where you live, but even if there aren't, you should never have your dog off leash unless you have such perfect control over him that you can (and not just can, but actually do!) keep him at your side and away from other people and dogs regardless of all distractions. "
4,a65rr1,t2_xs0m8ih,qu33fwellington,"YTA. there’s a reason for leash laws. It doesn’t matter how well behaved or loving your dog is, *strangers have no way of knowing that*. Beyond that, you’re putting your dog’s life on the line. Something could happen and honestly, in most cases involving injuries and dogs, the dog will end up paying for it. So don’t be an asshole. Leash your dog like everyone else. If you want to let him roam around, find an off leash dog park in your area and let him have his fun there. "
4,a65rr1,t2_d2ho6kp,Fixmy59bug,"YTA. &#x200B; Sorry, but most states have a leash law. That is to protect the people as well as the dog. If a dog comes up to my kid and I do not know the dog, I will keep the dog away because I do not know its demeanor or intentions. Both of which can switch in an instant. The dog can go from smelling a hand to trying to rip an arm off in an instant. &#x200B; Obey the law and keep your dog on a leash.

4,a65rr1,t2_10sewh,1738_bestgirl,"YTA obviously. I don't know of a single city where it isn't a finable offense to walk your dog off leash. The random person doesn't know your dog they have no way of knowing if it's friendly. ""He never bites"" is also what every dog owner whose dog bites someone says. Put your dog on a leash dipshit."
4,a65rr1,t2_1tpxtwap,Piemandinoman,"YTA Don't give your dog freedom in public. Even the BEST trained military/Police dogs have had incidents where they attacked the wrong person, and dogs can be vicious. Additionally, if your dog approaches someone who has a deathly fear of dogs, you could find yourself in legal trouble. LEASH YOU DOG, even if its a super long leash."
4,a65rr1,t2_11w7f4,Briezeus,"YTA. Give your dog freedom at a dog park or on private property. Yeah, this guy probably shouldn't have hit your dog, but he wouldn't have been able to if you were acting more respectfully of others in a public space by keeping your dog under better control. "
4,a65rr1,t2_go7ng,GraMacTical0,"Omg you're one of those people who needs the the extra attention that comes from having a well-behaved dog off leash. We're all super impressed! Of course YTA.

4,a65rr1,t2_1cdotn5q,Santadid911,YTA unless you’re in a dog park or only on your property you should leash your dog. I have 2 dogs myself that I would rather not leash. They’re friendly too but things happen and some ppl are really scared of dogs. 
4,a65rr1,t2_p51lsp7,customerservicevoice,"YTA. It's with great regret I say YTA. Dog lover here. Leashes (unless in off leash areas) are just 100% necessary in public spaces. It's just considerate and safe. I know your pup probably enjoys it, but she share the space with everyone else and not everyone loves dogs. However, he HIT Milo so ESH."
4,a65rr1,t2_hggnf,ThePenultimateOne,"YTA. Your dog is off leash in a populated area. Lots of people have allergies, or rather serious phobias. Plus, you cant distinguish easily between a friendly dog and a mean dog on first sight.

I'm concerned that he's not respecting your wishes; when you asked him to return your equipment because you were done, he dismissed you and insisted you continue to do something you don't want to do.

That being said, I know how difficult transitioning to vegan cooking can be, but there are a lot of resources available. Vegan foods can be very kid and budget friendly. I don't want to lecture you, but adopting a vegan diet is a contribution to the wellbeing of our planet and the welfare of animals. Also, check out r/veganrecipes if you want some tips.

4,ati7b2,t2_2994qe1h,NeroPrizak,NTA. How can he expect the whole household to adopt his new eating habits? Or expect you to make a separate vegan meal every night? Neither of those options are reasonable. If he wants to do a super limiting diet then he can also take the steps to implementing it.

4,ati7b2,t2_2xjzy5,Otherwise_Window,"NTA. You're not blindly supporting the meat industry, you've been supplying him with vegetarian food. Veganism is *work*. Especially if he wants to stay healthy.

4,ati7b2,t2_38gqtcp1,bambam320,NTA. It's not your responsibility to see the world the way he does because he changed his mind. He can prepare his own vegan meals. This could be the start of him pushing vegan meals on you and the rest of your family.
4,ati7b2,t2_2xqam0gz,fakearies1,Nta. You respected his belief. He should also respect your lack of belief in veganism. And im guessing your kids would be even harder to convince and convert than you. Taking care of 4 kids is hard. Dont make it harder on yourself. Ask him to get food himself
4,ati7b2,t2_emq1yvo,jls63," NTA. Have him take a week off work and do all the stuff you do now. Take care of the kids, cook, clean. Now ask him to prepare one dinner for the family and a completely different one for you. Watch how fast the vegan meal request dries up. "
4,ati7b2,t2_7z6ar,vmcla,"NTA But it’s a borderline call for me. Your partnership is based on a division of labour and for now, you have the job of preparing food. His preferences are a big deal.

4,b1b1ft,t2_31o6n3sq,weasledog,NTA. You can turn a person down for any reason or for no reason. Knowing that they can infect you with a disease that doesn’t go away is an excellent reason if you think you need one though.
4,b18npf,t2_npp8l,FlyOnDreamWings,Mostly NTA but a little bit of ESH. He was trashing the place so you had every right to want him gone. You had no responsibility to go after him or ask him to stay. The only thing you could have done was let another of his friends know he left in a state. However since you were probably fuming at that point rational thought wouldn't have come easy.

4,b9irh3,t2_369tum0s,DiamanteDog,NTA - she has been very clear that she did not want to be exclusive and in any event you have not even done anything. 
4,b2m5y5,t2_1mgebpau,footfaceball,"NTA- what he's doing isn't right, and if you want to report him just make sure you're aware of the consequences that could happen"
4,9y824z,t2_bg4sp,Killairmanable,"NTA You definitely should have asked for clarification, but your friend is a total ass. You’re not their butler, and they can get their own water. Not only that but they assaulted you with a blunt object, which only adds to their asshole-ness."
4,aahkj8,t2_zk0q5,Rey16,"NTA. If it was an emergency and the kid was about to wet his pants, then the dad should have said something, which wouldn’t have been unreasonable. It sounded like it was about to be an actual emergency for you. Also, you handled the flight attendant better than I would have. I probably would have gotten pretty detailed with how I was on my period and about to bleed through my pad. "
4,aahkj8,t2_nxd80,lyre34,"NTA, the flight attendant was out of line IMHO. Also, as someone who has raised my kids to respect others, wait their turn, etc., I personally find it frustrating when I encounter other parents that aren't doing the same. "
4,aahkj8,t2_g7knv1f,jolie178923-15423435,"NTA I'm not unsympathetic to the fact that children are less able to ""hold it"" than adults, but if he couldn't wait a minute then his dad should have POLITELY requested to cut ahead of you instead of letting the kid shove past - there's no way I would have allowed my child to do such a rude thing no matter how emergent their need. "
4,aahkj8,t2_lgd9u,Slayer_Of_Anubis,"NTA even in the slightest. Just because he's a child doesn't mean he has any sort of priority on using the restroom. edit: Even if it wasn't an emergency for you and you just kinda had to pee, you have every right to go in and not let him cut"
4,aahkj8,t2_127wwex2,PM_ME_YO_DICK_VIDEOS,"NTA. the flight attendant was an ass. The child was rude. Their lack of planning or bodily awareness does not constitute an emergency for **YOU**! I personally would have been *""vulgar""* and said something about it being an emergency for me and that I didn't want to bleed all over the plane's seat.."
4,aahkj8,t2_6tptb,luseferr,NTA especially due to the fact that the kid tried to push its way past you as you were opening the door. Pandering to that sort of behavior is how you get bratty entitled children which evidently leads to bratty entitled adults. Also the flight attendant can go eat a dick. 
4,aahkj8,t2_28lapqvl,ManateeFlamingo,"NTA. I think the child trying to cut here is what what makes the difference. You were right to stop them. And your reaction to the flight attendant was perfect. I have let kids go head of me, who were waiting patiently, clearly about to burst. But otherwise, they can wait like the rest of us. "
4,aahkj8,t2_3j1xca,Kerlysis,"NTA. If it's that much of an emergency, they should have said something. If someone says, I'm about to hurl out of both ends, and you shove them back, that's assholery. Just not allowing someone to cut is not."
4,aahkj8,t2_7ffwch,TheKappp,"NTA. If it had been a true emergency the dad is kid could have said something instead of just blatantly cutting in front of you. Kids need to learn how society works, and you politely showed him how lines work."
4,aahkj8,t2_21xvcu3k,Dml915,You saved that kid from thinking his exist must be worshipped. It's a rampant problem with alot of parents these days. It's fine to have a tiny bladder but you have to account for that when traveling. Ruling: NTA. The flight attendant was though.
4,aahkj8,t2_u05x8,KatsThoughts,Eh NTA but usually with a kid that young you can always assume it’s an emergency in the sense that they only asked to get up and go pee because they can’t hold it any longer. They’re barely potty trained at that point. 
4,aahkj8,t2_so2yoir,McGuitarpants,"NTA. Not even in the slightest. In my opinion, kids should fly in their own sound proof day care cabin and poop somewhere different than the adults "
4,aahkj8,t2_11rgce,LordCommanderFang,"NTA unless it's a handicap stall and you keep a person with disabilities from using it, it's first come first serve"
4,aahkj8,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"NTA. I would have gone into detail about why it was nearly an emergency for me. :) Heavy days are the worse and unlike urine, there is NOTHING i can do to stop the flow of blood. "
4,aahkj8,t2_5t8m5,eggjuggler,"NTA at all. And that flight attendant is lucky that they didn't get that shitty attitude with a grumpy passenger with IBS, or Crohn's, or a UTI, or, or, or... I mean c'mon, your bodily functions do not need to be a topic of public discussion. "
4,aahkj8,t2_qw0bk,MissLissaxoxo,NTA. The airline attendant and the dad are assholes here. The kid doesn't get a free pass to cut because he's a kid. The dad should've kept an eye on the kid or the very least had said something when he saw his kid doing that.
4,aahkj8,t2_j70lv,kronaz,"NTA. I don't care what the story is, you're never the asshole for not letting people be entitled shits. People need to realize they aren't special and their circumstances don't outrank everyone else's issues. Everyone's in line for the bathroom for the same reason, there's not a hierarchy of how badly each of them needs to go."
4,aahkj8,t2_17jjhe,wander-to-wonder,"NTA. Yes it could’ve been an emergency, however most of the time children are just straight oblivious and only think about themselves. Their brains haven’t developed yet and they have a one tracked mind. It is important for them to learn lessons like this and become aware there is a line and they need to wait in it. I don’t think it was rude. "
4,aahkj8,t2_1ech4wjg,wowdrama,"NTA. Most of you probably haven't experienced the nightmare that is a heavy flow period. It is an emergency, and **it is not something you can hold.** It's constant, and it's not going to stop for even an impatient kid who PROBABLY deserved to learn a lesson in manners from OP. It's clearly evident that the father wasn't teaching them. "
4,aahkj8,t2_16jd08i9,nutritionlabel,"NTA. Look, I have actually let literal strings of children cut in front of me for the bathroom even if I needed it. But the flight attendant should have minded his own business. Unless Dad complained to him about your ""rude"" behavior, where does he get off talking down at you like that? It couldn't have been that much of an emergency if the boy's dad didn't speak up."
4,aahkj8,t2_1fk76r2,dd_coeus,"NTA Children, just like everyone else must learn that everyone has their own time. Just because you are young or just because you’re old you do not get preferential treatment. Let alone the fact that they did not ask."
4,aahkj8,t2_2a1ipgeg,MulysaSemp,"Nta. It wasn't a long line.. I might see letting the kid in front of a longer line of the parent asked apologetically. But they were next, and I assume you didn't take an inordinate amount of time."
4,aahkj8,t2_2e8c4mv2,GoblinTatties,"NTA, kid needs to learn to wait. But if it's obvious a kid is desperate and the parent asks then yeah let em go. Potential period leakage is emergency in my mind though, I've been sweating from anxiety waiting in a queue on a plane cause I thought I'd got my period. It's not fun."
4,aahkj8,t2_xw5ny,fuzzyoctopus97,"NTA. Unless it was an obvious emergency, which by the sounds of it, it really wasn’t, then kids can wait just like everyone else. I promise you that if a kid that age really had to go either them or their parent would have spoken up and been a bit more insistent."
4,aahkj8,t2_7ual2ix,earlgurl33,NTA. That kid and rude ass flight attendant need to go back to kindergarten where we all learned how to wait our turn. 
4,aahkj8,t2_hoe7bkd,physioworld,"NTA. Kids have a way of not being able to hold their bladder and being bad at not knowing when they need to go, but it equally sounds like it was an emergency for you too"
4,aahkj8,t2_25hmjksj,Kk77789,"NTA, the dad would have told the kid to do that most likely so he didnt have to wait around. AHoles on planes should be the title. "
4,aahkj8,t2_j85qv,tif2shuz,"NTA, I’m sure if it was an actual emergency the father could of just asked politely if his kid could cut. Otherwise why are you automatically supposed to let the kid cut. I have a two year old and I’d never expect to just cut a line because I have a young child"
4,aahkj8,t2_62fkqgk,pollenhead,"NTA and I would have had words for the flight attendant's manager about why they shouldn't be lecturing customers or insulting them by calling them rude. Go ahead and make that judgment internally, god knows I do at work, but you don't get to verbalize it to a customer. "
4,aahkj8,t2_9tpg1m7,GirlisNo1,NTA. At all. It seems like the kid just wasn’t familiar with the concept of waiting in line and thought he could just run in. If it was an emergency I would think the dad would speak up and tell you so. Parents like this annoy me because they should be the ones to tell the kid not to do that instead of having the stranger do it. 
4,aahkj8,t2_xuy73,tomrlutong,"NTAH. Dad of two little kids here. If it was an emergency, he would have asked you, and then, well, balance emergencies but maybe refusing is an AH move. As it was, you went above and beyond by teaching manners to somebody else's kid, and I would have thanked you if that dad was me."
4,aahkj8,t2_hk7gk,Red-Droid-Blue-Droid,"NTA I wonder if the flight attendant would rather want to clean up blood? Kids need to learn this stuff anyways. I know kids are very difficult, but we can't let things go to chaos. "
4,aahkj8,t2_wmtou,Sorcha16,"NTA - They should have asked if it was am emergency, you don't just assume and rudely barge in to the front of a cue."
4,aahkj8,t2_jlf74,aoanfletcher2002,"NTA asshole, I would have told my child and the flight attendant that they both need to know how a line works. Children are training for the job of being a big person someday. Just letting them disregard society’s norms doesn’t do them any favors."
4,aahkj8,t2_fe73d,EscalatingEris,"NTA, especially as there was another toilet at the back of the plane. The kid probably learned a valuable lesson about not pushing in front of the queue that day - something that his dad obviously didn't know, or couldn't be bothered to teach him."
4,aahkj8,t2_fva633u,bonio22,"NTA, it was an emergency for you too and it was just unfortunate that the child couldn't hold it"
4,aahkj8,t2_h4ggj,Baltusrol,"NTA - if it was an emergency, the dad could have politely let you know and asked if his son just skip ahead of you. Otherwise, dad should have been the one to tell his child that cutting in line is not acceptable. Dad fail. "
4,aahkj8,t2_15c00l,penelope_pig,"NTA. I have a kid and there have been times when he's needed to use the bathroom urgently. If that's the case I'd politely ask other people in line if he can go first, but if they said no I accepted it and we waited and hoped he didn't pee his pants. Letting him try to cut in line or force his way past someone else would be rude."
4,aahkj8,t2_1un815gk,Avaylon,"NTA If the dad had said something to the effect of it being an emergency it might be different. Letting his kid try to push in front of you and not trying to correct the behavior is rude, though. Fine year olds are old enough to be taught manners."
4,aahkj8,t2_2oq2y0g1,anepau78,"NTA. You were next in line, you were polite and had an emergency, just like you told the flight attendant."
4,aahkj8,t2_2qsdpvk3,banana0vanna,NTA you taught the kid a lesson. It obviously wasn't an emergency if the kid had JUST gotten up and dad wasnt even right there with them. Plus if it was an emergency kids do the potty dance usually. Had you let them cut in line who knows how long they could have taken.
4,aahkj8,t2_3xoccz,Neravariine,NTA. The kid needs to learn basic manners like waiting till it's his turn. The father could have asked to go ahead of you if it really was an emergency but he didn't so it wasn't that urgent. 
4,aahkj8,t2_2vesadgs,HeadlessDuckRider,"NTA If you just needed a leak then you would've been one but you extremely needed the bathroom, plus the flight attendant was a total asshole and thus u shouldn't even care if you were or weren't an asshole as he didn't handle the situation well. "
4,aahkj8,t2_2i4zgeh5,banable_blamable,NTA but you were cutting it close. Children And the elderly are given more privileged in society because they physically cannot control their bodies as well. If you don't understand this then you are an asshole. 
4,aahkj8,t2_wnx7v9d,RelevantLeg,"YTA, you could’ve gone up to change earlier since you knew the situation - you put this ”emergency” on yourself. Kids are less able to plan ahead in this way, and have a harder time with bladder control. Kid is just a kid, he/she shouldn’t have tried to cut, but you could’ve asked the parent to confirm if it’s an emergency or not. No one wants pee all over the airplane floor! "
4,aahkj8,t2_17gv99,jayne-eerie,"YTA, sorry. (But only a little bit of one) When little kids need to go, they need to GO. Usually there’s about a three-minute window before there’s pee everywhere. I understand that you were in your own desperate situation, but typically adults aren’t going to wet their pants if they wait three minutes. That said, I wouldn’t expect somebody who doesn’t have kids of their own to necessarily know that."
4,ady61s,t2_11c7hval,clutzycook,"NTA. Your daughter is 7 and I presume is in school for most of the day. She could easily find a part time job to accommodate the time that she is out of school. She might look into getting a job with your daughter's school/school district. That way, she can be off when your daughter is off."
4,ady61s,t2_l4ppc7g,mstrhiei,NTA. One sole provider days are gone. The fact that you’ve made it this long on a single income is mind boggling to me. None of my friends who live in 14 different states could survive off one single income. 
4,ady61s,t2_2i0z1tcj,Oilfreeeggs,Nta. Your wife needs to get off her ass and get a job . You are living above your means and something needs to change . I would of loved to stay at home but I also want to eat and have new clothes occasionally so I went back to work in the evening's
4,ady61s,t2_eqw0p,Thelonius16,NTA. There's really no excuse to be a stay-at-home parent after the kid starts school. Sounds like she's lazy or too scared of being incapable of doing whatever job it would be.
4,a8pz3y,t2_1lvc81je,P_Flange,NTA. You tried to talk to them and they instead chose to do things last minute. You not being there is a direct consequence of their inability to plan ahead. If they don't like it then they know how to stop it happening in the future.
4,a8pz3y,t2_s3vvgeq,lurkylurkeroo,"NTA, and may I have some of your ham? Your family are out of line. You did everything reasonable to organise a time and date, they failed to adult. Don't feel guilty. "
4,b23fq8,t2_2rkkwp7r,-Error404-Not-Found-,"NTA - if you always please your cat it will probably try out how far it can go at other things, too. IMO it’s good to show your pets that YOU are the boss and there are rules and boundaries which apply for them - they can’t just always do what they want! "
4,ad5aco,t2_zk0q5,Rey16,"NTA. Get the locks changed on the house so they can’t move in without you giving them the keys. And the sell the thing and be done with it since your father gave you power of attorney. If your mother is so worried about helping your BIL, then she can co-sign on an apartment or condo. From the information provided in your post and replies, your parents are just enabling them to not get their shit together. You also may want to post this over in r/legal advice "
4,b2j231,t2_6myjf,yamoth,"YTA - That is such a petty thing to do that I don't even know where to start... There is a whole host of reason why the professor would decide to extend the due date. Furthermore, that extension doesn't hurt you or your education, I don't see any legitimate reason for you to be upset over this."
4,b2j231,t2_u29mj,snarkravingmad,"NTA You complied with the stated parameters. He changed the parameters to the benefit of the procrastinators. I think you totally deserve extra points for adhering to the original deadline. Good for you for raising the idea--if you don't ask, you don't get. The worst he can do is say ""no""."
4,b8r848,t2_3j3qv7co,asshole-armchair,"> My stance is: ""we're at a dive bar up the street on a Tuesday night. It's not like we're at a 4 star black tie affair. **Nobody cares**, lighten up"" Your girlfriend cares, YTA for being inconsiderate not only to her, but also *potentially* the persons around you. "
4,ari61r,t2_177obv,iconjurer,"NTA, waking people up for your own comfort when there are multiple alternatives is a huge asshole move. If the damned airbed was so important he should have dealt with it earlier when making that kind of nose was reasonable. I'd be pissed about that, too, that's a huge dick move. Super inconsiderate. "
4,ari61r,t2_1wgoxii5,DisneyBride28,NTA the time to inflate the air mattress was not 4am when everyone was already asleep. He was a jerk to wake everyone and displace other sleeping guests. Should've set it up much earlier if he really wanted it. 
4,b5u7l6,t2_34zth5fe,alwaystired7,NTA. I don’t understand why they wouldn’t send out save the dates because those are pretty important to ensure that people will be able to come. She’s the asshole for being mad that people can’t come after she fucked up.
4,b5u7l6,t2_n7y0zq6,MfknHoHo,"NTA. I'm a boring middle aged woman, and even I have plans booked more than a month in advance. If she genuinely wanted people to attend, she would have given a minimum of 3 months warning."
4,b5u7l6,t2_zab64,craig_prime,"NTA. She's ""flipping her shit"" because she fucked up and most of her guest list can't come. You have a better reason than most. I bet the most common reason is that it's just too little notice."
4,b5u7l6,t2_2wv6u4dh,IntrovertedShutIn,"NTA. Save The Dates aren't just a courtesy, they're a necessity. People have other obligations. Jobs, important family events, babysitters to arrange. One month isn't enough time to plan half a wedding, let alone inform potential guests. If I manage to purchase a non refundable ticket to a foreign country, you bet your ass I'll be going. Enjoy Australia, OP!"
4,b5u7l6,t2_2o8413wz,misstiff1971,"NTA, she had been invited on the trip. She knew when it was. She should have told you all ages ago when the wedding was scheduled."
4,b5u7l6,t2_2xbijl6d,BluPens,NTA. She knew about your plans and *still* went ahead and gave a one month notice. And now she has to deal with the fact that almost 50% of her guests are not gonna come.
4,b5u7l6,t2_hguhx,RiotGrrr1,NTA. One month notice is no notice at all. Can’t believe she expects people to come. At this point she should reschedule to wedding if it’s that important people go and give 6 months notice. 
4,b5u7l6,t2_2jcujfgd,majesticjules,NTA She didn't give enough notice. Even a small wedding takes longer than a month to plan. I think she had a date picked a while ago and just didn't tell anyone.
4,b5u7l6,t2_zmjh74j,Bangbangsmashsmash,"NTA, you have made plans that are not able to be changed. Even an informal, “I’m getting married on this day,” would have been a big help. It’s not your fault that she gave you one months notice. Do not drop your entire trip over a few hours of a party. "
4,b5u7l6,t2_1lrfbfqy,LoriTheGreat1,"NTA. If she is your best friend and your presence is so important, she should have consulted with you about your availability. Send a gift and go enjoy your vacation. She should have planned better"
4,b5u7l6,t2_6f0xz,mug3n,NTA. she needed to send save the dates. weddings aren't really something you can just go to spur of the moment.
4,b5u7l6,t2_1zq3l5hc,ChaoticForkingGood,"NTA. You told her about the trip, and not only did she ignore that, but she also gave half of what the lead time for invitations usually is. You understandably can't take the financial hit. This is all on her."
4,b5u7l6,t2_nd7ra,here_kitkittkitty,NTA!! this is the risk she took by waiting so long to send out invites. not everyone can change their life around on that short of notice. 
4,b5u7l6,t2_18yyoq,happytre3s,Nta. She should have sent save the dates 4-6 months in advance and invites should have gotten to you 8 weeks in advance. Lack of planning and information sharing on her part does not constitute a emergency on your end. 
4,b5u7l6,t2_13ei9t,Cad_Monkey_Mafia,"NTA. If you want most people you invite to be able to attend, then save the dates should be sent 6 months in advance, with the formal invitation with details sent 1-2 months in advance. She either did this on purpose or is a victim of her own ineptitude. You did nothing wrong. I'd go on the trip too."
4,b5u7l6,t2_2xffqing,strawberrypockystix,NTA. She definitely screwed up by not sending out a Save the Date months in advance. The fact that you guys invited her to the trip is the cherry on top. Either it totally slipped her mind or they planned the wedding after you booked the trip.
4,b5u7l6,t2_icgzt,LordJiraiya,"NTA. She needs to plan her wedding further in advance so people can make plans accordingly. Go on your trip, you are not obliged to cancel plans you already made for something she's just dropped on you last second."
4,b5u7l6,t2_59rj2gz,VieilleFille69,NTA My best friend got married in a foreign country and she skyped the ceremony by the way. It's not the same as being here but you can still have a party before and be somehow present during the wedding even if you're in australia
4,b5u7l6,t2_zj4m3,A_Redheads_Ramblings,"NTA &#x200B; Wedding etiquette states; For a destination wedding, it is customary to mail save the dates 8 to 12 months in advance. For a local affair, send save the dates 4 months in advance. Follow your save the dates with your formal invitations about 8 weeks before the wedding. &#x200B; Common sense say if you send out invites a month before your event you shouldn't be surprised when people can't turn up. &#x200B; Good manners say you should be gracious if people say they can't attend."
4,b5u7l6,t2_350vqyp3,ClaraElizabethCohen,"NTA. An invite doesn't mean you are obligated to go, it should just be giving you the details should you be able to."
4,b5u7l6,t2_6sov2,Etaec,"NTA, problem is she also booked the event and there's no refunds. Just unfortunate but shes not handling it very well. Weddings are supposed to be high stress or maybe she's always an ass not enough info."
4,b5u7l6,t2_1fxcqtwv,LegendarySysAdmin,"NTA. The whole idea of ***ASKING*** someone if they can come is that they can say ""Yes"", ""No"", or ""Maybe"". It's on her for the late notice. If you want to save face you can offer to do dinner upon your return? I've done that in similar situations. Still, something tells me this may not satisfy the Bridezilla but it's worth a shot."
4,b5u7l6,t2_p1lof,BrewtalDoom,NTA! What is it about weddings that makes some people think that the whole world needs to stop and accommodate them? You can't give a single month's notice for something like that and then be pissed when people already have plans. Your friend needs to grow up.
4,b5u7l6,t2_15jhqz,Wingolf,"NTA, you have very expensive plans made and can't be expected to drop them last second because she decided one month is enough notice l"
4,b5u7l6,t2_mfeco,rhetoricetc,"NAH but a little bit more NTA because planning a wedding is stressful, but it's unreasonable to invite people within a month and then be bothered they can't make it."
4,avz5z7,t2_5bk68mv,oneofyrfencegrls,"NTA. He isn't babysitting, these are things that he should be able to do and should do on a regular basis. He's a parent, not a substitute teacher. And you shouldn't have thanked him. Taking care of what is also his child is an expected duty, not extra. "
4,9ttnjb,t2_ac3f7,Codadd,Saw the first sentence. Nta. The again dont get a pet if you cant train it properly and take care of it. You and your wife are assholes for that reason but not for wanting to get rid of it
4,ag33bc,t2_tqw4an2,thesquirrelmasta,"NTA. I was tempted to go the other way when I thought it was an all expenses paid trip. But I see that it is far from all expenses paid. And it sounds like you have to spend a good deal of money, gas, and time cleaning up. Not to mention the extra wear and miles on your vehicle. I can see how you find this situation unbalanced. NTA"
4,akne2c,t2_l37x0v,Mejai91,"NTA, but you know she probably liked you... Coming from someone that should have made more moves in high school, you should have made a move"
4,amih70,t2_cd9a3,NoFleas,NTA - her behavior was impacting you indirectly and making your work time more of a drag than it needed to be. 
4,ai9yw5,t2_rmgkxu,n4sum,NTA Do I really have to say that it’s shitty of a husband to prioritize a flirty secretary over his wife? Based off this I’m 98% positive they’re having an affair. Make of that what you will.
4,ai9yw5,t2_1to0qqa2,MikkiTh,"NTA But there's a simple solution, a shared calendar for husband and wife that would ping him with a lunch alarm on the days she's coming by. He should get rid of the secretary but I get why he doesn't see the problem. It's not happening in her work, she's just being petty at random and is probably otherwise good at her job. "
4,ai9yw5,t2_9yunowa,daisiesanddaffodils,"NTA, but he doesn't even need to fire her, just go straight to her and make it clear that he always wants to hear from his wife if she calls or stops by. Just call her out directly? She'll probably be embarrassed enough to stop."
4,ai9yw5,t2_1m0abdfm,LivingAtAltitude,NTA The husband is the problem. If he can't tell his secretary that his wife gets priority over anything then the red flags are flying.
4,ai9yw5,t2_zmjh74j,Bangbangsmashsmash,"NTA, you have brought it up as a problem, your husband needs to address it and simply say, “I need you to do a better job making sure my wife’s messages get to me.”"
4,ai9yw5,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"NTA. She's making your life harder, and why she wants is you to give up and stop coming in. He needs to fire her or warn her that if she doesn't stop this, she's fired immediately. Giving messages is her job."
4,ai9yw5,t2_22yxkvyt,AAAWorkAccount,"YTA - If the secretary is great at what she does, then she shouldn't be fired for her otherwise immature tiff with the wife. Good secretaries are hard to find and they're worth their weight in gold. I've had bad secretaries. I've had medium secretaries. I've only ever had 2 good secretaries. When you have a good secretary you do whatever you can to keep them, even if that means indulging her in her petty games."
4,b6u8t6,t2_2xjzy5,Otherwise_Window,"NTA. Move on. Sometimes around when people go to college, the friends we had before... stop working. Friendships in childhood and adolescence sort of happen by default. You acquire a wider world, more options, and suddenly you might find you're not really compatible any more."
4,a9yfco,t2_2i978w5p,ailuropholly,"NTA, but should've handled it differently.

4,a9yfco,t2_1yfz9r4,foxylipsforever,Nta. You just didn't know how to handle the sitiation. A better idea would have been to talk to a female teacher or more experienced faculty to help you address this.
4,a9yfco,t2_l8ld4,moncoeurquibat,"YTA. I'm a teacher too. You should have asked a female colleague to talk to her. You put yourself in a dangerous position and you could get in serious trouble for this. Even if your intentions are good, you did not handle this professionally. "
4,a9yfco,t2_q1b7igf,MrsMinnesota,"Nta. You aren't a creep, she should behave with some decorum and class. I would however have a meeting with your superiors and let them know what's happened. God knows teenagers can be vindictive little assholes and you want to have all your bases covered. "

4,a9yfco,t2_pkg16pl,Uraveragefanboi77,"You’re NTA, but you could have handled it better. Now you have no choice but to hold her back after class and fully explain yourself. And that’s ignoring the fact she shouldn’t have been having her feet up anyway. Just tell her it was making you uncomfortable and ask her not to do it again. I think the latter was your big initial mistake."

4,arogct,t2_2t360skz,sarahequalswin,"YTA if the places pay waitress wages versus min. wage. You can usually tell this if there is an option to go in, sit down, and be waited on. My cousin worked for Outback Steakhouse for a while doing to-go orders and I can confirm they make the same amount of money as you would waiting tables. If I’m ever unsure, I call and ask at a separate time. Generally places where you order your food at a counter and then can sit down inside don’t pay waitress wages so I don’t tip them."

So, if you tip in advance, the driver doesn't necessarily even get any extra money."
4,arnomi,t2_6rj74,enna12,"NTA You're just tipping with cash. That's not assholey. It's not much different than when you pay with a credit card at a restaurant and tip with cash instead of adding the tip to the card. In fact, I'm sure they prefer cash because they don't have to report it as income."

4,b7t4ag,t2_imeqb,zenthrowaway17,"YTA Living extensively within, especially being raised in, a culture is *pretty much* what makes you a part of that culture.

4,b7t4ag,t2_336vfumj,peonypegasus,"YTA. He is not ""saying he is one culture when he's not"" because he is of an Italian cultural background. Italian culture was passed down by his (Italian) family, with love and appreciation. Clearly his by-blood Italian family thinks that both he and his mother are Italian because they aren't getting caught up in whether his DNA came from Italy or not. "
4,b7t4ag,t2_3i857w46,yamihere2day,"YTA, as a daughter of an asian woman who was adopted by white parents I am actually offended by what you are implying.... why do you insist on labelling by etnicity like this? He has been raised italian, and feels italian and that is his right. "
4,b7t4ag,t2_2pdpf3za,pokesurvivor,"YTA. Culture isn't determined ONLY by blood, it's also where and how someone grew up. He was raised in an Italian family, that's the world he's most familiar with. "
4,b7t4ag,t2_2r56f90t,MrsSUGA,"YTA. this is the literal opposite of cultural appropriation. Things like this are the reason why people dont take that concept seriously. he doesnt just cook italian and speak italian. He was raised in an italian household and within that italian culture. He may not be ethnically italian, but he is culturally. if thats how he identifies culturally, you have no say in that. "
4,b7t4ag,t2_stmb6,halftherevolution,"YTA. Your cultural identity is the culture you were raised with, not necessarily your ethnicity. He wants to celebrate the culture and history that made him the person that he is, that's awesome.

"
4,b7t4ag,t2_x3jb0w9,too_many_gatos,"YTA Your boyfriend is culturally Italian if he was raised by Italians. You do not get to gatekeep people's identity. This would be much more different if he had zero connection and knowledge of Italian culture then I would agree with you about him appropriating a culture. I was born in another country but grew up in the US, around people of my same ethnicity but I also consider myself American. am I not American?"
4,b7t4ag,t2_6bkl5,BagelsAndJewce,"So I’m not American because my blood is from El Salvador? Am I appropriating American culture because I was raised in it? Listen to how ignorant you sound.

4,b7t4ag,t2_2wt68k77,WellLatteDa,"In case you hadn't heard, Italian isn't a race. How do you know if he has any Italian ""blood"" in him? Just because his mother was adopted he's not allowed to have a cultural history? What a cruel and heartless thing to put on someone. YTA without question."
4,b7t4ag,t2_30yhnz3v,losschabossdragon,"YTA that’s pretty racist „drop of blood“ and all, he grew up in that culture and then you come and think he is not part of that culture because you decide so . Wow"
4,b7t4ag,t2_17djpf,Azuilll,"YTA. It's like saying to the parent of an adopted child they aren't REALLY your child because they were adopted. If this is how his mother, and he in turn was raised, as part of an Italian family, then he is Italian. The way you're phrasing the cultural appropriation aspect of this is like, he decided to wake up one day and start calling himself Italian. He didn't, this is how he was raised. Cultures and traditions aren't as clear cut as ""you are x nationality or culture, stay in your lane""."
4,b7t4ag,t2_14xww8j1,Band1c0t,"YTA why he's saying he's Italian bugging you? If he raised or born in Italy means he's Italian, or if you're citizen from that country then you're from that country. The level of ignorance and is very high in this post, wake up op."

4,b7t4ag,t2_2a2we1ds,KevinMMahon,"YTA. If someone says they're American, and yet they are a first or second generation immigrant from South America or something, you wouldn't tell them they are ""appropriating american culture"".

4,b7t4ag,t2_mpm8sqh,Juggletrain,"YTA First off, it doesn't matter. Stop eating pizza and shit if you think it does to you because that shots totally misappropriated. Second, he was raised as an Italian American, so he is an Italian American. Dudes not claiming he just got off the boat from Sicily."
4,b7t4ag,t2_23jqb4x5,Actual_grill,"YTA. Very much so. His mother in a way became Italian, when she was ADOPTED and raised by an Italian family. His GRANDPARENTS were Italian. Who are you to say they are any less his family just because his mother was adopted by them? The way you discount his bond with his family and his upbringing is quite honestly disgusting. How can he appropriate a culture he literally grew up within?"
4,b7t4ag,t2_x76h8,Idunnoow,"YTA. You need to learn what it means to appropriate a culture and chill the fuck out. It's extremely disrespectful to say something like ""Oh, but you're not TRULY x y or z because of some trivial reason despite being raised like that your whole life"". Who are you to say that? By your post, you're insulting him, his mother, as well as the household that he's been raised in."
4,b7t4ag,t2_11g1c5,Gamma_cleavage,"YTA. Italian is a nationality, not an ethnicity. Any Italian American that’s not an asshole would tell you that this guy is way more Italian than us for speaking it, and any actual Italian will tell you that the reason this guy is not Italian has nothing to do with blood. Damn."

4,b7t4ag,t2_36a42j1t,Ava626,"YTA. The only thing about him that is not Italian, is his DNA. His family is Italian, he was raised the Italian way, speaks Italian. Who are you to say he is 'appropriating' a culture? A culture does not belong to one single person, so how can it be appropriated? You are being narrow minded and are looking for a problem where there isn't one. "
4,b7t4ag,t2_1oq0ls5p,pukui7,YTA Italian culture is not equivalent to Italian genetic ancestry. You can have one without the other. He was raised Italian and that's a lot more than just cooking and language.

Are you only keeping the youngest around as potential labour & back up if the oldest is incapacitated? Sorry if my questions come across as harsh, but you do seem to prefer the oldest child even if it is just because of a feudalistic view of family dynamics. Not cool to effectively tell a little kid that he's not as important as his brother. I hope he doesn't get lasting mental damage from it. "

I don't think there's anything wrong with having the oldest son run the business (assuming he is mature and willing to) however to bring this up to a 9 year old who will likely be extremely jealous seems wrong to me.

Even civil court would take into consideration that 6 years of use devalues an item, so it's no longer worth the full price he paid 6 years ago.

Then he's free to pay the difference for the upgrade."
4,akdbqk,t2_87r3qr6,SmallCubes,"YTA The way you dealt with this situation is clearly wrong.

4,b43t53,t2_9csxlft,CordovanCorduroys,NTA. You should absolutely share your good fortune with the mother of your children. Also please see a financial advisor so you don’t lose it all and end up back and square one. 
4,b43t53,t2_13b3r3,Aspy17,"NTA, far from it. I have great respect for you. Recognizing that the mother of your children is deserving of a share of your windfall is pretty damn awesome. "
4,b43t53,t2_18x09ip0,LifeExplorer64,"NTA your gf is way off base, you ex is the mother of your children … that is a bond that will never go away. Giving you ex and kids some of the money is a really decent thing to do. You have no idea how far a decent co-parenting relationship goes with regards to the well being of your kids and those kids are your priority."
4,b43t53,t2_p8ysc,Cripnite,NTA. You’re doing the right thing despite your past mistakes. You’re taking care of the mother of your children and your children. There’s nothing wrong with that. You respect her enough to do that and that’s a good thing. Buuuut you need to find a way to discuss this civilly with your current girlfriend as it is obviously a sore spot for her. 
4,b43t53,t2_yok4h,htimsmc369,"NTA, you are taking care of your children by way of taking care of their mother, and if every father saw it that way, the world would be a better place and there would be more happy, healthy children. "
4,b43t53,t2_cith0,Sectiontwo,"NTA, good on you. Seems like your current relationship needs to end given your description of the relief, as well as the other things. Plus it's a relationship built on cheating, that's not likely to be healthy. I wonder how many choosing beggars PM'd you asking to give them the money instead"
4,b43t53,t2_10q3ph,SirVeryBritishFellow,"NTA. You did fuck up in the past, but you've accepted it, and wanting to give some of the money to your ex-wife is very commendable. I'm glad you don't intend to change your plans, your current girlfriend is being very childish, in my opinion."
4,b43t53,t2_8lg5n,DonHozy,"NTA. However, your gf, most definitely is. You're trying to share your good fortune with the mother of your two children; how can that be viewed as wrong? This is a red flag, regarding your gf, if ever there was one. If she keeps threatening to leave; show her the door... &#x200B;"
4,b43t53,t2_gitkg,pm_me_your_molars,"NTA, but I'm actually commenting to advise you to think very carefully about how you tell your ex that you're giving her the money in a way that lets her keep her dignity. Some people get very uncomfortable for perceived ""handouts"". Choose your words well!"
4,b43t53,t2_ssmo1,The_Perfect_Dick_Pic,NTA You’re essentially investing money in your children’s well-being. I don’t see what value there would be in having a person around that doesn’t see that. 
4,b43t53,t2_4eb36,manofsea,"NTA. Your relationship with your ex wife is healthy, you current should probably become your ex and you should move on but that is none of my business. "
4,b43t53,t2_n5k4z,RSZephoria,"NTA, and wow. The first thought your ex had, at least verbally, was that you treat the kids. I would definitely give her a nice chunk of change. She did right by you and hasn't kept the kids from you or their paternal grandparents it seems. She sounds like a great person. No comment about your gf as you are asking if you are the asshole, not anyone else. "
4,b43t53,t2_pbk79,navit47,NTA at all. good on you for caring for your kids and making sure they know that you will still support them. although I do question a job at the public library being shitty and paying peanuts. I thought most library positions pay relatively well and give you those sweet government benefits.
4,b43t53,t2_35937dzv,jenski1987,Obviously NTA. The world needs more coparents like you! You made a mistake but soubds like yiu and your ex did an amazing job of salvaging the relstionship for the sake of the kids. I think current gf is insecure. I am glad you are convicted enough to see that. 
4,b43t53,t2_4rjtguz,nerdyandnatural,"NTA definitely. You could have kept the money and ran away with your gf, but the fact that you thought of your ex-wife and kids means that you want the best for them. The gf is overreacting, especially considering the circumstance of how you two ended up together. You may want to reconsider that relationship and make a clean start."
4,b43t53,t2_2w2toyow,Nephyllem,"NTA, even if there is a subconscious level of emotion there you’re also supporting your kids. Like there’s a good amount of assholes that would do the bare minimum and fuck off. You’re trying to support them and that’s all that matters."
4,b43t53,t2_109xpe,jabberingginger,100 times over NTA. Your current partner has no leg to stand on. You are taking care of your babies and their mother which is far more important. Your current partner is a home wrecker which usually means she’s probably pretty selfish to begin with so...there’s that. Kind of a big red flag if she thinks taking care of your kids isn’t more important than whatever she wanted. 
4,b43t53,t2_1c8gxeky,chancelaf,"NTA in the slightest you sound like a great guy, I wish my parents acted more like you and your ex when they divorced after my mom had an affair. "
4,b43t53,t2_7r5bz,nathan1942,"NTA. Your girlfriend has no right to the money or how you spend it. It's up to you how much you want to give away to friends family and charities. I would see this is a red flag because she may now want to stay with you for the money, something to keep in mind."
4,b43t53,t2_348zy39j,pineapplebaconjaps,"NTA. and if what you're feeling about your gf's threats to leave is relief, you should take that and run with it. help her pack. make a clean break and find someone who has their head screwed on straight. should you decide to stay, I'd be real cautious. as in, be absolutely certain there can be no sudden ""unplanned"" pregnancy. "
4,b43t53,t2_8hl85,ParadiseSold,"NTA I think you did the thing that would be best for your kids. I think wanting to do right by someone you wronged in the past. Co-parent beats girlfriend, IMO. However, I can understand why your girlfriend felt betrayed and undervalued. Try to listen to her perspective."
4,b43t53,t2_30a3g5l6,ImInClassRightMeow,"NTA, and I don't see how you would be. Your ex takes care of your children and the fact that you are mature enough to appreciate that and offer her money speaks volume about your character."
4,b43t53,t2_mgilv,michikokopuffs,NTA. It is your money and she will always be part of your extended family. Caring for your kids and their mother when you can isn't bad in any way. You should be proud of your decision. It sounds healthy and well-considered. 
4,b43t53,t2_rbcq8,CjBoomstick,"NTA. I've said this to a couple of my friends and I'll say it again: **Your actions in this scenario will not have a negative outcome for either party, nor will they negatively affect anyone involved. You DO NOT owe ANYONE an explanation, excuse, ANYTHING AT ALL just because you are in a relationship with them, no matter how intimate or otherwise.** You won a fuck you amount of money. No one would bat a fucking eye if you gave it to charity. Tell your girlfriend to quit being selfish and justifying YOUR actions with her own feelings and light some of that money on fucking fire. "
4,b43t53,t2_yjg4t,kirakirst,"NTA and in fact, sound like a wonderful human being. Sure, you fucked up in the past, but it sounds like you’re taking responsibility and are putting your kids first. If you’re relieved by the threats of your gf breaking up, then... I guess it’s time to break up."
4,b43t53,t2_jr0nvl7,silverbullet52,"NTA. As a practical matter, the ex might have sued if you hadn't ante'd up. GF's tantrum is also predictable. Large amounts of money aren't as much fun or consequence-free as they are in our imaginings."
4,b43t53,t2_nwgcx,somesnazzyname,NTA- its your money to do with as you wish. If I was the girlfriend I'd be all about keeping you sweet not annoying you now your options have widened and your stock has risen.
4,b43t53,t2_2bzksy,LouieNet,"NTA I'll refrain from ""judgy"" comments about your GF, but you might want to re-evaluate your relationship with her. In Calif., you would probably have to give a percentage of your winnings to your ex-wife anyway. You're a good person to have given her the money to ease her life and that of your kids without her pushing for a legal order. And I suspect that she knows that you're a good person at heart."
4,b43t53,t2_2y2ex3ki,OliveGS,"NTA. I don't know what a ""fuck you"" amount of money means. Strange way of expressing it. Regardless, its your money and you have an obligation to your ex and your kids so I think it is very appropriate for you to give a large amount to your ex. Your gf has no claim on you and has no say so tell her to stfu or hit the road."
4,b43t53,t2_1c0haj1r,dumpylumpkinz,"NTA at all. You should however dump your gf because she is a huge a-hole. Also, huge respect to you for being a good enough person to reflect and fix things from the time when you were more of an early work in progress! I want to be you when I grow up."
4,b43t53,t2_eq8m6pz,UnihornWhale,NTA At all. This is the mother of your children who has been nothing but great to you. This would enable her to be a better parent and join you in providing a great life for your kids. Your GF’s reaction is completely insane and out of line. The fact that you’re relieved she threatened to leave should tell you everything you need to know.
4,b43t53,t2_1r7cumud,lykaboss10,"NTA You have kids togther, your providing for them and their mother who is their primary career. Seems a decent move to me. "
4,b43t53,t2_hhy3h,isingthedarkness,"NTA! It's a wonderful kind gesture, that at a minimum would increase the quality of life for your children. If your current partner is upset about how you treat any ex, they are more concerned with how you treat them, not how you treat anyone else in your life. My ex, on the other hand, I'd send money to buy a broom to clean up his own fucking mess."
4,b43t53,t2_2py6bmg2,howabout22,NTA - she is still your baby mamma and you are taking care of your kids by helping her out. Actually there are some girls (not your GF ofc) who would respect you more for this. I also do see your GFs side but she needs to get over it.
4,b43t53,t2_13myy1,AzizOfArabia,"NTA. You're a good man, sir. Can you give it to her in terms of stocks or investments? That's better than straight out cash that can be wasted. Or at least part this part that. "
4,b43t53,t2_verqh,Lancerlandshark,"NTA. You're looking out for your family. Even though you're not with your ex, her quality of life affects your kids', and it's very clear that you appreciate her too. All of that is all the justification you need. Your girlfriend either needs to understand that or let it go as a decision that is not negotiable."
4,aqy4bn,t2_24jhr5n1,jsp8854,"NTA. You’re 15 and wanted your privacy during a brief but vulnerable moment in your life. Honestly it’s kind of weird that he insisted on staying in the room for the whole thing. Actually, it’s really weird."
4,aqy4bn,t2_2z1kyivp,Respectable_Coyote,"Next time have this conversation with the physician or doctor. Ask them to make a note on your records that you do not want anybody with you during examinations. If you're able to express an opinion about your treatment, it should be respected. NTA"
4,aqy4bn,t2_376ji5g2,pigs_is_hams,"The only reason I would insist on being in the room for my stepkid's physical is if I was getting a weird vibe from the doctor and didn't want to leave them alone with him/her. That is the only good reason. Although, based on what he said during the argument later, that wasn't the case here and he was just violating your privacy. You're NTA."
4,aqy4bn,t2_2kpxvef3,SnowyBug,"NTA He should've respected your privacy. He may be of the mindset that you're both guys and there's nothing to be ashamed of, but he still should've respected your wishes."
4,aqy4bn,t2_16slpd,T_86,"NTA - not sure of how it works where you are but in Canada at 15 you can legally speak for yourself medically and everything is confidential. If you expressed to the doctor that you didn’t want your stepdad in the room, they would have forced him to leave. "
4,aqy4bn,t2_t0gra,Rivka333,NTA. You should be able to set those sorts of boundaries. >You used to walk around all the time in your underwear It's not unusual for someone's modesty levels to change. He should respect your current boundaries over your past ones.
4,aqy4bn,t2_oq2z78d,philosophunc,"Nta, your space and your own sense of decency are important. Dint need that manly gym locker room bullshit everywhere. And definately dint need it to be forced upon you by a step dad. "
4,aqy4bn,t2_1oq0ls5p,pukui7,"NTA At 15, you know your boundaries and comfort zones. Whether or not SD likes or agrees with it, he should still respect your feelings. But we're talking about getting down to your underwear. Do you never go swimming? Are you unable to change clothes in the locker room? Has your SD made fun of your appearance before? Your SD might REALLY not understand the seriousness of your attitude. More often than not, people just don't have a problem stripping down this way in this kind of setting. Still, his lack of respect is much more of an issue, I think."
4,b5jdwq,t2_2f3akm7l,cbhtrash,YTA for not only making an empty threat but being offended she’s sticking by her views. I would have said No assholes here from the title but you’re the asshole. 
4,b9dxwa,t2_5i2rh,elusivemoniker,"NTA. You deserve a medal for calling out your hypocritical and emotionally destructive colleague.That program deserves to be shut down for basically encouraging an eating disorder. I'm surprised her coaches and counselors haven't caught on and commented about the abuse, especially if CPS was involved."
4,b9dxwa,t2_dsflb,Delicious_Albino,NTA. Oh my god that’s horrible. I’ve dealt with eating disorders my entire life almost and that’s what this is going to cause. I hope that child gets away from her mother soon. You did the right thing by calling CPS. Don’t feel bad. 
4,b9dxwa,t2_w4uep37,shakka74,"Call the district attorney’s office to open a complaint on this dieting organization. They should have a policy of only taking clients over 18. It may be a shot in the dark, but a DA that’s running for office and looking to get some press, might be open to opening an investigation into this org. Also call your Congressional representative for the same. It’s how many states were able to get momentum to ban dangerous conversion therapies on LGBQT kids."
4,b9dxwa,t2_9e30w,boudy567,"NTA This was tough because it seems you wanted us to judge the fact you made a comment on the diet and not on the behavior of co-worker, which is kind of a dick move BUT the fact you did it to try and protect the girl gets you a pass."
4,b9dxwa,t2_s6h2m,kriahfox,"NTA, this woman is unbelievable. But geez, these posts have a way of giving me whiplash between the assumption the headline gives me and the actual content."
4,b9dxwa,t2_ojd70,XEssentialCryIceIs,"NTA At 115 lbs, 5'8"", and being an athlete this poor kid was already seriously underweight. Anorexia kills, and when it doesn't the effects are usually lifelong. So personally I think the only reason you could possibly be considered an asshole is for not doing more to confront Annie's abuse. "
4,b9dxwa,t2_11wjj5,not_your_bird,"NTA. I was all geared up to snap at you before I read the post, but that is horrifying. The only bright side here is that theoretically the daughter will be away from her mom soon. "
4,akifn8,t2_2y7kdiak,NekrozQliphort,"Definitely NTA. But my advice would be to keep an eye out for her just in case, but at the same time, don't approach her about this as she probably wouldn't listen to any of your advice until she starts to realize it herself. Maybe ask your best friend to keep an eye on her (but again just observe for now). Just my two cents."
4,ag9jwg,t2_2qxp8cfo,HuntingIvy,YTA. Clearly. I'm concerned you say that the school can't do more to monitor. There is software and work arounds to better monitor her online activity at school. They should be able to lock down her access if there is a history of contacting predators. PM me if you need details. I do this for a living.
4,ag9jwg,t2_d6fvsf8,EmpiricalAnarchism,"YTA: >I think she should have thought of that before she got herself involved with perverts online. Yet, you want her to have literally no ability to have any privacy. I wonder why your daughter feels comfortable around perverts. Perhaps because her father is one? Regardless, you are the asshole."
4,ag9jwg,t2_l5544,Shawaii,"YTA &#x200B; What your ex does in her house is up to her. Your daughter does need some privacy, but does not need any electronics in her room. Suggest that your ex moves all electronics to a family space, or even your Ex's room."
4,ag9jwg,t2_nyzgpa7,HodgkinsNymphona,YTA Judging from your responses you are also overly controlling in a creepy kind of way and will likely force your daughter to rebel in a dangerous way. All of you need to see a therapist.
4,ag9jwg,t2_2p99ti5i,suckboisupreme,"YTA. Instead of continuing to react and treat her the way that you do, which is no doubt driving her directly into the arms of these predatory individuals you want her to avoid, you could sit and read some of these comments and REALLY think about how you want this to turn out. "
4,ag9jwg,t2_154280,8asdqw731,"YTA, giant asshole she's you daughter and you should educate her about dangers on the internet, completely removing her privacy and means of communication is done by controlling narcissists, not worried parents"
4,9xaxrw,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"YTA. They could try to evict you, but it would take time. By then the dog would be safe. I wouldn't be able to live with myself. I'd think about the dog safe and warm and relieved, then tossed right back out like he did something wrong. At the very very least, you could have left him outside one of the rescues that was full. He'd be safe."
4,9xaxrw,t2_hg2dbl2,Theoriginalgw1,"Yes, unfortunately YTA. Which sucks because you tried lots of things on a short timescale. However your always going to be the asshole for leaving it there. A well meaning asshole but an asshole nonetheless Edit:- Also this thread is most fun when there are disagreements/ borderline cases"
4,9xaxrw,t2_10xyw5w,RareRino,"I really don't get everyone calling you an asshole. You did everything you could, but at the end of the day you being able to have a place to live is more important than the dog having a place to live. Of course, getting the dog a home would have been ideal but given your circumstances that would have been impossible. NTA."
4,9xaxrw,t2_11hspx,lunari_moonari,NTA. You did the best you could in your situation and gave it your best. Sometimes things don't work out no matter how hard you try. I don't get everyone calling you an asshole though. Most people wouldn't even have bothered to try and pick up the dog in the first place.
4,apbh9e,t2_jnwts,Bluezephr,"NTA after seeing the edit. This is on your husband to kick them out when they have overstayed their welcome. They are his parents, and if he wants them to be welcome in your home, he needs to tell them when it's time to leave."
4,arywys,t2_25wp3bsh,maybeMathProf,NTA for sure. Your BF is putting enormous strain on his body and mental state. Your are not uptight for (rightfully) worrying about the obvious health hazards involved with this. Your BF is an asshole for not listening to your needs and for not addressing his own health. It is also bad that he is succumbing to peer pressure. This sounds like a challenging situation. I wish the best for the two of you. I hope you will be able to communicate about it.
4,ast2vi,t2_2z5ur1by,blackandwhitepaint,"I was leaning toward YTA for saying something about the past that is unnecessary, but it seems that this was actually something she needed to hear. Maybe not taken to heart, maybe no lesson learned, but she does need to be told to respect someone's no as a no and that her pushiness is not always appreciated. Also, she should have apologized instead of getting defensive. NTA"
4,ab0348,t2_16z5g7,BananaFrappe,"NTA. But you weren't being particularly adult in this situation either. It was rude and inappropriate. Next time, ask the flight attendant to take care of the situation for you. Disciplining other people's children is always problematic."
4,ab0348,t2_wqyn0,cernegiant,"YTA. Don't go around threatening violence no strangers, especially not children. The kid might have been playing a game on the entertainment system and that's what disturbed you. If asking the kid to stop doesn't work, ask his parents."
4,ac9a2p,t2_2mpfcq6a,LadyCass79,NTA While it is nice that you were willing to share food you are not obligated to give anything up that you had a need for. 
4,as2sj3,t2_tcwbi7,brandyto,YTA. You aren’t the only group member who would prefer to be at the gym or having a social life. A group project is a team effort. Team efforts generally require each team member to sacrifice something at some time.
4,as2sj3,t2_15nlh35,TwistedKisses874,"NTA There's nothing unreasonable about telling your group-mates that a certain time no longer works for you. Dig your heels in, stand firm, and tell them that this is a line you aren't going to cross."
4,b4tm8u,t2_2aouv9ge,truemyth11,"YTA for not telling him but that being said, herpes of any variety is extremely common and really isn't as bad as the media makes you think. Watch the Adam Ruins Everything episode about it."
4,aphod9,t2_2qll5xvk,Rogues_Gambit,NTA buuuut I would be very careful if you decide to report them having dogs as this might/probably backfire on you and anyone else that has dogs there
4,aphod9,t2_te8lw,ren1813,"NTA - as long as you have it on paper you're allowed to have dogs, complain and give your reasoning so the landlord knows you're not just being petty and understands your reasoning, add the band practice too and make a case so the landlord can force more appropriate behaviours. "
4,aphod9,t2_1r32flkw,e_61,"NTA, but only because the dogs clearly aren’t being properly cared for. If they were taking them to a dog park or something regularly, training them so they got some mental exercise too, etc., the dogs would be so much happier, quieter, and I’d encourage you to leave them alone."
4,aphod9,t2_2ib590kw,AVerySnaileySnail,"NTA those dogs sound like a nuisance and aren't supposed to be there. Also, you can make noise complaints to the police, who will get them to be quiet"
4,aphod9,t2_6lzgi,Beeb294,"NTA. If tr he dogs are either bothering you consistently, or are not receiving proper care, then informing the authorities in place is not an asshole move. If they weren't bothering you or they were properly cared for, that would be different. Also, not the asshole for making noise complaints. Yes, they pay to live there too, but you also pay to live there and you deserve quiet enjoyment just as much as they do. And if you've asked consistently but they still are bothering you, you aren't an asshole for escalating. "
4,an2oly,t2_2034fhxz,thelongbeachtech,"YTA, just tell him to pound sand and move on dude. No need to further his diseducation by giving him false information. Failures fail, you just don’t need this on your conscience, which it appears to be."
4,age8pg,t2_1sz3j08i,malevitch_square,NTA No one should ever be guilted into participating in religious activities such as prayer when they are not a member of that religion. It's beyond rude and inappropriate of your mother - she is the asshole. As an atheist your beliefs are just as valid and should be respected. 
4,acem4z,t2_doqtb,MadoogsL,NTA You were at work. If she was not at work she can do this herself. It's okay to ask a favor but not okay to get mad when you say no. That's not asking a favor; it's making a demand. Umless I'm misunderstanding something here?
4,awifpp,t2_21t55rvf,Farlyfjord,"NTA/ESH I really admire your gutsy attitude. I wish I was able to be as confrontational as you, amazing. But from a managers perspective, I would hate if some did this to me. But also, I would never be such an ass to just not respond to someone I told was hired. "
4,awifpp,t2_3btakx0q,neckbeard_prolapse,"NTA - Continue contacting him until he admits to it. There exists no way to discourage this terrible behavior, so you're doing your civic duty here. Hopefully this experience will be a good deterrent to prevent him from pulling a stunt like this again. "
4,asuqqz,t2_16ijp6,Northern_dragon,NTA. There is literally always a reason not to break up. Better now than when he is grieving his father or some such. Clearly he is lashing out because he imagined you had no realistic better options or that you just were too scared of being alone. 
4,asuqqz,t2_z5kgr,amy4947,"NTA. Good on you for getting out. Sure, it might be shitty timing, but he's been using you for what seems like a long time. Of course your ex is going to think you're an asshole; he really seems to have nailed the victim mentality. Your relationship had become toxic; you needed to leave. "
4,afdhjq,t2_1lvc81je,P_Flange,NTA. You attempted to go through the proper channels and none of them would acknowledge you. At that point you do what you gotta do.
4,axacqk,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,YTA. Her mom is in town and she doesn't get to see her often. You care more about something you do three nights a week than someone your girlfriend only gets to see twice a year. Your priorities are immature and selfish.
4,axacqk,t2_7za20,Prince-Lee,"YTA. You’re being completely unreasonable. The only way that this would make a remote amount of sense is if you’re in a world-first guild, but I seriously doubt that’s the case. You only see her mom a couple times a year. Missing one raid night is not a big deal. This is childish and you’re in the wrong."
4,axacqk,t2_15pia1,Theroyalzz,"YTA, for someone to come to town twice a year you can’t make an exception for something you do 3 days a week? You are definitely an asshole for that. I’m a huge gamer, but if my SO mother wanted to see me I would choose that out of respect. ESPECIALLY since it’s literally 2 times a year cmon now"
4,b5lqzc,t2_1ykz1ok3,lost-cannuck,"NTA - you talked to her about it a couple times, the landlord spoke to her about it. You could ask your landlord to put up a private parking sign (or assigned to unit ___) Next time she does it, you could put a note on the windshield that if it continues you will have it towed for being on private property... "
4,b5lqzc,t2_2kqzj3jn,feedbacksandwich,NTA. I'm that age and living alone. You are trying to be considerate and she isn't. Parking is so fraught in apartments. It comes up here a bit. Is there any sort of compromise?
4,a1rg3q,t2_u5aij7n,MisterSlosh,"NTA animal abuse is not only a warning sign of serious issues, but also a crime. Next time confiscate the weapon and report it to the police. Minors probably won't get much trouble but at least you can be sure the parents and pet owner get notified."
4,a1rg3q,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,NTA. I would have called the police. I also would have snapped the gun in half. Next time call the police. Little shits picking on something smaller than them. 
4,a1rg3q,t2_d51wt,sowillo,"NTA. some guy in England shot at a baby with an airsoft gun and the baby now has brain damage, breathing problems and is blind and will be in a wheelchair. Dogs have thick skulls but they still couldve hit his eye or gone in a soft spot. Any its still cruelty. You should inform the police or animal protection too. "
4,a1rg3q,t2_25absm1e,boudicas_shield,"I would go even farther than UTA and say NTA. Actions have consequences, and if you abuse animals with your toy, that toy is probably going to get taken away by someone and shattered for good. It’s the least they deserve. "
4,a1rg3q,t2_23v8roj6,360alaska,"NTA: The only kind of kids who take pleasure out of hurting defenceless animals are the ones who grow up to be serial murderers. You may have stopped what they were doing, but you didn't change their attitude or the fact that they don't value that poor dog's existence. "
4,a1rg3q,t2_2jm45gq8,NuclearInitiate,"UTA The better option may have been something like taking the gun, telling the kids to have their parents contact you, and alert the police to animal abuce, for instance. I just worry about breaking someone else's property. That said, I don't know that I would have behaved any differently than you."
4,a1rg3q,t2_2iizrc62,Hawntir,"NTA You let them get away with it once, which is incredibly lucky for them. The second time you protected the victim. I do wish youd videoed it and gotten the cops involved, because fuck these brats. With no witnesses or evidence, you could get in trouble for breaking their property... I hope you do not."
4,a1rg3q,t2_2a1ipgeg,MulysaSemp,"NTA. Looking at it from an outsider's perspective, I'd say it might have been better to confiscate the gun and call the cops. Or at least record it so that the kids can't go back and say you were just being mean to them. But I'm not sure I would have done anything differently in the moment."
4,a1rg3q,t2_m9t5za8,too_tired_for_this8,"NTA, although I don't know if I would've broken it. If there was a clear path to the dog owner's house without enroaching on the dog's territory, I would've handed the gun over to him/her and told them what the kids were doing. That way they could keep an eye out for those kids in the future (in case they decide to downgrade to chucking rocks at the poor creature, etc.)"
4,a1rg3q,t2_8wcahcd,lolo_sequoia,"NTA 💯%!!! I'm sure someone else has said it, but animal abuse as a child is strongly correlated with violence as an adult. I wonder if there's a parent you talk to, unless the kids are getting abused in the home..."
4,a1rg3q,t2_26vtmcnj,KotiKat,"NTA, obviously their parents are doing well enough at teaching.... Must have been a cheap gun to break that easy... If you see it again you should make sure to snap it on a curb or something "
4,a1rg3q,t2_6he2r,Captcha_Imagination,YTA Never disciine kids or animals with emotion. You can just take the gun and tell the parents what happened when they come knocking for it. I hope the you don't run into the dad in the next few weeks.
4,a1rg3q,t2_1bzt458,ST_the_Dragon,"NTA. It may be a legally grey area, but morally you had good reason. (Perhaps you did let your anger get away from you, but you didn't do anything directly to the kids, so I would side with you.)"
4,a1rg3q,t2_16ukg9,Wwwweeeeeeee,"I'm thinking that a call to Animal Control wouldn't be out of order, for them to check on the welfare of the dog. If the owner, tired as he is, can't be bothered to care for and protect the animal, there would certainly be better homes out there for it, and rehoming into a better situation would be a great outcome. And definitely NTA. What are the kids going to tell their parents? 'Yeah, some guy broke our gun because we were torturing a dog with it'. Not a chance.. 'I didn't break it, Bobby broke it!' Bobby says 'I didn't break it, Timmy broke it!' "
4,a1rg3q,t2_1qm2qkr,OnlyKindofaPanda,"ESH. My first thought was ""downvote cus obviously NTA"" but now I'm thinking that OP should have told the owner. Imagine your dog is being tortured by kids while you're away at work, one of your neighbors puts in a half assed attempt to stop it yet never tells you. Obviously those dumbass kids not only need their airsoft gun taken away but needed to be reported to the police, which OP refrained to do as well. "
4,a1rg3q,t2_94sjw,panic_bread,"NTA at all. I would have also told the pet owner and the kids' parents. On second thought, you are the asshole for not doing nearly enough to help the animal. You don't even know for sure that you broke the gun. "
4,a1rg3q,t2_6r80u,Joyrock,"NTA at all. Everyone is saying talk to the parents, but no. This is a situation where you get evidence and call the cops. This is blatant animal abuse and they're old enough to know better. "
4,ap3mh8,t2_savca,Jasminefirefly,"NTA. Not only are you not, he is a control freak who does not respect your privacy. A person is entitled to have private things in their life. If he doesn't understand that, he needs to grow up. I fear this controlling behavior may escalate over time. Consider carefully whether it's really worth it to give yourself to this relationship when he refuses to respect your boundaries. "
4,agme1n,t2_24kstn50,ronronronrow,"NTA, the restaurant should be taking the hit for the spilled drink. It was an accident and that would be the correct customer service to keep both guests happy."
4,b6bse0,t2_7e92e,Thehealeroftri,"NTA and kinda NAH Anyone giving you a glare is definitely an asshole who needs to realize that there are other people in the world other than them. Kind of NAH because a lot of people get caught up in the flow of movement from the crowd and nearly have no choice in the matter. Regardless, you're NTA though."
4,api0aj,t2_2qll5xvk,Rogues_Gambit,NTA I think most places have to give 24 hour notice and to message you at 7.30am they either forgot to ring you or just an asshole either way you shouldn't feel bad
4,a6kf5h,t2_1lvc81je,P_Flange,"NTA. If managers want to cut costs by cutting hours or shifts, then they need to be prepared to step up to the plate and help take on the extra work themselves. If they can't, then that's a pretty big indicator that the shifts can't be cut. As for the staff calling off, that's also stupid management. Need to keep the staff pool healthy enough that if people call in sick they can be replaced within a couple of phone calls. "
