3,a1311q,t2_2kabg9z7,xormun,"Uh absolutely NTA. These are really really horrid behaviors for your partner to display. 1. Says you take everything personally, but takes you saying you don't like your job as an attack on your entire lifestyle with him. 2. Holds things he willingly did with you over your head as if you owe him compensation for his own choices? 3. Brings up your weight as if it has any relationship to the topic at hand. You are an angel and you deserve all of the support in the word. If he withdraws support and affection because you say you aren't happy, that's a really unhealthy (and potentially abusive) relationship. He's asking you to be dependent on him and then shaming you for doing so. If you're unhappy with work (and a call center sounds like it would be, of course) you should try to find something closer to your interests. His job might be ""harder"" but if it's in a field he enjoys and wanted to pursue then it makes a huge difference. In the meantime, you deserve a partner that will listen. If he won't accept your feelings as valid and chooses to attack you for speaking your truth, I think you should consider having a very serious conversation with him. You deserve unconditional love, always."

My girlfriend has hypothyroidism and i know the struggle she goes through dealing with her metabolism, limiting her calories and still dealing with weight gain at times. It’s not your fault. If your boyfriend can’t understand that then I would question whether or not he’s mature enough to be in a committed relationship. I also known the pure and utter fucking misery of working in a call center. That’s a shitty job. I’m now fortunate enough to have my dream job (software engineer) and although it’s much harder overall, it never ever feels that way because I love doing it. Never underestimate the value that loving what you do brings to your ability to power through difficulty and obligation. I would say to OP: - Spend some time thinking about what it is that you could see yourself doing and being happy. We all have to work unfortunately, that’s just life. But that doesn’t mean that we have to hate our jobs. Figure out what that looks like for you and what a first step is towards that journey, and then take it. Don’t do it for your boyfriend, but for you. - if you aren’t already, I would highly encourage you to see a doctor for your thyroid condition. There is medication that Can help regulate your thyroid hormone levels and also control some of the more painful side effects. Prior to getting on her medication, my girlfriend dealt with hair loss, chronic fatigue, nausea, among others. - as for your boyfriend, his behavior sucks right now. He may feel some resentment because in his mind he is contributing more than you are, but to be honest, relationships go like that sometimes. The key thing is support. Do you feel supported by him to take positive steps in your life or do you feel like he criticizes you? The difference between those two will be very telling about the future of your relationship. Ideally, when things are unequal in terms of contributions, the partner that is contributing more is supportive because there is trust that the other person means well and is working towards something better or dealing with something temporary."

She absolutely should have been honest about the money. Her reasons for not being honest are understandable but no excuse. Moving forward, try asking her if there’s anything else she needs to come clean about so you can start over with total honesty. "
3,ax9t4t,t2_4mkmard,DJFloorPancake,"ESH. I was in a very similar situation with a college group project. Myself and two others did the work of a 6 person project. We planned all the meetings, did 90 percent of the research, put together the presentation and each presented our portions really well, but the rest of the presentation was a total mess. After the project was done, the professor asked to meet with me and the other two group leaders to ask what went on. We told her that we had done most of the work, and she gave us A’s while the rest of the group got C’s and D’s depending upon their presentation. Some of them BS’d it really well. The point is, if you’re doing the work and the professor is good at what they do, they’ll notice. I would have reached out to express your frustrations before leaving the rest of the group hanging. "

Catholic school is expensive! Your family is making a huge sacrifice. It's fine to be embarrassed about the smoking, but never, ever, ever be embarrassed about someone working to make money. Reselling merchandise for a profit isn't shady. Be proud of your family and who you are. The other girls at school are assholes, too, and are gonna judge you no matter what you do. "
3,aka65b,t2_ddwro,cashmag3001,"YTA, but not a huge one. It's expected at your age. Your dad is busting his ass to provide a life for you, and sending you to an expensive private school. He cares about his daughter and wants to provide her the best possible opportunities. He sounds like an old-school Vietnamese guy, my guess is either first or second generation American. Your parents sound like the perfect embodiment of the American dream, tbh - to work hard in order to provide a better life for your kids than you had and to pull yourself up by the bootstraps. In the end, the petty drama of being a teenager will mean nothing. Learn to appreciate what you have. They're mostly doing it for you. Who honestly cares what the spoiled daughters of wealthy people think of your family? You'll get a lot further in life by learning the hard-working and frugal values of your parents than by trying to emulate the vanity of your classmates. As far as smoking, your dad works hard, and if he wants to smoke, if that brings him a little sense of satisfaction, he should be entitled to do it. You'll get through it, and be better for it in the end. Teenagers are stupid, so try not to care what they think so much."
3,aka65b,t2_2wmq2tyd,annoyed68,"YTA, but honestly the whole “my parents are the most embarrassing people in the whole world” feeling is pretty common for teens lol. Not to mention (as nicely as possible) you seem like you’re a little sensitive and could use a pick me up in the self esteem department. Now the Craigslist thing- I feel ya OP, I really do, but he’s not selling that stuff for fun- he’s making sure y’all’s bills are paid and there’s food on the table. His smoking is a health hazard and I mean you could talk to him about how it’ll affect him negatively but you shouldn’t focus too much on how your friends view it. Your friends don’t live with him, your friends aren’t paying his bills, and your friends ultimately don’t affect his life. I think you owe your dad an apology. Explain that you’ve been feeling a little overwhelmed at school and you’re finding it a little hard to fit in so you’ve been nit picky with certain things. But you love him and you understand that you hurt his feelings. Best of luck, OP "

I will never get to apologize for being a self centered teen, but you can. Just think about it."
3,a4hfkv,t2_bgum7ty,Belellen,"NTA But if I may inject: maybe she's focusing on using Christmas as a stand in for happiness/family time? Sure, she's put her foot in her mouth by forcing *her* ideas of happiness/family time on to you, just like her parents forced their ideas on to her, rather than learn what *you as an individual* and not her idealised idea of you might like and find some common ground. Maybe when this settles down a bit reinforce that while you hate Christmas you don't hate the idea of spending time with your mum and have some ideas of quality time you could spend with her/the family that you could stand doing. Yeah, I'm asking you to be the parent in this relationship and that's not fair on you but it honestly sounds like she is so caught up in protecting her ideas that she doesn't have emotional space to work it out for herself. It will be better for the relationship in the long run and if it doesn't work then you know you've tried."

I don't think your ex is entitled to dictate your life this far after breaking up, nor the lives of others. He wants to hang out with you and you want to hang out with him. You not seeing her family was a courtesy to her, but at this point if he wants to hang out she should just get over it. edit: to add on, did she make you cut ties because you started dating the new girl?

3,b3hq29,t2_2qs8b59e,sabel418,"NTA. When I got divorced, my brother asked if it was ok if he still talked to my ex husband and occasionally hung out with him. I'd been with my ex for almost a decade at that point and my brother enjoyed having a ""bro"" to commiserate with since I'm his only sibling. I was fine with it, I just didn't want my brother giving my ex husband any information on my life after him. Which he was good with. &#x200B; It didn't last long for him, because my ex just continually bashed me and complained to my brother how I'd ruined his life. My brother at one point stopped him mid sentence as was like ""dude, you do realize that is my SISTER you're talking about, and if I hear one more nasty word about her come out of your mouth, I'm going to kick your ass"". He stopped talking to him after that. Didn't mention the encounter to me for a few years. I gave him the biggest hug for standing up for me. "
3,acq804,t2_qim1c00,bskw_99,"NTA - these are all things, maybe not outing her to her parents, that are very childish of her to react the way she has been. These are not major fight starters and definitely don’t need for her to leave or not speak to you for days. Plus you’ve apologized for the other things and the brownies were a simple mistake. She’s over reacting and especially about things that don’t even include her, like the marathon and your sprained foot. Plus if she smokes anyways, I don’t see why the brownies are a big deal. Side note: I thought the lyrics were cheesy but cute and I would’ve forgiven my bf, but that is just me. "

3,b3hvgo,t2_7iu6cts,WhoryGilmore,"NTA I know reddit tends to side with employees, but I don't think you did anything wrong. The company is probably fine with giving you the parking since they've done it the last 4 years, the employee wouldn't budge and you knew the manager would so you asked to speak to the manager. It doesn't seem like you yelled or anything, and if the employee got into trouble it's probably for not following policy. It seems like a no brainer to extend the parking "
3,b3hvgo,t2_2bp2pwf3,nononoohgodno,"NTA At my current job, when customers get upset about -whatever- and ask for free shit, I apologize for the inconvenience and say some nonsense like “Let me get my manager so we can make this right for you.” This way I don’t get in trouble for handing out stuff I’m not supposed to, and the manager can handle the situation how they best see fit. The counter rep should absolutely not have had a bad attitude with you by being condescending, they could just say “I’m sorry, according to our policies I can’t do that, give me a moment to get the supervisor so we can take care of this situation for you.” Bam, manager (who knows about your arrangement) can take care of, the employee doesn’t get in trouble for being a snotty brat, and everyone wins. "
3,b3hvgo,t2_awff2,CatherineConstance,"YTA - not for asking to speak to the manager but yes for your entitlement. I would absolutely be frustrated too if it had never been an issue for years and suddenly was, but you have to understand that they were doing you a favor and breaking policy for you in the past and now they are following policy. You can't expect every employee to know who you are and it's annoying af when people expect special treatment just because you've gotten it in the past. Also, the employee was right. It doesn't matter how much you spend at the hotel, parking is a separate fee. You can't go to the grocery store and say ""well I spent $25k here last year, so you have to give me that bottle of wine for free!"" It just doesn't work that way. Next time, you should *calmly and kindly* ask to speak to the manager and ask why it is an issue after it hasn't been for years, don't argue with an employee who didn't make the rules and has no idea why a random person would get free parking."

You say you didn't raise your voice, but every word here is through this ""shocked that low level employee didn't know how important you were"" veil.

Oh man, is customer service the funnest job in the world. You all were literally trying to get him to bend the rules, so you all could park past the time allotted without paying. Honestly, if it were me, I'd either say no, just like how he did. Especially since he only got an attitude after you insisted and copped one first. OR. I would have gotten my manager to deal with the entitled customers. SO. KAREN, you can say it's hospitality, and you can speak to your managers, but that doesn't make you not the asshole"

If the kids express interest in wanting to attend church I think letting them go would be nice, but as long as it’s a good church that promotes equality and are good people. I know it’s not ideal because one adult would have to attend at least. But it might be something to bring up to your sister. Some people are calling you the a-hole here, but these are just your conditions and beliefs. Taking on three extra children is hard. Your also being straight up to your sister. You don’t want to lie, you don’t want to risk your family by not being given the correct funds because they don’t trust you. Whatever happens in this situation I hope it works out for you and the children. Goodluck! "
3,ava5fh,t2_5b9z8,altxatu,"NTA: You want to raise these kids no strings attached. That’s more than fair. Bottom line this is about money, and nothing else. That’s okay, kids cost a lot. It’s a reasonable thing to be cautious about. The devil’s in the details, and that’s a lot of money. I’d want that stipulation removed as well. Could you use that money to get them birth control? What if they decide religion doesn’t have a place in their lives? Will that money just vanish since they aren’t being raised “properly?” All that is a hornet’s nest of fucked up legal stuff. I wouldn’t want to deal with that (on top of the other legal stuff it takes to adopt) either. If I were you I’d try to find a way to secure that money for the kids (it’s not only the right and ethical thing to do, but it sounds like you have everything else taken care of anyway). I would happily adopt the kids, and see about getting them grief counseling as well as family therapy for all of you. The idea being that you all seamlessly fit into each other’s lives and any bumps along the way becomes grounds for resentment. If the kids are hyper religious, respect that. Also inform them that you or your family won’t be preached to, talked down to, and you won’t tolerate any bigotry. Lay your ground rules, but allow them to express themselves in their religion. If they want to go to church every Sunday, take’em. If they want to sit at home, eat chocolate frosted sugar bombs, and watch cartoons, that’s fine too. Don’t tell them atheists are respectful and, generally good people. Show them. Prove it day in and day out. Eventually someone will say atheists are terrible and awful, and they’ll say to themselves “wait....OP is an atheist and so is his family. They aren’t like that at all. This guy has no idea what he’s going on about.” "

While Ada could give you guardianship, I don't see how adoption would be possible without a termination of the father's parental rights. Hopefully someone has kept track of the father's shenanigans and there's a paper trail to back it up. With regard to Ada's estate, she could place the funds for the girls in a trust and name an attorney, bank manager, etc. to serve as a trustee (or co-trustees). A monthly stipend to cover living expenses for the kids could be determined with increases over the years as the girls' needs increase. Payment of any educational expenses could be made by people with no skin in the game who know Ada's preferences.

Your attitude towards religion seems like it might be a bit harsh, but as long as you wouldn't forbid her children from being religious you wouldn't be an AH, you don't have to indoctrinate them into a religion just because your sister wants you to, but you also shouldn't prohibit it if her kids want to be religious.

And that is probably equally important to your sister as is religion. Can you meet her halfway in something like maybe ensuring that while you won’t be able to raise them under the same religious expectations she would have had she been alive and parenting them, you can at least ensure they will learn about the religion and they can make their own decision.

The girl was devastated for weeks thinking her father was just in a whole in the ground rotting. DO NOT DO THIS TO THE KIDS just because you hate religion. I can't believe you would allow relatives to end up in the foster system just because you think religion is foolishness and don't want the kids raised that way.

You should also emphasize that if they aren't feeling well or choose not to go, you will not make them go. Then I think you should have asked that she put all the money in a kids care account marked specifically for their education and household expenses, and could not be used for any other purpose.

She can't sign away his parental rights in her will, no matter how much she may want to do so, and therefore you may very well have a huge and expensive court battle ahead of you to keep the kids if you choose to take them.

I'd say she needs to attend some grief counseling and be calmly and respectfully told she is not putting her 100% effort into her current relationship because of her last one.

3,azbqau,t2_tr871,OkCuspids,"YTA. Not for not feeding them - in fact, from your story, there doesn't even seem to be any indication you were even *asked* to feed anyone - but how you handled it. Seriously... you sound like not only an asshole, but some real next-level pretentious classist. They were never in there for food first of all, they just were picking up Chris and wanted to use the bathroom. All they did was comment on the aroma (a comment made by a CHILD), and your mind immediately got all defensive and panicky and jumped to conclusions. If I was just popping in somewhere to use the bathroom and there was a great smell in the air, sure if it was that good I'd probably comment on it. Doesn't mean I'm asking for anything, was probably just saying ""damn, Chris's friend's mom must be a good cook!"" A mere *complement* from a child had you all flustered. Let that sink in for a second. > As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. Again, said by a child, not a parent - probably just telling the parents they want to go home and eat rather than stick around and be chatty. When I was a kid my parents had a tendency to be chatty when we're on our way out from somewhere while I would patiently wait for them to finish. ""Mommy, this smell is making hungry let's go home"". > I diplomatically said that ""well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you"" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. > The father replied ""not really"" and looked away. > I said ""well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry."" and ushered them to the door. This is where your true colors start to show. Literally NO ONE asked you for anything, and you kinda put the parents in an awkward position with that comment when all they were doing was waiting for their kid to finish in the bathroom. > Since then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. Holy shit, THIS is where you sound like a real asshole, adding insult to injury like that when Chris didn't even do anything. Imagine how he would feel when your son tells him that. You ""don't want a repeat of Chris's family on the doorstep""... when all they did was say hello while wait for their kid in the bathroom? Even after Chris has been coming over for a while previously with no trouble whatsoever? Parents come in to say hi sometimes when picking their kid up from a playdate, why shouldn't they? Also, why is 'going to his place' included? Afraid of their family's 'inferiority' and poor-ness 'rubbing off' on your son? Honestly, based on how you constantly describe Chris and his family in this story as being ""poor"" and ""not well off"" several times, it seems like you look down on them and view them as inferior to the point of resentment and repulsion, and the egregious conclusions you jumped to that they were trying to 'mooch' off you just adds to that. Taking all that into account, along with your need to add insult to injury by laying down the law with your asinine restrictions on your son's hangout time with Chris alone, it also seems like their presence in your house *offends* you because of how 'inferior' they are and unworthy of having anything to do with you, much less set foot in the presence of Your Royal High-class-ness, and why it triggered that knee-jerk reaction and assumption. Lucky for you though, if Chris's parents have any self-respect, they probably don't wanna be anywhere near you either after how reprehensibly you treated them. So, congratulations. Seriously how are there so many NTA comments"
3,azbqau,t2_1455et,vero2017,"NTA- It sounds like they heard about your feeding Chris and thought that you would feed the whole family if they just hung out on your doorstep long enough. It is unrealistic for anyone to think that you would have that much prepared food on hand, or could afford to feed them. As to you deciding that you no longer feel like you want to include Chris so frequently in your family dinners, that is your right to make that call. From the information you provided it felt like his family was ready invite themselves for dinner and take advantage of the generosity you have shown their son, when the appropriate thing to do would have been to say Thank You! "
3,azbqau,t2_2frr9t5o,depestoreddit,"NAH - but I think you jumped to conclusions and probably embarrassed the family. They were being nice and complimentary of your home, that's polite. Kids say things all the time that embarrass parents, so the kids said they were hungry, it's not like the parents set him/her up to say that. My kids are very well fed and I could still see them saying something like this because they're kids. More appropriate comments would have been nothing, ""can I grab you a granola bar?"", ""I'm sorry I didn't make extra"", or if you were feeling generous maybe ""I'm sorry I didn't make extra but maybe we can have you guys all over for dinner sometime."" Saying 'I'm sure you have something nice at home' when it sounds like you probably know they didn't likely embarrassed the dad. I think his comment was out of that embarrassment, not a way to get invited to dinner. And then throwing in the takeout comment when that's expensive and you already mentioned they have finance issues feels like kicking them when they're down. Of course, none of us actually know the situation. There are definitely leeches out there. I hope that wasn't the case though and you are able to continue to give Chris a place he feels secure. Out of curiosity, is this a single dad situation? We had a family like that near us when we were growing up. The mom passed away unexpectedly when the kids were little. I think he tried his best but he worked full time and wasn't the best homemaker. The neighborhood kind of half adopted the kids and we all felt pretty good about that. "
3,azbqau,t2_gj2do,epicBaklava,"NTA, I came from a middle class family we had food no problem, but the home life was hell. I spent many weekends at friends houses and was feed. I am older, an adult now, and I look back and think man what a thing to do. These people were richer than us (upper middle - rich) but that doesnt matter. I shouldnt have been their burden on them because my family didnt want to hash out their own problems. Eventually the family owned a business and we would give them products in return.... many years later &#x200B; TL:DR I was chris once, now im an adult, and I see how rude it was of my parents to do that."
3,azbqau,t2_1k94yu2,lovemesomeotterz,"So you're NTA for shooing the family away because that is not your responsibility but YTA for telling your son to hang out with his best friend other places because he's poor. I know you don't want the family showing up but as an adult and a parent, you should just keep putting up with them for your son and keep politely declining if they keep inviting themselves into your home. And please take your judgement. I see everyone else commenting the same things and you keep saying "".....but I don't care if they hang out OTHER places."" No. That's why in this situation YTA and you asked for that judgement. My reasoning: 1) I was the poor kid. My family never did this to someone else but if I knew someone's mom didn't want me at their house because my family was poor and she might have to give me a snack, I'd think she was a total bitch and be shocked. Same if my mom did this to someone else. 2) You're going to regret turning away the opportunity to be the house your kids actually want to hang out at. Trust me, after I decided my friends parents were better to hang around than my parents, my parents begged me to bring my friends around the rest of my childhood - I never did. Maybe because my mom was judgy with my friends and I didn't appreciate it, it made me resentful. 3) You'd rather your kid wander around aimlessly than bring his friend home to the place he feels most safe and comfortable because you're worried that these people who've never showed up before are going to show up again. Seems like you're just being classist at that point. In all, no, you don't have to feed other mouths, you're right and I'm sorry. No, you can't discriminate against your kids best friend for being poor and idc if they have other places to hang out, you're wrong and I'm sorry. "
3,azbqau,t2_2ktm3y26,confusedspeckledcow,"NTA- I get it. I cant afford to feed everyone. But heres an idea. Offer Chris's mom some recipes. Maybe offer to help her find food banks, apply for food stamps. Which barely cover food for a family of 5. Offer to help them find resources. Maybe not monetary help. But help. You might get taken advantage of. But only once. Then end it. The kids where hungry. I would have fed the kids. And I bet Chris was mortified by the interaction as well. Edit to add. I have been so fucking broke I couldn't afford groceries. My husbands job transferred him to a very shitty shop where we made 1/4th of what we where making. But we didnt have the nessicary paperwork to get help. I have called friends for help. And in my better times, friends called me. I have invited whole families of friends of my kids over just because daddy lost his job. I feed people who need food because I have been there. I have bought full on groceries for people I barely talk to anymore. I have split what I had in my pantry. Food shouldnt be a divider. It should bring people together . "
3,azbqau,t2_88g5c,OPtig,"YTA Are you seriously so worked up that poor people came into your house, said it was beautiful and complimented your cooking? Your post is full of disdain and assumptions about their intentions. For all you know, their claim about needing the bathroom was legitimate and you just panicked, assumed they were freeloaders and rudely shoved them out of your home. Now you want to alienate Chris so a poor hungry family doesn't darken your doorstep again. You could definitely stand to humble your attitude."
3,azbqau,t2_4eehcdu,ecstaticegg,YTA Not because you should have fed them. I can see how you wouldn’t want to set a precedent or be taken advantage of. But they must have been desperate to come like that. You knew they couldn’t afford to get food and you suggested take out? Why would you do that? But the real reason YTA is because you told your son not to invite Chris over anymore. Because his family one time implied they needed food from you. That isn’t his fault and you’re an adult. If you’re so selfish that you’d tell your kid to bring his friend over less and you can’t see how that makes you the asshole I don’t know what to tell you. Tell your kid he can bring Chris over as much as he wants. If you can afford it maybe send him home with leftovers sometimes. You aren’t obligated to but if you can afford it I think it would be very kind. If you really want to go the extra mile I would look up nearby churches or charities that provide food and see if you can point them in this family’s direction. Some churches have programs where they deliver groceries to struggling families in a way that won’t publicly be visible so they won’t be embarrassed. Although this family seems beyond that point of desperation. Which should be a red flag for someone who isn’t selfish.
3,azbqau,t2_l48ob,shushupbuttercup,"YTA. Same as all the other YTA votes: not for not feeding them. My perspective is that you're asking your son to push his good friend away because you're afraid that there might be another awkward encounter with the kid's parents. If it happens again, be an adult and be clear with the parents. My parents told me I couldn't go to a certain friend's house anymore because of once incident that wasn't dangerous but they just didn't like, and it totally killed the friendship. To this day, my mom says that she didn't intend for me to not continue the friendship, but that's what happens in this situation. Do you think Chris is gong to ever feel comfortable with your son after you force this issue? He'll feel like you're constantly judging and pitying him because his parents are poor and socially awkward. And your son will never forget that you responded by putting a wedge in his best friendship. "
3,azbqau,t2_1thb2jz8,happydactyl,"YTA for your response, not the broader sentiment. They didn’t ask for food and it wasn’t even the adults who commented on it. They might have been angling but that really wasn’t obvious, at least not from your description. You’re totally NTA for not just randomly feeding a family that showed up at your door - you’re not responsible for the sad situation of people you effectively don’t even know. But making that assumption and the accompanying awkward comments and (especially) telling your son that his friend can’t come around as much/at all makes it a YTA situation. "
3,azbqau,t2_xw5ny,fuzzyoctopus97,"NTA for not really wanting to feed an entire extra family unexpectedly, although no one actually asked to stay so I’m kind of iffy on that, however it’s sounds pretty messed up that you told your kid that his friend couldn’t come over to your house any longer just because of a single incident that he wasn’t even actually a part of. Saying you’d send them along a sandwich if they decided to hang out outside the house is still banning a kid from your house."
3,azbqau,t2_6lzgi,Beeb294,"NTA. There is a discussion here about doing the nice thing if a family is in need, but not going above and beyond doesn't make you an asshole. But if this family is having food security issues, you should try to guide them toward some form of help, or maybe notify the school to see if they have any programs to help out (many schools have a backpack program where they will send some food home over the weekends with kids- pasta, canned goods, etc.) If the school knows this family may be in need of such a program, they can get started with helping this family. "
3,azbqau,t2_4g81x,remedialrob,NTA because it was an awkward situation you didn't really have time to think about but... if your instinct is to protect something so small as a single meal or a bit of food over possibly poor/hungry people then you're not especially generous or giving beyond a certain point either. Which is fine. It speaks to the limits of your character that that is your impulse. But it doesn't make you an asshole. Just not an exceptionally good person. 
3,azbqau,t2_12iwvs,Lion12341,"NTA. It's good manners to offer your guests food, but the rest of his family weren't actually intended to be your guests for that day. The only way they could have eaten in that scenario whilst maintaining some good manners is if you offered them to join you. You didn't really have any obligations to feed them. Try to keep the status quo though. It would be really sad for both Chris and your son if you tried to push them away because of one awkward encounter with Chris' family."
3,azbqau,t2_2pmodwnm,SkyGamer0,"NTA. you dont want to feed an extra 4 mouths in your own home, but i feel like you could have handled it better. Something like ""Hey, im sorry but I didn't cook enough for all of you, because I didn't know you were coming"" Then next time you see chris, say something like ""Hey chris, im sorry but your family isnt able to come out for dinner because I don't have enough time for that but you are able to come over at any time"" its not the greatest but it would work"
3,azbqau,t2_3dyrylw0,GinTrouble,"NTA but possibly about to become YTA I’ve got an Aunt and Uncle like this, except they’re not poor, they’re just cheap. The always rock up at meal times and awkwardly stay and talk about how hungry they are until they get fed. They also remind you that nieces birthday was 2 months ago, and even if you didn’t get her a present that’s fine she’ll be happy with cash, and oh, I see you’ve got the DVD of that show, oh we’ve been wanting to see that desperately, if only we had the DVD like you have... you’ve finished watching it right? And so on and so forth. And it’s all said in suggestions, boxing you in so the only polite response is to give them what they want or seem like a cow (I often seem like a cow). I love them and all, but you can definitely tell when someone is angling for something in a convo, and I’ve no doubt you were right about the family wanting dinner, and well within your right to say no to feeding 4 extra people. HOWEVER Chris is innocent, Chris is in a difficult spot, and the actions you take now can make a huge difference to how his life turns out. Be that third parent, that invisible support for him. You may not be directly responsible for him, but morally he is a child in need, and you have the capacity to help. When I was growing up we frequently had my brothers friends end up living with us for times when their own family situations got rough, and there was always a seat at the table and an extra loaf of bread in the kitchen for any hungry kid to eat without asking. It kept those kids out of trouble and quite frankly stopped any of those kids from dragging my siblings and I into trouble. And a secure older kid will in turn take care of their siblings. So help Chris get through his education by treating him as one of your own with his own place at your table, and you will end up helping his siblings, as well as keeping your own son out of trouble. Plus, it’s the kind thing to do. "
3,azbqau,t2_2hl1gk5x,pacingpilot,"YTA, kinda. You have assumed the worst of this family and the father without any concrete knowledge of what their situation is other than they aren't as well off as you. Your son obviously has a strong friendship with Chris so would it really be a major inconvenience to get know his family a little if for no other reason than to better understand the dynamics of a child your own child spends so much time with? Maybe the dad sucks, I dunno. Maybe they are good people in a bad spot and you'd be able to help them...not with food from your own pantry but maybe by guiding them to community resources that can better help them. Of course you are under no obligation to help them but would it be the worst if you made an attempt to find out a little more about this family and if circumstances allowed, give them a little help or guidance? It could all start with an invitation to dinner, a ""hey, our kids spend so much time together, I'd like to get to know your family a little if that's okay?"" ""Be kinder than necessary, everyone is fighting some kind of battle"" - J.M. Barry"
3,azbqau,t2_3dhafzng,Clair-with-an-e,"YTA it sounds like you are having panic attacks because he has a friend whose family picked him up once. All we know is someone complimented your food and you felt on the spot/obligated. I dont really think anyone did anything wrong. It sounds like for once the ""working family"" is jealous of the good mother. > they can hang out at the library Wow your kid wont have many friends if he cant hang out in a convenient location after school. He will be the loner kid in highschool because not a single person with a social life hangs out at the library. Where is dad in all this? I like how you are so afraid of the world you are ruining your kids friendships."
3,azbqau,t2_7cq49,lampishthing,"Saying yes to Chris: Good person points. Saying no to second kid: NTA Saying no to whole family: for sure NTA Saying that Chris shouldn't come around? YTA You don't have to feed Chris when he comes around but if you are helping out a kid in need and it's no serious imposition on you then why don't you just reap the good karma and feel good about it? I realise this way of thinking isn't super popular in the states but in my opinion if it doesn't hurt you to be selfless you should do so, regardless of whether it lets some asshole off the hook. The parents are the assholes, not Chris, and he now gets punished for it. They probably only came around cos he's been openly grateful about your cooking at his home."
3,azbqau,t2_2qra170e,honeymilkteas,"NTA for sending the family away, you didn't have enough food and they turned up unannounced. However, I think you're the a-hole a bit for not wanting Chris at the house much anymore because of a one time event, and you could always have them wait outside for Chris."
3,azbqau,t2_2s78v15z,bapadious,"NTA I think you handled the situation beautifully. I think they were testing the waters, to see if you were going to invite them to eat. But they now know that you have no intention of extending an invite. I doubt they will try that last minute guilt trip shit on you again. And you already are going above and beyond, feeding your son's friend. A lot of parents would send their kids friends on their way, before sitting down to a family meal. "
3,azbqau,t2_nzxwl,LindsayQ,"NTA. You prepared a meal for X amount of people, not 4 extra. Hell, a while ago I visited my parents without calling first (they live near the cinema so after I see a movie I just pop in and say hi) and my mom was cooking. And she said ""you should have told me you were coming, now I don't have enough for all three of us"". And you know what? She was right. I was not offended. I shrugged and went home. I'm a grownup, I wasn't planning on staying for dinner and I don't expect her to give me her food. Also, a few years ago a good friend of me and my sister had a hard time at home, coming out of the closet to Christian parents and all, so he would come over on Friday night and occasionally stay for dinner. Eventually he dropped by Every. Friday. Afternoon. For dinner. This lasted about four years. So once you invite them over for dinner, they'll just keep coming. Sounds harsh, but it really limits your freedom that day. "
3,azbqau,t2_uu8a7iv,Jb2head,"NTA. My guess is that Chris probably talks about how the food you make is awesome or at least implies that he’s already eaten. And like leaving a bowl out for the neighborhood cat, the rest of his family are trying to get a piece of the action. That is VERY trashy, and rude of them. I don’t agree with the tell your son to stop having Chris over part, your home sounds like a safe place for him. But, I understand wanting to not have his family pull a guilt trip on you. "
3,azbqau,t2_28rylpsp,Quick_Temperature,"YTA. This is for one simple reason you are punishing your son and chris becuse of the familly. There is no need to stop him coming over, if his familly did it again you could talk it out with the farther but from the sounds of it I dought it will be a common occurrence as there plan just failed so miserably. I think your NTA on how you acted on the day its self, what they did was rude and a obvious plan to get some food. I dissagree with people who said the ""take out it is"" comment was classist, it was the least awkward thing to say after that."
3,azbqau,t2_3t2qd2x,bindhast,"There is a cultural component to this . In India, YTA for sure. Food is shared and liberally. The way I imagine the scenario playing out in India is - the host *insisting* that they stay for dinner. And then, the two moms scuttling to the kitchen , with one serving to the families and the other making something else quickly to accommodate more mouths. Sending some one out hungry at dinner time would be... unimaginable. Related but not really- when we would travel in train and had brought in packed lunch , you would offer the people sitting next to you as you had your own. At times- offer them first before you have it yourself. "
3,azbqau,t2_27ofar51,TheNightmanCometh462,"YTA. Hungry people came to your house, one of them is a friend of your son. You could have fed them but decided not to and then took steps to ensure that their son is no longer welcome at your house because he’s hungry. How dare he be a hungry child in your presence?! When he grows up he could’ve had an amazing story about his friend’s house where he could get a good meal when his family was going through some hard financial times and he was going hungry often. Now he will have a story about feeling like a burden on some lady because he was hungry and that his family was sent away hungry and disinvited from going back to his “friend’s” house afterwards... because he was guilty of being hungry. Things you could’ve done instead: 1- fed them all and made them feel welcome 2- made some more food to ensure everyone could eat, get to know them better. 3- give them some money for take out or groceries. 4- order food in or have it delivered to their house. 5- discuss with their parents about if they’re having financial difficulties and see if you can help them find a job or point them in the direction of resources to help them get food. We had a house in our town where kids knew they could go if they were hungry. My buddy’s mom would feed anyone and everyone who walked through their door. They were not rich (far from it) and they had 6 boys of their own on a $30,000 a year salary. But she ALWAYS fed every single person who stopped by. Dozens of kids have grown up with nothing but fond memories of this house and the love and kindness they felt there. There are very few worse things I can think of that we can do to our fellow beings than sending them away hungry. Especially if you have more than enough. To top it off, ensuring that their son is no longer welcome at your house in order to prevent you from feeling put out again just makes me cringe. Disgusting behavior. I hope you’re never in a position like they are now, but maybe then you’d learn something. But I doubt it. You are definitely the ass hole. I hope your kids grow up to treat others better than their mom does. I’d be ashamed of my mother if she did this. "
3,azbqau,t2_7v4z9,tygaismydog,YWBTA. So I was leaning in on nta because it’s not your job nor responsibility to feed Chris. However you will be the asshole if you push him away from your sons life. Even small things like not having him for dinner are going to make him feel uncomfortable towards you. You’re not an asshole for not feeding him but you are an asshole for pushing them out of the house. If I where you I would invite Chris over for dinner while he’s hanging out with your son. To be honest based on your replies I think you’re a bit paranoid. Unless this has happened multiple times I doubt the dad will be back tbh. And if I recall correctly it wasn’t even the dad that asked for food. He obviously was embarrassed as well because he looked away. NTA for not feeding YWBTA If you mess up your kids friendship. 
3,azbqau,t2_yvq2f,Red_Rocket_Rider,"NTA for not wanting to feed the family, but kinda YTA for not wanting your son to bring Chris home, especially that's one of the only ways for him to get a proper meal. My step mom has 3 kids in the same age range too and the second oldest also has a poorer friend that spends most of his time at their place and I always found it comendable that she fed him too, as if he was her own son. Although it's not your duty to feed Chris, I do think it would be the right thing to do"
3,azbqau,t2_dkkce,poltyy,"NTA But I don’t think you’re a great person either, it’s not great behavior. What you’re doing to Chris is deeply unkind, although you really have no obligation to him or his family. You have a chance to change a kid’s life by modeling a stable family home, good nutrition, and kindness. Instead you’re distancing him so that you don’t have to possibly experience an uncomfortable moment with his parents. You’re a grown up, you have the mental wherewithal to BE uncomfortable, resolve situations in a responsible manner, and come to terms with situations instead of avoiding them. You’re supposed to be able to use that to teach the next generation how to adult. And instead you are teaching your own child, who I guarantee knows what is going on, poor adult behavior and nothing about conflict resolution."

3,b67ghb,t2_g7knv1f,jolie178923-15423435,"I think YTA but only mildly so (because I think everyone understands wanting to look good at work and advance). yes, your son won't remember it, but it's also his first birthday party. It's not unreasonable of your wife to want you to let your boss know this is a prior engagement that you can't miss. also, this part honestly rubs me the wrong way a little bit: >Frankly I feel like this party is for her rather than my son. Shown only more so by the fact that the overwhelming majority of the people invited are her side of the family and her girlfriends. If it was truly for my son, who will have no memories of this event, then surely the other side of his family would have been given more thought. so...get involved and talk to your wife about the guest list? You have agency and two hands, text your family and friends and invite them? is your wife *refusing* to allow you to invite your side of the family, or...? **Edit:** and I agree with people who point out that dropping something as important as your son's first birthday party to fill a shift at work might not make you look like a great candidate for advancement - rather, it might end up just making you look like a pushover, a patsy. Now that kind of thing is obviously highly dependent on the unique interpersonal dynamics of your workplace, and it may *not* be the case here - but I've seen situations like yours play out like that.

The fact that your wife can’t see the bigger picture and the implications of your actions beyond this one party is unfair. Also, I don’t know why everyone keeps stressing FAMILY FIRST as if that’s always right. It’s not. You have to take each decision as it comes and this is a fair one to deliberate. It’s potentially a chance to show your work you are enthusiastic, dedicated, and reliable...and that means a fucking lot! It gives you more grounds to ask for a raise or set your own path etc etc....Sorry reddit, work matters and family can’t trump work 100 percent of the time. 😬 Your wife enjoys the benefits of you working (paycheck to live) so she should fully support you keeping that part of your life as healthy as possible...because none of you can eat if you don’t! Within reason of course!!!! Also, you’re still showing up to the party, just a bit later. She can still have her all day party and mingle all she wants without you there; why does she care if you come later? You guys don’t need to change the party time to accommodate your work. Try to get her to express what she REALLY WANTS out of this party. I’m pretty sure your presence is lower in the totem pole than just having a successful party. I can relate to your wife because I get attached to a thing I want to do too and get mad about plans changing. The changing of plans ALWAYS BOTHERS ME. But I’ve learned over time that it just adds stress and unhappiness and there is no reason to be attached to things happening a certain way sooooooo much that it’s going to ruin my mood all day. Just roll with the punches man. I struggle to keep this perspective but when I do, my life is a lot easier. "
3,b67ghb,t2_9n8ju,GingerZarah,"NTA You are totally right in saying the party is not for your son. First birthdays are totally for the parents, yay this fragile tiny life with suicidal tendencies has lived thru the first year! That being said I do think you would regret missing the party. There will be other opportunities to show your boss your commitment to your job, but you wont ever get another first birthday. "
3,b67ghb,t2_3f8j5gww,kittykatband,"NTA. I understand family comes first and you obviously won't get fired for not showing up on a requested day off; but your wife needs to understand that if you go, you can support your family more. You want to further your career and everyone knows first birthdays are just for the parents to show off. The people saying you're TA are mostly likely college students who've never worked or privileged people who can switch careers like nothing. They don't understand that you ""sacrificing"" the first few hours of your kids birthday (who won't remember) will pay off down the road when you are making more money and can afford more for your family. "

Missing important events in your family's life won't move you up the corporate ladder, it'll just tell your boss he can get you to cover anything he needs.

They're just bonding over their anger for you, and that comment is just the hill they want to die on. I'm sorry your friend group fell apart and I'm sorry your buddy chose them over you. That's a shitty thing to go through for anyone. The only thing you can really do is let it go and move on. At least now you know who they are. And good god are they a lot of drama.

Encourage your friend to tell her mother about it. Talk to a trusted adult about it. But your friend likely needs support. And that’s okay to be there for her. I was 17 and in a relationship with a much older man. I look back on that relationship with disgust. I was taken advantage of. I wasn’t old enough to consent. I didn’t know any better. But he should have. When you are 31 you are in a VERY different place in life than a 17 y/o. They can have a shot at it when a 14 year age gap isn’t such a significant developmental gap. "
3,an6bw0,t2_a7rap,MadtownMaven,"NTA - The gals seemed to have made assumptions that it would be only women in the room. If that was a deal breaker for them, they should have confirmed it prior to committing. The husband staying is a non-issue. That's just not appropriate for what is a school related conference. If they want to get a free mini-vacation out of it, they should put up for a hotel room on their own dime. A fellow student (even if not in the exact same cohort) who is attending the conference for the purpose of the conference definitely outranks a spouse who will not be attending the conference. (Like seriously, what would the hubby be doing while you were all at the conference?)"
3,an6bw0,t2_vqrr6,TheMaStif,"NTA Although you should probably have told the ladies, when you agreed for them to stay in your room, that you had also invited men to stay there as well, just so they would be aware of it ahead of time. But they shouldn't have assumed that was the case, and they certainly have no right to complain, given this is YOUR room and you're simply extending a courtesy. If anything, I would even go as far as saying you have the right to tell Debby and Claire that THEY need to find other accommodations since Eric and Frank have no problems with sharing the room, it's Claire and Debbie who are causing trouble, and whoever sleeps in your room is entirely for YOU to decide, for any reason whatsoever"
3,an6bw0,t2_2xffqing,strawberrypockystix,"NTA. You were trying to be nice and now suddenly everyone is making demands? Abby’s husband doesn’t need to go to the conference. Don’t know why she’s even angry. The women are not being asked to share beds with the men. If they were, maybe it’d be a different story. Personally, as a woman, I have no problems staying in a mixed room. However, I’m used to this as I’ve stayed in mixed room hostels before. I can see why it could be a big deal for someone who has never done it before, but still, that’s not really your problem."

Seems like you are the most mature out of the bunch, and it is okay for a woman to not want to stay with a man out of comfortability, but to assume that you held those values because of an isolated incident (you telling Brent he cant come, which had nothing to do with him having a penis) is foolish on them."
3,an6bw0,t2_4jqq0,madevilfish,"NTA- No good deed goes unpunished. Perhaps you should have made it clear in the group message that you would have the room would be first, for your cohort only and unisex. And whatever spots were not filled up by the cohort would go to other people aka Frank. (But you wouldn't have known that anyway.) It sounds like Debby and Claire need to relax about the room being coed. You're all in grad school, not middle school. It's not going to be a fuck fest in there. (Even if conferences get crazy.) I can see why Abby would be upset but it's stupid of her to assume her husband could tag along. And why as a married couple would you want to share a room with four other people? "
3,an6bw0,t2_x896fls,longtimelondoner,"YTA to me. You should have made it clear who you were giving rooms to upfront, i.e. cohort only but unisex. I wouldn’t want to stay in a room with members of the opposite sex and would have assumed the same as the two women once you’d vetoed the husband staying. I can also understand why that lady is annoyed when you’re letting two other guys stay but not her husband. Especially when one isn’t in the same cohort. "
3,an6bw0,t2_j1pq8,CatalinaBigPaws,"NAH. You did something with the best intentions but just wasn't clear enough. I would apologize for the lack of clarity and reiterate to Abby that her husband is in an unrelated field and that's all you can do. I think you have to resind your offer to the men with an open explanation. As they were planning to stay in a hostel prior, they should be fine. Plus the women contacted you first. Props to you for trying to help you fellow students, things just get messy sometimes."

I would report her to the manager - have him/her watch the interaction from out of view (all without mentioning you speak Korean) and when she pulls it again, if the manager doesn't do anything, tell them both in Korean you are no longer comfortable shopping there, and will be sure to mention the reason why to friends and family."

The fact that she's assuming you can't understand her based on your looks is both stupid and hilarious. That fact that you happen to be Korean is irrelevant; lots of people speak second (and third and fourth) languages. &#x200B; >but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. Not your problem. She did you wrong, you're within your rights to let management know. If you go pushing for her to be fired over something so trivial, you're the asshole. It doesn't sound like you're not going to do more than notify them of the problem though. If they choose to fire her based on solely this, that may make them the assholes, but is not your problem. For all you know she's been a problem employee for a long time and you'll give them the excuse to do what they've already been wanting to do based on all sorts of other shit she's doing. If this is her only issue if they're good people they'll talk to her about it and resolve the issue between them. The even more likely scenario is they'll tell you ""we'll look into it"" and absolutely nothing will happen beyond that. &#x200B; All of the above is not your problem though. If you go looking to put your nose into the specific manner in which they deal with their employee (fire her, don't fire her, train her with this specific program, etc), that's not your business, and you're the asshole. If you just let them know about the problem and let them handle it from there, you're not doing anything wrong. &#x200B; Edit: typos."

The consequences of her awful behaviour are on her. &#x200B; Alternate plan includes waiting till she does it again, and then just responding in fluent Korean ""Yeah, I might be fighting you over $.50, but you're the one who can't get your prices right."" Think of something more witty and cutting than that. "
3,b6kwb4,t2_202ja20u,kellie0105,"I guess NTA if you’re really offended and upset. Yta if you don’t really care. I mean personally I would feel she’s an asshole and I would shrug and move on. Be sorry for whoever she marries. I like to say, not your circus, not your monkeys. I do like some of the other ideas to troll her and hint to her that you fully understand what she’s saying. Sometimes people get carried away and need a reality check. As a former cashier, I would comment on certain customers later on with my coworkers/family and laugh/complain about stuff they would do. I’m sure lots of us vent that way about stuff that occurs at our jobs, just maybe she needs to be reminded to do it while customers aren’t around. "

After confirming it he apologized and comped the meals. You don't need to tell her manager, just talk to her in Korean. Let her know it's rude to talk shit, or just cuss her out."
3,b6kwb4,t2_uz0po,BeckyDaTechie,"NTA, but YWBTA **if** you don't try talking to her about it first. I'm not sure if there's a cultural reason people finding out you can understand them in Korean is a bad thing or not, but I'm whiter than the background on this page and know enough Spanish to get myself in trouble, so I've been there. (Also at a cash register incidentally enough.) A simple statement in Korean the next time you're at the register either 1) thanking her for not being catty *this time* or 2) letting her know you've understood it all the entire time and don't want to risk her getting fired if you tell her manager she's being such a brat at her till may do the trick. She's presumably, if not an adult, at least old enough to shut her damn mouth without much prompting. She should have the chance to make the mature decision before you risk a firing it sounds like she might roundly deserve. The kind thing to do is give her a chance to make the right decision. "
3,b6kwb4,t2_x6cdp1k,SquirrelGirlVA,"NTA. No matter what language they're using, it's never OK to talk about customers like that in front of them. Heck, it's not good to talk like that in front of a person period. I'll give people a pass on things they say when the person isn't around when it comes to work as I know that sometimes it's just blowing off steam, but it's generally not a great idea to do it all the time since it can lead to toxic behaviors. "
3,b6kwb4,t2_3hoidy9o,laufran,"NTA - Another option would be to leave a bad Yelp review of the place. That way your hands are clean if she gets fired, but you'll also help other people avoid the place, especially if word gets out that they discriminate. She said things that were pretty racist, and being Korean doesn't give her the right to cuss Japanese people any more than in she was white. Its probably a family run place anyway, and your complaint probably won't do much good."
3,avujoj,t2_7sapg,thefray777,"NTA We all have things that come up, but someone who is constantly cancelling on others at the last minute is just being inconsiderate. Your timing sucked, but given her long and repeated history of doing this, it's perfectly reasonable for you to have assumed she was just being a flake like always. Next time, ask why they flaked before piling on so you don't look like an ass. Then do the positive sandwich so they'll take it better. A rough example: ""I value your friendship and love hanging out with you. When you cancel plans at the last minute I feel disrespected (etc.) [End with something positive]"" The positive sandwich technique isn't guaranteed to work, but it tends to work a lot better than just giving criticism without any positives. People are less likely to be offended and more likely to actually listen to the feedback and take it to heart."
3,avujoj,t2_28dk2fkj,Delanes_Brain,"NTA: If it was a one time thing sure, understandable. But communication is key and her doing this multiple times without any word or explanation as to why she decided just not to show is really unfair to you. You had no idea what was going on with her (if there actually is or its just an excuse) because she isn't communicating those things to you. Can't be a mind reader."
3,avujoj,t2_12202f,peanutbuttershrooms,"NTA - even if someone in her family died she could probably shoot you a text mid cry. My BFs cousin is super bad about that. We have him over for dinner every Friday (and sometimes Saturday) night. Sometimes he'll just fall asleep and not show up or take 3 hours longer to get to our house (5 min. away) and not say shit about it then come over and smoke our weed and take our dabs. It's really not cool. Especially because it's happened before, theres really no way you're the asshole. She just sucks. Even if she has super bad anxiety or something she could at least make up other excuses beforehand to not come over. There's really no excuse for ghosting or not communicating with someone you made plans with."
3,b01xst,t2_20izeepz,annizoli,"NTA She was probably expecting you to flounder and then she’d swoop in and make it better. You really surprised her by opening up and making friends with her friends, and she’s a bit thrown by it. Whether she’s being malicious or just doesn’t know how to deal with the complete 180 of her expectation I’m not entirely sure, but she handled it poorly enough to warrant a NTA instead of NAH."
3,b01xst,t2_i5du4,Perthcrossfitter,"NTA ! Was in a similar situation with my now wife when we were younger, where she encouraged me to be more social. The only difference in my story is that she was happy for me when her friends enjoyed my company - which is exactly what I would expect of a partner who wants you to succeed social and break out of their shell. Good on you for breaking out of your comfort zone. Also, TIL Urban exploration is a thing."
3,b01xst,t2_2krlgsu2,Ebox3rchamp,"NTA sounds like immaturity on her part. U didn’t do a darn thing wrong. She will get over it, and if she’s doesn’t and this happens again u two need to have a serious talk about making and KEEPING joint friends and going out together.

3,b01xst,t2_3qij4,whooyeah,"NTA In my day we just got drunk and made obnoxious fools of ourselves.Kids of today are so complex.Sounds like it worked out for you and congrats on that small victory.You did nothing wrong.Sound like your GF may be more insecure in other ways. Next time maybe make it about her. Do you read philosophy? I think you would enjoy reading about Jean Paul Sartre and his idea that we all have a problem where we can never be for other people who we are (or think we are) for ourselves. And there is an eternal agony and anxiety in trying to figure out how to achieve this.Another guy Emmanuel Levinas proposed combating this by first showing complements observations and asking questions of other people and they will reflect that good wished back on you like a mirror. I once dated a girl whose father was a famous director and mother was a famous actress. I ended up at a dinner at their house where the table was full of celebrities and I was an early 20s nobody. But her mother introduced me as this up and coming dj who was doing amazing things on the music scene. Through the night people asked me what music I loved and why, and they appreciated my answers with what could only be honest enthusiasm. I realised that they really appreciated each other, for their art and the beautiful things that made them human. I had always noticed that this girl would always ask people a question and was interested like a person who had been without water for a week and the next thing out of that person's mouth would be flow of cool water. People were magnetically drawn to her. She didn't have to say anything profound, amazingly funny or witty. But she made people feel good. The easy fix for you is next time ask someone in the group if they like something your gf is good at or even just into. Then go on how you were amazed at her natural skill level. Or maybe just bring up conversation topics she is into. I'm sure you can both shine."
3,b01xst,t2_2bn9nezk,hazelchicken,"**NTA** congrats man, sounds like you had a great night :) just because they are her friends doesn't mean that she needs to be the star of the show. it sucks being pushed out of a conversation, but... sometimes that just happens, especially when you're quiet. Its the one event, if it were every time you went out that'd be a different story. To feel a little sad is ok but if she is actually blaming you for just something to utterly normal... shes not right. You tried to bring her in, which is all you can do. Conversations can go quickly, to quickly to always ""hold the door open"", and you can only bump the door open for someone - they also need to wedge it over with their own foot in order to come on. "
3,b01xst,t2_2ytgt21z,IMNOTDEFENSIVE,"NTA It seems to me that she's dating you BECAUSE you have anxiety. It sucks that people glorify mental illness, but many people want someone who they feel bad for, because it makes them seem like a better person then they really are. They want the reassurance of knowing their partner is not as social as them and therefore, will not be able to find anyone better, or find friends. Think about it, if you have friends that means she gets less attention. I have social anxiety too, and it's very clear that this is abuse. If she loved you, she would encourage you to be the best version of yourself. Instead, she wants you to be quiet enough so that you are dependent on her. In order to do this, she makes you feel as if you have done something wrong socially because she KNOWS it will hurt you and push you back into isolation. I had a friend of mine who did this, she would look at me as if I was talking too much and would criticize anything I said because she was afraid I was getting too much attention. She went on to spread rumors about me that I ""wasn't really shy"" because in her mind, if I was shy, I could never contribute to a conversation as much as she did. She was only friends with me because she wanted friends who accepted her as the dominant ""Regina George"" ""above everyone else"" type-girl. That ended up pushing me into the worst isolation I've ever been in in my life, I spent my last 3 years of high school sitting alone and not talking or engaging with anyone. That was exactly what she wanted, and it messed me up so much I needed therapy. I felt my opinions were not wanted. And even now, I'm in college, have new friends and a job that I love, but I am still constantly worried that people dont like me."
3,b01xst,t2_107mub,ScarletFeverOrYellow,"NTA She's being narcissistic. Most people would be ecstatic that their partner is getting along so well with their friends (especially if the partner is so introverted). Also, consider this: does she tell you that you're a 'social neanderthal' or is that something you tell yourself? It's not a positive-sounding phrase, and it sounds like you're happy to talk when you're interested and feel comfortable."
3,b01xst,t2_2xl5x45g,Trivial_Punishment,"NTA. The ""Spotlight""?? You're out with her friends, why does she need to be in ""the spotlight"". It sounds as though you got on well with them which is, presumably, what she wanted. I would say well done for going out of your comfort zone and managing to find a common ground to bond with them over. You've spoken about how you don't trust your own social etiquette but it sounds like she has her own problems with it. "
3,b01xst,t2_126jimbk,Hangry_Squirrel,"NTA. I would have been so proud of you. You did nothing wrong and you shouldn't feel reluctant to go to other meet-ups. But perhaps you could join some groups centered around your own interests and go without her. The nice thing about meeting strangers is that they don't know you're supposed to be ""a social Neanderthal"" and you can try on a more social self when around them. Also, based on your account here, it doesn't sound like you don't understand social etiquette. I wonder how you developed some of these ideas: has someone told you repeatedly you're socially inadequate? were you always around idiots who thought making small talk was the epitome of socialization? have you ever had a friend with whom you could talk for hours? I used to think I was charmless and introverted because I'd never enjoyed large gatherings and the sort of pointless chatter which dominates them. Now I can do it easily if necessary, but it bores me to death. However, at some point, I realized I was very good at talking to people one-on-one, including those who didn't normally communicate much, and that I could keep a conversation going with anyone. I still think of myself as being closer to the introverted end of the spectrum, but I don't see it as a bad thing: I choose my social encounters carefully and don't waste energy on those I know I don't personally enjoy. I'll be honest: I don't like your girlfriend's reaction. I don't like the fact that maybe she uses you to feel good about herself and that she resented you for having a successful evening. I don't like the way she made it all about herself, when she should have been glad to see you come out of your shell and make a good impression on other people she likes. This deserves a conversation, but not one in which you're endlessly apologizing just to appease her."
3,b01xst,t2_16j6xvs1,musicalphoenix10,"NTA. She is just upset that, for a night, you were able to be engaged with a group of people when usually it is her bringing you out of your shell. The sudden shift, because of an interesting topic for you, might have been a shock to her and made her jealous that you were able to have a discussion with friends she could not. That doesn't give her the right though to then say you one-upped her, that's just being selfish. Instead she should be proud that you were able to be yourself. Maybe there were social cues you missed that irritated her more, but that seems like something she would be able to recognize as a missed social cue rather than you trying to alienate her since you are dating."
3,b01xst,t2_26i4uwz3,KombatKrazy,"NTA - And... what in the hell. Man now she really messed with your head. In a relationship there is no ""spotlight stealing or overshadowing"". Maybe you should let her know that her ""pep talk"" really helped and you were only chiming in on a topic you really enjoy and are passionate about. She shouldn't feel that way and she should be more encouraging/supportive of the evening. She should've just shrugged it off as a win for you, her and her friends. You finally got to be you and now she's taking that away from you. She made it about her when she shut down, not your fault."
3,b01xst,t2_16zzh67m,mcgar1,"NTA was the intent for the outing for everyone to have a good time with good conversation or for certain people to be in the ‘spotlight’. Her intentions toward this gathering sound like no one was going to be the winner unless she somehow was the center of attention while not having much of interest to contribute. 🤷‍♀️ I’m not saying this small argument is something to break a relationship but it does indicate that she’s possibly immature, has little self awareness, and isn’t one to support others. I would take it as a red flag and be on the look out for more of those flags. Don’t tie yourself down to someone that isn’t interested in evolving. "
3,b01xst,t2_2crjxyo9,smellygymbag,"Nta, i think.. Its possible she was sort of counting your meekness to keep her feeling better about herself. but i have a feeling us commenters would have had to have been there to really see you in action to see if you did possibly inadvertently ""take over"" even if it was welcome by others in the convo. I would have gone with INFO but the info id want would be more specifics of what upset her, which im guessing you dont have. I give her the benefit of the doubt, and leave the door open to the possibility you might have screwed up, mostly because some introverts can be socially awkward, or off putting in subtle ways, maybe just because of a lack of practice. She might also just have had an overly negative response because she wasnt ready for the social energy you brought since you say shes an introvert too. Id just try to talk it out with her."
3,b01xst,t2_1kvh347u,Balla1928Aus,"NTA. I quite often get called a “quiet person” and have felt that some (definitely not most) people start to expect that of you and begin to dominate all conversations. Most of the time that is fine, but on rare occasions when I do have a lot to say, they can have difficulty sitting back and letting me rave on. Maybe your girl was going through this but still she shouldn’t pout. Next time you’re all together they’ll probably be talking about entirely different things and you will end up being more in the background. "
3,b01xst,t2_2wmq2tyd,annoyed68,"NTA She’s throwing a tantrum because deep down, though she’s been outwardly encouraging you, she now feels threatened to see you actually doing better. It’s a power trip for her to know that you don’t do as well as her in a social environment. I’m not saying she’s doing it maliciously but I do think she views you a little as her “pet project” and she’s gotten used to the way the relationship is with her being the “outgoing” one. This is one of those things you’re gonna have to talk with her about and let her know that you will be growing and trying new things and she can’t act like this every time the attention isn’t on her. Best of luck, OP"

I've been encouraging my boyfriend to be more social and to come out of his shell, and there is literally no situation where I'd be bothered by him actually doing it. Any success for him is a success for me, too. I don't think she's necessarily one of those people that wants to come off as some sort of saint for dating someone that's a bit of a project, but she's definitely the asshole on this situation. I would suggest you talk with her and find out why she feels overshadowed. It could be an ongoing thing for her and that night just happened to be the tipping point (making it a forgivable offense), or it could be that she's actually kind of a dick and you'd be better off re-entering the dating scene. "
3,b01xst,t2_7yzqdg4,ImAtW0rkBr0,"NTA. You did nothing wrong, she's pusher her insecurities off on you and making you feel like a Jerk. In reality she prefers to be the center of attention and when that's taken away she doesn't know what to do with herself. IMO she should have been happy for you and proud of you for overcoming your social anxiety. I think you should sit her down and ask her why she feels the way she does and what she realistically expected you to do when her friends began conversing with you."
3,b01xst,t2_11lidu,IndigoKitti79,"NTA, and time to really take a hard look at your relationship. Does she love you, or does she love caring for you? It sounds like she expected awkward moments where she'd have to cover for you (and shine to the crowd as the caring girlfriend), and that she'd have to reassure you after the fact, further cementing herself as ""the one"" who cares. I may be completely wrong, but her reaction is completely off base and is exactly what has me thinking in this direction. Also, your social and anxiety issues sound like something you might want to take to therapy. You may just have generalized anxiety, but some of your social issues sound like possible Asperger's. There is no shame in looking into these things, and it may just be helpful overall."
3,b01xst,t2_2wwbyf7z,luceringuera,"NTA- How awesome for you! You did great! A partner who doesn't support another partner when they thrive will only hold you back. She wanted to bring her quiet boyfriend to be in the background not the super charismatic guy who ever one wants to know. Careful, have a serious talk about your dynamic alone and as a couple in the real world."
3,b01xst,t2_12gmqj,Dogzillas_Mom,"NTA. You didn't do anything wrong. She's been loving this whole ""my BF is socially awkward"" thing because it focuses the attention on her. Because you felt comfortable in this situation and engaged socially (sounds like you were delightful and now I want your number too!), now she feels insecure. Maybe she's been feeling a bit superior to you or she has broken bird syndrome (where she wants to fix other people's flaws to avoid working on her own). "
3,b01xst,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"NTA What. The. Fuck. She convinced you to overcome your social anxiety and meet your friends. She was supportive. And then when you got there, you made connections and had a great conversation. Everyone loved you. So she's jealous and spiteful? That is petty, immature, and manipulative. She's acting like a child. And making your anxiety worse. She needs to apologize or you're never going out with her and a group again, and that's on her. "
3,b01xst,t2_2uhsibx4,PhoebeReeves25,"NTA. She sounds a little narcissistic if I'm honest. Like she enjoys the fact that you're introverted because it means she always gets the spotlight, and so was upset when you actually got a word in. If this was a healthy relationship she should have been proud or at least pleased for you that you made friends and stuff. Not upset."
3,b01xst,t2_13i4kv,ltfsufhrip,"NTA you got a ""life of the party"" moment because you met some people you jelled with and they loved to hear your input! Don't apologize for that or feel bad. She should be happy for you or proud that her boyfriend took a major step forward and was great in a social situation. Very selfish of your GF, and quite frankly just unreasonable in general. "
3,b01xst,t2_37ul1n1p,Budsygus,"NTA She's moving the goal posts. She set an expectation and when you met that expectation she changed it. She's almost certainly not doing this on purpose, but it's not fair to you at all. You had a good time and didn't mean to eclipse her. While you aren't in the wrong here, you can still make some changes to smooth things over: 1) Don't let talking about your passions take over the conversation (I'm super guilty of this and my wife has to rein me in all the time). 2) Recognize when you've been talking for a while then let someone else take over. 3) Most importantly do more asking than you do talking. I learned this when I had to attend networking events for work. I hated them until I realized I don't actually need to talk in order to make a good impression. People love talking about themselves and if you ask good questions they will love you for it. ""What do you do? Oh, cool! How did you get into that?"" Boom, they're spilling their life story and you're actively listening (eye contact, nodding, etc.) right along. By the end of their story you know enough about them to ask a followup question. Bonus is it's easier to give GF more attention if you're in question-asking mode so she doesn't feel left out. ""Hey, don't you know someone who does that? Who was that?"" and boom she's in the conversation. From one asocial introvert to another, you can get VERY good at these situations if you do some reading and get some practice. I figured it out and so can you."
3,b01xst,t2_a6l77wk,99Orange,"NTA - What?! My first instinct is to say your gf is a petty little bitch, but because I like to give people the benefit of the doubt I thought about it further. Maybe the reason she enjoys the relationship is because she appreciates the dynamic of you being the quiet introvert which allows her to shine. She, being an introvert herself, may feel like it makes her seem more outgoing when with someone much more introverted and because you finally found a situation in which you came out of your shell, she in turn felt like she then came off as the anxiety ridden introvert she’s been trying not to be. Regardless, this is her problem, not yours. She needs to recognize that the emotions she felt have to do with her own self esteem and you aren’t responsible for making her feel bad. Bottom line, you should never have to hold yourself back to make someone else feel more confident. Next time she leaves a social gathering feeling bad about herself she needs to look in the mirror and figure out how to navigate that rather than pointing the finger at you. You did nothing wrong. As a fellow social Neanderthal I commend you for finding the courage to join in the conversation. Your gf needs to learn how to support you in this rather than hold you back. My husband encourages me to be more outgoing as any partner should. "
3,b01xst,t2_5td54,LilyOfTheBurbs,"NTA 100% how is she gonna encourage you to open up and be a bit more social then get upset when the you do? its ridiculous. you did nothing wrong. i'm glad you felt comfy enough to talk, sorry you had to deal with her being upset about it. don't let her get you down, you did nothing wrong!"

This woman may have either subconsciously or knowingly chosen you as a spouse because you're quiet and socially anxious because she expected to constantly overshadow you and from the sounds of it, liked things that way, major abuser move, major red flag. Well done for opening up, I know how hard that is, don't let her hold you back but instead remember how that made you feel, being a proper established part of the conversation, having people be interested in you, hold onto that and roll with it and turn social butterfly like I did."
3,b01xst,t2_1gzr8acd,TXperson,"NTA, if my partner did this great while having anxiety I would be celebrating and excited that they’re doing well. Relationships aren’t competitions with winners and losers and having to live in each other’s shadows. They’re partnerships and your success should’ve been her success too but she got mad and accused you of overshadowing her. It’s not cute and it’s really sad. Be with someone who will be proud that you stepped out of your shell, not someone who is going to push you back in when things don’t go her way"
3,b01xst,t2_zj4m3,A_Redheads_Ramblings,NTA &#x200B; You did nothing wrong. She on the other hand is most definitely in the wrong. &#x200B; Seriously? She asks you to be more social and you comply for her to get in a snit that you were being social and engaging in the conversation. What the hell? It's like she can't bear for it not to be always about her. Which is a serious red flag if you ask me. &#x200B; I'm going to take a stab and ask is she an only child? Or the only girl in the family? Cause it sounds very much the behavior of someone who's always been the only/special one for most of their childhood. And could be hiding other more concerning behavior. &#x200B; I would suggest taking a good long look at her and your relationship to see if there's other issues that could become massive problems down the line. &#x200B; Also good for you for trying to be more open to social experiences. Sounds like you had a nice time before her pouting gave you doubts.
3,b01xst,t2_1w9kwc3z,DeathMyBride,"NTA. That was shitty of her and you didn’t “overshadow” her. If she actually cares about your happiness and growth she should be stoked that you came out of your shell. I’d be petty and group text the friends and her, apologizing profusely for “dominating the conversation as you have since learned it was totally rude of you and you’re still working on being comfortable in social situations. You got excited and overzealous and you hope you haven’t offended them.” Then watch her squirm when they say they were happy to get to know you and that you did nothing wrong. "
3,aby8kd,t2_58eiela,does_taxes,"Obvious NTA you aren't obligated to place anyone, much less someone who already made you look bad.

3,a95aw2,t2_2mpfcq6a,LadyCass79,"YTA It's time to grow up. You're focusing on making excuses and lying to family about a difference in personal values and religious beliefs. An adult gets to make their own decisions about these things and can be candid about it. They have a right to not approve, but not a right to make you or him participate in uncomfortable situations to appease them. By doing this how you did, you set up this situation. You should have a conversation with your parents about your life choice and set boundaries firmly. The fact that you can't just say ""Oh, he changed his mind"" and be confident that they will accept the answer tells me it's more emotionally charged than it should be. "

He was kind of douchey, but not a bad guy (just sort of a white knight type but he was mostly okay) so I felt bad saying anything, but same as you, other people were talking about it behind his back. So one day he came in, and since he was the type who wanted to impress woman and liked to make sure he was being ""masculine"", I said: ""Hey X, did you just come from the gym? You smell a little sweaty! Maybe I'm just noticing it because of the close quarters in here, but if you have any deodorant you might want to throw some on!"" He did have some and put it on and that was the end of it, it wasn't a big deal at all."
3,b0kall,t2_i5rrl,lyingtattooist,NTA how old are you two? Leaving a wet towel on the floor is way more of an issue than eating a pancake with his hands. Adults pick up after themselves.

Not an excuse for the weird mom reaction either way, was just curious"
3,b0kall,t2_zyu17,Toastwaffler,"NTA, assuming there was syrup or grease something on the pancake, dry pancakes aren’t that messy so I’d give him a bit more wriggle room.

3,b0kall,t2_1sjue2ue,TheLadyDanielle,NTA He's right your aren't his mother but he's forcing you to treat him as such by acting like a child. I'm curious how old you two are and if he still has some growing up to do or if this is now a long ingrained pattern of behavior. I would sit down with him and tell him that it bothers you that he calls you his mother because you are being put in a position to act that way. Set some boundaries or rules for the house and if you can't agree it might be time to not live together anymore.
3,b0kall,t2_303gyila,misanthropichell,"Honestly, if he washed his hands after eating I don't see anything wrong with that.

3,b5lqc1,t2_38thcz5y,dollbeb,"it seems like I'm the minority on this, but YTA. It's not really possible to be friends with both Jon and May.

Even if it's not forever, I would step away from the friendship for a while."
3,b5lqc1,t2_1ssiyc84,knharp,"NTA but you keeping a friendship with John will probably put a strain on your relationship with your wife, and probably end any friendship you have with May.

He also does some part time work to supplement his account, which she might consider. Anyway, the reason this works for us is I really just let him spend that money on whatever crazy thing he wants and I look the other way entirely, and that's what I'd recommend you do too. So you think $200 leggings are a waste fine, but do you have other hobbies/projects you spend on? I bet you wouldn't like her hyper-analyzing your spending. Or is this money taking away from some greater goal, like paying off debt, that you'd like to get on the same page about?

This is where being nonconfrontational can hurt yourself and the people around you. It was easy to joke with him about sex knowing he actually wanted to have sex with you, because it made him happy thinking he had a chance so you didn't have to be upfront and possibly be involved in conflict.

Terminating a pregnancy affects women and men differently, and neither one can really put themselves in the other person’s shoes here. It’s a highly emotional situation, but still needed to be discussed rationally - which doesn’t appear to have been the case, so I’m not surprised it blew up. While his feelings do matter, he should of been more supportive and (both of you) should have waited for things to cool down before making a final decision on your relationship - you both went through a major trauma, with you having to shoulder the hardest part. Your fluctuating emotional state should have been taken into account. Highly emotional situations are a breeding ground for volatile outcomes, and issuing demands/ultimatums when everyone’s mental state is being severely stressed is never a good idea. Ultimatums should be a last-ditch effort, used only after all other options are exhausted, and have been thought through very carefully. You also have to be prepared for the person to make the less desirable option when given one as well. "
3,acci3e,t2_sz7im,alphakari,"NTA but probably a lot of less than favorable, but probably innocent, decisions made. To start with I think it's worth mentioning that unwanted pregnancies generally produce tragic situations, and that it probably wasn't anyone's fault that it blew up. It's basically ending up needing to make decisions the relationship hasn't been aged to withstand as a rare consequence of wanting to have your cake and eat it too (ie: have sex, but not get pregnant.) **I don't think you should hold yourself, or him, at fault for everything blowing up on something like that. It's sorta like if an earthquake hit while you were both building a house.** On the subject of ultimatums: Personally, I interpret ultimatums as someone trying to leverage my desire to maintain the integrity of the relationship for short term gain, generally without appreciation for the long term cost. It's the type of thing that feels dramatic and like standing up for yourself rhetorically but in practice poisons future conflicts, and in essence attempts to yank out from your partner an admission that they care about the relationship more than you care about it, when that calculus, counterintuitively, is not conducive to having relationships people want to preserve. The integrity of the relationship is a large part of what makes conflicts able to be rolled out to a healthy conclusion, and bringing its stability into the conflict can be incestuous. "

Don’t let your guilt over his mom dying make you overcompensate and ignore this. But give him the devices. “I’ll make you a deal, you can have your laptop back if you stay off those boards”. Call a shrink today and I mean today. You’re going to need his cooperation here so be prepared to give a little (laptop). If he’s on the boards again, put the hammer down.

Taking away his electronics was the right thing to do, though probably not breaking them. I'd have pulled the hard drive and hidden it somewhere until he earned it back.

However, if I called my father a beta male and said very insensitive stuff about his wife dying at 15... he’d probably commit a felony beating my ass. The important thing is this kid definitely needs help. There is a good chance you read people saying that and think that, I’m some way, makes you a failure as a father. Simply put, it doesn’t. You’re not a professional, no parent is. You can be loving and nurturing and kind all you want but sometimes a therapist is the best thing. This is in no way a negative reflection on you. In fact, I would even say it may be good for all of you to go to a few sessions. Your family has been thru one of the worst things imaginable. It’s ok to ask for help. "
3,9ypl3q,t2_pglbz,AMHousewife,"NTA - I have three sons. I have told every one of them that if there are problems, the privacy is limited. Even the best of teenagers do things and hide things from their parents. It's a natural part of separating from your parents that can go well or it can go poorly.

In this case, he's acting like a beast and as a parent that means you have to step in and parent. It looks to this parent that he's angry about his mother's death which is a normal reaction. You throw in all that teenage testosterone and trying to navigate their social world, trying so hard to form some kind of identity, and you've got your son who is reactionary about girls and women, placing men on some kind of hierarchy. So while destroying the computer may also have been grief on your part, you better believe my kid would have no to very limited access to the internet had I found what you found. Hell, right now my youngest son is grounded off of computer because he can't seem to do his homework with the lure of Fortnite. Apologize for your emotional reaction and show him vulnerability. DO NOT apologize for removing his access to that material and that avenue for him to act out. It's absolutely unacceptable. He's going to be very angry with you....so? As long as he's not destructive, let him. Next up? Time to get your kid to a therapist. Get family therapy. Everything he's displaying is incredibly worrisome. He needs some guidance that you may not be able to fully provide."

There is no shame in protecting their self-worth, self-respect, your families emotional well-being and the obvious boundaries in any family relationship not to mention the need to discover when a child is headed down a dark path or is showing hidden mental instability....nobody else will do it for you...and obviously you have discovered your child cannot be trusted to hold steady. It happens all the time. In my household we have an open electronics policy. That is the true test of trust. There is nothing I don't know about my entire families social media, and the same goes for me. It's the only way to be. If your loved ones won't let you go thru their phone or their computer then they are hiding something from you. Totally unacceptable in today's predatory world where the most egregious of horrors can invade your inner sanctum via the internet, twisting young minds. I have been where you are. My child was selling heroin via his computer and phone to the neighborhood kids. I thought he was just popular. He was 13 years old. I found his stash of money under his bed one day. A shit load of bucks. I knew it wasn't from mowing grass, so I went thru his computer. Figured it out pretty quick. If I didn't put the hammer down, and put it down hard...my son would have ended up living a life of crime, in jail or worse. I didn't smash his electronics, I completely removed all electronics from our home. I was the only person who had a phone. He went back to the stone age. He hated my guts, made our lives miserable for a few years. But with therapy, new friends, lots of extracurricular activities, a tutor, and patience..God the patience...he has become a person to be proud of. And yes, he eventually earned the PRIVILEGED of using a computer and having a phone again. As a father, you must stand your ground. You cannot change his thought process, it is learned from his internet use and the people he associates with. He needs intensive therapy (yes, I would suggest a male), new and a better quality of friends, more involvement from you as a role model...and no access to any electronics without your ass being right next to him. And no, he does not NEED a phone. No gaming either. Discover your neighborhood library instead. Good Luck! &#x200B; &#x200B;"

It actually brought us closer because I didn’t want to give him a reason to snoop around. (Eh sounds bad when i type this?) Your son needs professional help. You definitely need to talk with him and get him into therapy ASAP. His behavior is really scary based on your story. He’s going through a lot and he’s also in that phase where he wants to rebel. Be firm but also don’t be too cold towards him. Show him some love since you are the only parent left (sorry for your lost) I think you acknowledging his behavior as odd and seeking help are the first steps towards him getting better.

Don't cede your role of parenting fully while you have your chance to help your child develop into a healthy member of society.

You owe him a huge apology and it will take time for that respect to grow back, but you need to work on it. Id literally sit down and tell him you fucked up. School punishment should have been adequate in my opinion. Theres no point in punishing him twice. During school hours he should be revising or doing work at home but thats it.

That awful hoodie was something he loved that reminded him of good times. Yes I pretty much guided him into wearing a nice peacoat in cold weather and we've slowly upgraded his wardrobe over 4 years. He doesn't wear the hoodie anymore, really but a lot of her old bs clothes remain (Adidas sliders OMG) and he wears them. But! That's him. That's just what he wears and if it bothers me so much I want to ruin or hide his clothes it might be time to leave the relationship. I sleep with a baby blanket as well. Juvenile and embarrassing and unhealthy but it's an anxiety reliever and it doesn't hurt anyone. Everybody is gonna have something mildly fucked up about them and u can choose to roll with it and hope you can slowly guide them out (two God damn years of that college hoodie and it took a full year just to convince him to buy new Adidas slides because the other ones were falling apart and smelly) of whatever it is, upgrade it (with their support and permission), or just accept and move on.

You're intentions don't matter excluding literally immediate life and death situations e.g car keys from a drunk driver. You don't get to control what she wears, you can politely voice an opinion but even that is a stretch if you do it a lot. Don't sneakily fuck around with peoples ""comfort items"". In quotes, because most people have something illogical, be it an item or routine that brings them comfort or security. if it's something you have to confront because it effects you, you have to do so directly not trick, steal, break, sabotage, hide etc. Having a comfort item to this extent is unusual.

They won't let anybody come into your room then, and will be escorted out if they refuse to leave. Harsh, I know. But they're not respecting your wishes. If your mom blows up after that, then just let her be pissed. Nothing gives her the right to basically shove herself into anything important for the both of you. Also, your uncle should not have brought this up to your mom. Maybe he genuinely didn't know that he shouldn't have told her.

Honestly just an awful situation for everyone. Is there any possibility he could just be gone for like two days? Make as small of a window as possible? Land, go to ceremony, and immediately fly back? Labor isn’t usually instantaneous, so it would have to be some really awful luck for two days to make a difference. Good luck, OP, this is a hard one. But definitely NTA!"
3,b6mjur,t2_4fxjp,luvsaredditor,"NTA. I hate that people feel entitled to demand a gift from someone as quid pro quo for attendance at their wedding. If the couple invites you, it should be because they want you to be a participant in their special day, not as a gift grab. It's a courtesy to give a gift, but even for those applying the logic of guests somehow being obligated to repay the equivalent of their food and entertainment shouldn't apply when you're spending more than your cost of dinner to attend. I don't care about the downvotes, this greedy expectation culture needs to die. A gift isn't truly a gift if it's extorted by social pressure. "

Apparently your shitty mom, according to her! Get a sitter. Getting one vetted through a friend or some site is worth the extra money, if you lay out guidelines for what your son is able to eat, and they follow it. Look into afterschool programs if you have that option. Your mother is a total fucking narcissist if she thinks she can have control over him like that. I have 2 autistic kids. When they were little, they had issues with food. It wasn't even fucking allergies, yet I took that shit seriously, and made 2 or sometimes 3 separate meals at at time, because I cooked for my then husband also. I didn't bitch about it, it was something I did, because you DON'T FUCK WITH CHILDREN AND FOOD. NEVER APOLOGIZE. Tell your mom that until she apologizes for trying to force son to eat things that make him ill, she can pound sand. No pediatrician or child therapist or specialist would EVER advise feeding children allergens just because they only get 'a LITTLE sick' If she can't even bother to make him a sandwich or a salad at least, she can go fuck off, there are lots of foods that while they don't actually qualify as meals, can keep him filled until you can go get him. She's fucking awful. I bet if you end up in therapy and examine your past with her, it will come up as her being controlling, abusive and sociopathic, and not just 'strict'. Good on you for encouraging your son to enforce his boundaries. Allergies change over time, sometimes at random. I became allergic to shellfish OUT OF NOWHERE. One night I was eating and my fucking throat started closing up, didn't know why, but it was terrifying. There were no shrimp in the food I was eating.

Nope, NTA."

That said... you might need to look for a backup babysitter. 
3,atvjvo,t2_2456rp3y,EsthieBestie986,"NTA! Good for you for teaching your son that he has agency because a lot of children are taught that they can't say no to an adult in any circumstance. Because you've got his back on this one, he'll know that in the future that you'll stand up for him when some asshole says ""oh, it's fine you can eat what the other kids are eating,"" and that can help to prevent a more serious reaction down the road. It's not that he just didn't like the food that was served, it could have caused him real discomfort! She's not putting as much weight on that as she should. You're mom is totally the asshole right now. "

It doesn’t matter if it’s not one of his deadly allergies. Most allergies will escalate in intensity with increased exposure, so the danger is always there. All that aside, you have taught him he is allowed to refuse things he’s allergic to, YOU are his mom and he’s doing exactly what he’s been taught by you. You’re doing a great job backing him up and honestly, I’d put my mom in a timeout over this, and I’d find an alternative care situation for kiddo. It’s your mom who owes you and your son an apology.

As someone with a ton of allergies, the idea that a family member would willingly put me though that discomfort makes me rage for your kid. Good on you for teaching him that not only is he allowed to protect himself but he is 100% allowed to say no to an adult if they are doing something that will hurt him. I wish I had that lesson earlier in life. Unsolicited advice: Easiest fix, if you want to continue to have her watch him: provide a meal for him when he visits her. It shows him that he did nothing wrong. However she may take it as a lack of trust so be careful how you offer this. Personal feelings on this: She is a selfish bitch and is saying her need for convenience is more important than making sure he is comfortable and not hurting. Not only as his caregiver but as his friggin grandmother... come on lady. ""fine as long as he has antihistamines if he gets hives."" < - that genuinely made me livid. That's your family, how the fuck are you gonna treat them like that? I'd ask her if she would be pissed if you forced her to eat something that you both knew she was allergic to because ""oh you can just take a pill to ease the discomfort"".

His mother began laying into me, saying it wasn't nice for me to tell that story. It wasn't, but it was desperation, and she could've easily seen that. I told her to talk to the wall, I wasn't going to take her lecture.

3,atvjvo,t2_376xvame,Canoe-Maker,"NTA I cannot express with words how frustrating your mother is. She endangered the health and well-being of your son and when he rightfully stood up for himself she lost her mind. She is so much in the wrong here, you are not the problem. The only thing I can possibly think of that gives you any fault is that from the brief paragraph you gave us, it sounds like you didn’t inform your mother about the allergy. I have food allergies and intolerances myself, and when something makes me sick I’m not going to eat it, period. Maybe have your son articulate that it was an allergy thing, but only because he’s five and honestly if someone tells you they won’t eat something as an adult or really anyone who is mentally capable of knowing what they can and can’t handle, they should be believed and respected enough not to have ppl try to force feed them. Sorry for the rant, but I wanted to stress that you and your son are not the problem here. The idea that the kid should apologize for looking after his own well-being is ridiculous. "
3,atvjvo,t2_x6cdp1k,SquirrelGirlVA,"NTA, neither you nor your child. See, the thing about allergies is that they can change. For example, I'm HIGHLY allergic to dairy, but my reaction more resembles someone with dairy intolerance. I've been warned by multiple physicians and nurses that my reactions can change over time, especially as a body's biology changes over time. (IE, puberty, pregnancy, surgeries, etc) That means that at some point in the future my allergic reaction could change from intestinal issues to hives and anaphylactic shock. I've had anaphylactic reactions show up as a reaction to some of my other allergies and it's not fun. Shooting yourself up with an Epi-Pen is painful, scary, and you will shake for hours afterwards while your body processes the adrenaline. Still, it's better than, y'know, not breathing. This is no different for your child and I'd honestly say that if he's *ALREADY* experiencing hives and an itchy mouth that he's far more at danger of having anaphylactic shock start appearing as an allergic reaction. I'm sorry, but your mother is a complete and total stupid fucking idiot for playing around with your son's allergies like this and getting upset that he won't put himself in harm's way because she wants to do the whole ""clean plate club"" thing. She could be awesome otherwise, but for this she deserves to have someone smack the back of her head. Seriously, I can't stress enough that seemingly benign allergies can turn life threatening and that they should not be taken lightly by anyone, especially a family member. "
3,atvjvo,t2_2sv5vr25,_JustSayin,"NTA You decide what's best for your son, if anything she should apologise for trying to force your son to eat something that could give him hives! P.S.

Authoritarian bullshit had its place to get kids through the Great Depression alive, was used as a shortcut after that, and has no place in functional families today. We know more about allergies, change in palate, nutrition, even genetics to make this kind of bullshit acceptable anymore. Cilantro tastes like soap to you? That’s actually genetic, not a kid who is a “fussy eater” or is “just looking for attention” or any of the other bullshit excuses. And it’s really easy to just cook around them. Because kids still need proper nutrition. No longer in the “don’t eat what few veggies we can find or afford and you’ll get a deficiency disease” way that the World War Era grew up with and scared their kids with, though. Allergies are no joke. And eating things you hate doesn’t make you a better person. "
3,atvjvo,t2_2vsqmcmz,MissPlumador,Nta kid needs to learn he can say no to foods. Sounds really unconfortablecto me.

3,atvjvo,t2_2frr9t5o,depestoreddit,"NTA. Whoa! Does she also make him shake the snotty hand of a person who has a cold because, yah no, there are cold remedies? Kids with food allergies, especially away just age 5, can't always distinguish between, this is what kills me and this is what just sucks. Also, they tend to be naturally more afraid of food, because you should be afraid of things that try to kill you too! It's a good survival instinct for them. Assuming he's generally a polite kid relative to his age, then no. Sounds like an appropriate reaction to me. The only thing is I generally don't advocate ""breaking up"" with family members unless it's severely justified. Only you can be the judge of that, so it would be helpful to figure out how the two of you can get past this. "
3,atvjvo,t2_257eypcu,ilyriaa,"NTA! Omg. My mother would never see my kid again for purposely trying to expose him. Allergic reactions can worsen after exposure, and just because his reactions have been “minor,” doesn’t mean it won’t suddenly be serious next time. And good for your son for standing up for his safety! That must have been very difficult to do, especially to someone who should have his best interests in mind. "

Wtf is wrong with him eating a sandwich or something? I applaud your outlook and how you are parenting your son with respect and empathy. Smh I really can't wrap my head around people who treat children and their adult children in that way. You can't even be yourself as you say. My therapist recommended ""walking on eggshells.""

If I go to a friend's house or whatever, I don't eat food with wheat in it. I cannot be the AH for choosing to not make myself uncomfortable for the sake of other people's comfort. The only difference here is that he's a kid, and your mom apparently thinks that gives her the right to control his body in this way.

That was the last time she got to have her granddaughter over unsupervised."

I make the choice to eat it or not, and sometimes if shrimp smells a little too shrimpy, I pass. This is my own choice because I don’t want to have hives if I can avoid it. It is ridiculous that your mom tried to force this issue. That is not okay. The only (not acceptable but maybe understandable) reason for your mom’s behavior is that she forgot he was allergic to this, and then was embarrassed and made it a manners thing, even though she was clearly in the wrong."

You should be proud of that boy for standing up for himself, and make sure that he knows that his grandmother was completely in the wrong for trying to feed him what he shouldn’t eat and punishing him, I know it’s difficult for some kids to do that and it’s good that he did."

However, no one can or will ever force me into it if I don’t want it. Your son is a vulnerable young child. You’re absolutely right to back him up on this. And you’re absolutely right to be teaching him right now to avoid all allergens. As I’m sure you know, repeated exposure can turn a mild allergy into a severe one. Your son should never be pressured into eating food he’s allergic to, or punished for not eating it. Your mom sounds like a real piece of work. Sounds like you’ve taught your son well, having him defend himself like that. I would’ve folded like a wet blanket at his age. Keep on being the great mom you are, OP. "
3,atvjvo,t2_hm4jd1q,Plzspeaksoftly,NTA eating food that you are mildly allergic to can cause your body to react in different ways such as a brain tumor. My friend is mildly allergic to chocolate and he breaks out in hives. But he loves chocolate so he kept eating it and took and antihistamines. He developed a brain tumor because of it. Your mom's an ass. I would have a talk with her about feeding him foods that he is allergic to even mildly. 
3,atvjvo,t2_2zmxdhw,notreallylucy,"NTA. your mom needs to get more educated about allergies. They can escalate over time. Allergies that ""just"" cause hives where the patient keeps getting exposed can progress to anaphylaxis. Your son had 100% the right response to stand up for himself, and you were right not to make him apologize. If possible, you should make an appointment with an allergist and bring your mom along so she can hear from the doctor how she's making your kid sicker. "
3,atvjvo,t2_dkkce,poltyy,"NTA I know you love your mother, but I think you need to call her on her bluff. Reinforce with your son that he is not to ingest allergens and that grandma is wrong. I don’t want to fear monger, but there are TONS of stories on r/justnomil where the mother or MIL just could never admit fault and always had to be right to the point where they’ve hospitalized (and in one case killed a kid) because they could not accept the allergies. I guarantee that the next time kid is there she tries to force him to eat the same meal in a power play. Please cross post over there, because I think this is above AITA’s paygrade."
3,atvjvo,t2_14c7i4,Asmodean129,"NTA. If your mother is anything like my mother (older generation, bit naive to things, etc) then it is likely she doesn't understand allergies properly. If he has eaten the food in the past with you, why can't he eat the food for her? That's what she would be thinking. And as a parent of an allergy prone kid, you should probably avoid that food altogether in case his allergy gets worse. Out of interest, have you taken him to an allergy specialist? Might be discomfort and hives today, but there is no need to make it an EpiPen incident tomorrow"
3,atvjvo,t2_2wj6ad2v,JWJulie,"NTA - though I would use the opportunity to talk to your son about how he needs to speak to adults, because in future (at school, etc) he needs to be able to get people on his side rather than giving attitude. For religious reasons we don’t take part in various activities and my daughter from a young age has had to be able to explain herself to adults at school. If he comes across as being belligerent he will only make things harder for himself as he is less likely to be believed. Then have a chat with your mum and tell her that you have written a helpful list to aid her memory on which foods you don’t want your son having so that this incident never, ever, happens again. "
3,atvjvo,t2_mnexo,jokerkat,"NTAs - Shame on your mother! He shouldn't have to go through extreme discomfort because she is too lazy to cook a meal free of his allergens for him. This is a hill to die on. She doesn't get to make him poison himself just because she is the adult. There can be permanent damage and escalation of the allergy when repeatedly exposed to minor allergens. Tell her that, and that she apologizes for trying to force him to eat what is literal poison to him and risk making his allergy much worse, or she'll see neither of you again until she does. You are better off without her if she can't follow your parenting rules about your son. She's treading in JustNo territory. Head on over to r/JUSTNOMIL and r/JUSTNOFAMILY to see how to set boundaries and enforce them with consequences. I'd also maybe check out r/raisedbynarcissists to see if she is part of that territory and how to handle it. Many narcs get called ""strict"", when really they are being narcy. It'll help you determine what was actually strict and what was her being controlling, manipulative, and was due to her need to always be right. "
3,atvjvo,t2_4jpid,MsKim,"NTA Your mom is an idiot and I wouldnt let her watch her grandson anymore. You never want to give a kid a food he is ""a little allergic to"" without supervision by a doctor (sometimes doctors will try treatments that include giving the allergic person a little of something they are allergic to but in this scenario the doctor has PALS training and epi on hand) because he can go from hives and a small rash to his throat closing up and dying pretty quickly.

3,atvjvo,t2_1gj1dsw9,SeaOkra,"NTA I have a quite mild allergy to onions, cooked ones or food cooked with them will leave my skin super itchy, but its no huge deal. (well, mostly. scratching myself bloody isn't nice, but if I have a tylenol and an antihistamine, I can endure mild exposures.) On the other hand, last time I bit into raw onion (I didn't know it was in my food) I had a pretty scary reaction to it. Gasping for air, drinking a bottle of liquid benadryl while being rushed to the hospital, it was scary. And scarier still was the time before that I got raw onion in my system? I itched a bit and got a headache. Not sure what flipped, but raw onion is now treated much more carefully around me. My grandmother (who loves onions) won't even cut them if I'm in her house and has eliminated them from recipes for my safety, and she is not an indulgent person, she's one of the strict ""do as I say!"" types. Thing is, a mild allergy at any time could get worse, and if I understand correctly, children with allergies are even more likely to have a sudden change in their reactions. How would grandma feel if her insistence on making him eat his allergen was ""the one"" to push him over into a serious allergy? I think your mom needs to think that over pretty carefully. I'm an adult, I choose to be a bit lackluster with my allergies. Your kiddo is a kid and deserves the people in his circle's protection against danger, whether it seems ""mild"" or not. I have to say, if I were his mom I'd be pretty proud he held firm and didn't take the risk. And anyway, what sort of ass backwards logic is it to intentionally make a kid itch and suffer because you don't want to omit an ingredient or make something else?"
3,atvjvo,t2_2b3c42ct,goldenbellaboo,"NTA at all! I didn’t develop allergies until my early teens, but my brother has had nut allergies pretty much his whole life. As a kid he would refuse food even with the nuts he wasn’t allergic to and nobody would ever give him a problem. They SUCK, even the allergies that just do give you discomfort. Good for you for teaching your son about his allergies. He should ALWAYS put his health over manners. "
3,atvjvo,t2_dqfvxm7,Kazubla,"NTA WTF?! She knowingly gives him food that he's going to have an allergic reaction to. This brings me back to my childhood where my mum would force me to do yard work knowing I have hay fever and refusing to buy any antihistamines with the excuse that ""I'll build tolerance over it eventually""."
3,atvjvo,t2_4n2hv87,MrsJuliaGhoulia,"NTA. At ALL. Good for you and for him. Hopefully your mama will come around because while it might not kill him, it's fucked up that she would even WANT him to eat something that triggers an allergy (and also don't allergies sometimes go from not serious to quite serious with multiple exposures?)"
3,atvjvo,t2_1rhjn2rk,wickerocker,"NTA, neither is your son. This may be hard but it is probably time for more limited contact between your son and his grandma (of course I’m sure you will talk to him about this to see how he feels). Your mom violated two rules: first by feeding him a known allergen, second by refusing to listen to your son when he expressed that he did not want to eat food he is allergic to (and who the hell *would* want to do that, if it causes hives?!). You had already set these boundaries, I presume, so it is time for consequences. Your son is an amazing guy for standing up to her, and you have done a great job teaching him to use his voice."
3,atvjvo,t2_iilli,gadgetgrl007,"NTA at all!! My 7 year old has food allergies. I have taught her to always ask/question if she is not sure. And not to eat something no matter what if it has her allergens in it. She asked about getting into trouble at school and at grandmas. I told her I dont care what school or grandma has to say about it. If it is on the cant eat list I have your back. Dont eat it. If someone wants to complain about it to me they can, but you know what you can and can not have. I would demand grandma apologize for trying to force her to eat something she knows she can not without being sick. She how she likes it. "
3,atvjvo,t2_2yukukbe,fluffymom23,"NTA Your mom is the asshole for preparing a meal she knows your child can’t eat. I have a pork intolerance and my bitch of a sister takes every chance she can get to prepare pork in something and not tell me so I’ll get sick. I will literally vomit for days if I eat pork and I can’t go anywhere bc I can vomit at any time w/o warning. I live w my mom and daughter and we’ve all just basically stopped eating at my sisters house bc of this, but she will occasionally prepare something and bring it to our house w/o me knowing it just on the off chance that I will eat some of it. Don’t let your horrid mother poison your child and then try to make you feel bad about it. It’s borderline child abuse!"
3,atvjvo,t2_5cwmo,TexasTeacher,NTA and your Mom should never be with your child unsupervised again. Your son deserves praise for doing the right thing. No one should be forced to eat food that causes them pain! This food can't kill your child - NOW he already has an epipen which means he is more likely to develop a potentially deadly reaction to something else. School house Rocks simplified lesson. Your immune system looks for attackers. When it finds one it defeats it with specialized cells. Then those cells are added to the standing defense rapid response system. This is how vaccines work. When you are allergic to something - your body misidentifies something harmless as dangerous. The cells that attack it have the wrong blue prints and flood your system with histamines. The misprogrammed cells are added to the rapid response system. Every time you are exposed it adds more of the misprogrammed cells to the system. At some point especially with food you can reach the tipping point and the amount of histamine released hits the anaphylactic shock level. &#x200B; I have anaphylactic reaction to peanuts and hive and itching to shell fish. The peanut reaction causes LESS pain - if I get medical care it is over in 72 hours. The shell fish reaction sets of a chain reaction and I can have a rash/itching for 6 months. When I say itching I'm talking fire ants crawling under my skin and biting 24 hours a day 7 days a week for MONTHS!!!! She knowingly tried to cause your son this level of pain she doesn't get to unsupervised time with any child after that in my book. &#x200B; &#x200B;
3,atvjvo,t2_382p0zll,witchyypixiee,"Definitely NTA mama bear. You're raising an awesome kid who stands by his decisions and isnt pushed over by authority to give up him convictions. Good on you! I agree with most on here. Just explain to her that it is his body, and if he does not want to eat something that would make him uncomfortable he has that right. Put it to her this way: Mosquito bites arent life threatening. But if someone asked you to to outside and get something not very important, when you know good and well youre going to get bit up by mosquitos, why would you? Regardless, youre the parent. Your mom has the right to state her opinion but not override that. Also, how would she felt if HER mother tried to put the foot down on you, her child? She would of not enjoyed that much because nobody likes someone parenting their kid. "
3,atvjvo,t2_2krlgsu2,Ebox3rchamp,"ESH old school people don’t understand what the big deal about food allergies are. They grew up in a time when that wasn’t known about or didn’t occur. Your mom needs to get with the times. You should however cut her some slack. Trying to take care of children with allergies as you know is very difficult especially in today’s times of multiple ingredients and hidden ingredients. She is doing you a solid in babysitting your child. She is helping you and you might not be paying her or paying her what you would have to someone else. I would apologize but not for “not eating the food”. I as the adult would apologize for the difficulty it is to deal with that at meal time, and what your mom considers the lost of money in the food presented. Another reason your mom May have been upset is..now the other children may say “I don’t want that, I’m not eating that” suddenly she’s got kids that won’t eat their dinner or lunch. Multiple kids can be difficult to please. Which while not your fault or technically your problem, u could still be sympathetic to understanding the situation she was presented with. She has to maintain some order or the kids would over run her. She is the AH for not accepting your sons condition as causing him discomfort that she seems to consider trivial. That isn’t fair. To make a child who is allergic to milk or whatever consume it to feel bloated and sick for the rest of the evening is not being empathetic to his comfort. Ask her if someone refused to give her Tylenol when she presented with a headache how would she feel about that person. Yeah it’s not deadly or a serious issue but still very uncomfortable. "
3,b5x6fk,t2_33zuoq2q,Dtazlyon,"NAH From what you’ve said, you help out lots around the house already, which is fantastic. I saw somewhere in another comment that you should see if you can negotiate down to once per month for babysitting, which I think is perfectly reasonable and a great suggestion. Hiring a sitter for two overnight shifts once per month isn’t an outlandish thing to ask your mom to do."
3,b21clr,t2_2tm2gxjx,Ann-von-Beaverhausen,"NTA. So, just to put this out there, if she’s like this before kids, after kids you will basically never have sex again. She’s being a jerk - dismissive of your needs, refusing to look into a medical reason for her lack of libido and condescending and dismissive of your perfectly reasonable and desirable wish to have sex with your wife. You may be fine with almost no sex - many people are. However, if you’re not, I think your marriage is doomed to fail unless your wife changes her tune. Sorry man, that sucks. "
3,b21clr,t2_jxst0yn,dapper_rabbit,"NAH. Sounds like you both have quite different sex drives. You’re not in the wrong for wanting more, and she’s not in the wrong for being comfortable with the current arrangement. Unfortunately, this might mean you two have a compatibility issue more than anything else. You ideally want a partner who matches your sex drive, but of course, tricky thing is sex drives can change throughout the lifespan. So even if you were good ages ago, that can change and it’s not really anyone’s fault. And it seems rough to break up over something like that. So from here, it’s all about communication and managing expectations. Maybe you can both look at broadening your definition of what sex is. A lot of people fall into the trap of viewing 99% of sex acts as “foreplay”, with the end game always being penetrative vaginal sex. This can get unappealing for some women over time, even if your vaginal sex is great. Basically, when sex can be small spontaneous acts rather than a whole standard event, she might warm up to it more often. Just a suggestion. Best of luck OP! I hope things turn around for both of you. :)"
3,b21clr,t2_37kbl2td,mcthrowaway_anon,"NTA. She was super mean to you, not cool. My sex drive currently far exceeds that of my husband, and I've brought it up several times in the last chunk of months. Things haven't really ""improved"" but at least he listened with compassion and we could each share our feelings and I could hear how he's doing. She sounds brutally insensitive and ignorant."
3,b21clr,t2_ipdjwal,star_guardian_carol,"NTA From a woman, most of my relationships have lasted 3 to 4 years. At 2 the sex has slowed down or stopped completely but not lack of me trying. It isn't a treat that just sometimes happens... and this actually angers me to read. Physical affection and touch are things I crave to feel love and it's no wonder to me that once these stopped I didn't feel like I was cared for anymore. So at the very least. I understand. I would tell her how you feel again. TMI: after a year of ending things with my last gf he told me how he had E.D. from scar tissue in his urethra from a traumatic event from when he was a kid. So there might be a serious underlying reason. I would talk to her and tell her it's not just sex to you. It obviously isn't just some teenage thing to get your rocks off. You could do that with porn. "

3,ax7h5u,t2_momvlrz,imatuesdayperson,"I'm leaning more toward YTA here. The cuddling isn't the problem- cuddling can be between friends, family, etc. To say that you should only cuddle with your boyfriend would be ridiculous. However, purposely starting a fight and using the money he gave you for emergencies to go to a hotel rubs me the wrong way. You and your boyfriend could both do a better job at communicating with one another. If things aren't working out, you could also find another partner without nearly as much on his plate. Also, age gaps (which aren't necessarily bad when it's between two consenting adults) can make a couple feel disconnected because of their different life goals and level of experience. A 40-something year old (especially one with multiple kids) has a different lifestyle than a 20-something year old. "
3,ac6iho,t2_1331zp,ohhannahno,"NTA. So, in summary: you have a friend who physically hurts you, who had his girlfriend send you a picture of her genitals “as a joke” because you came out to him as bisexual, when you never said you would want that and never OK’ed it, and you’re still a minor. Yeah, you’re not the asshole here, and good for you for finally ending a toxic relationship, whatever the reasoning. "
3,ac6iho,t2_8c73dod,Peralan,"NTA you can decide who you want in your company so if that crossed a line, then you cut him out of your life. I personally find the new year thing rather minor compared to the choking and biting.

That friendship should have ended a long time ago, and you should get more help with your anxiety."

"
3,b9zrc4,t2_2ld1sc4o,TossOutThisTrash,"Mostly NTA. To start with... can’t claim to know the specifics of your situation, but was how you were making the joke about him getting a girlfriend really a good idea to begin with? Some couples really don’t get each other, so that question is really just random commentary where I can imagine a “no asshole” perspective (not having been there myself). Moving forward, maybe you should quit worrying about being controlling and just be direct since it’s possible the lack of that had in some possible way that he felt validated in doing what he did(?). Or just realize that you have poor communication in your relationship but you already reproduced with him and leave him because he is insistent on maintaining that relationship that you view as toxic (and for good reason). Anyway... not the asshole, like I said."

3,arnjb9,t2_37v9fx6b,standardfair123,"NTA As a woman, I honestly thought this is a common way to discretely tell someone that you're not interested in seeing them again.

3,arnjb9,t2_1fcjdbhq,AnarchoNAP,"NTA Based on the title I was going to say no assholes, it’s a difference in values, and maybe go on cheaper first dates. But a $155 bill at a restaurant she picked?

Turns out, she thought I wanted to do it my way and was waiting for me to ask her first. Maybe your mom also views you as ""being your own woman"" and thinks you don't want/need her support the way your brother does. I wonder if you gracefully invite her to be a part of the wedding planning, maybe she'd just open up. Or...she could be playing favourites and is a shallow bitch. "
3,b393hd,t2_3dyrylw0,GinTrouble,"NTA I really don’t get some people, I recently had a woman post on a local community group furious that dogs peed on the bushes at the front of her house.

Pet people who refuse to acknowledge that they are literally forcing you to live in a constant state of illness (or in my case shortness of breath that would prevent exercise and in extreme cases makes me fear for my life).

Next step would be that he announces his distancing himself to anyone willing to listen and makes surrounding friends and friendgroups feel like they need to take a side. This happens way to often, especially since there's just a lot of people out there who will blindly take sides in issues where a friend gets with an ex of another friend. If OP were to pull off one of these then IMO that would make him TA.

3,afvqlc,t2_2jeyivxa,cactuslass,"Let me tell you a story...... My friend was dating this guy 7-8 years ago and he became part of our friend group. He was a great guy and we all loved him. He and I developed an amazing friendship and had a ton of things in common. About a year later my friend tanked her relationship with this guy, by being controlling, cheating on him, and lying. None of us took sides, we all continued to be friends with both of them. Several months after they broke up, he continued to hang out with me alone and with groups of friends (nothing happened). Finally, one day he asked me out. We went out in a date and I liked him but my younger self was like I can't date my friends ex, that's wrong. I told him I just couldn't date him right now and we continued to be friends. We both moved out of state. My girl friend found the guy of her dreams finally and is married with two kids. 2 years ago, the guy and I got back in touch with each other wondering why we ever stopped talking. We started seeing each other long distance and he eventually found a great job and moved to my town. We now are in a 2 year relationship and it's the healthiest most functional one of our lives. All I can think is how stupid I feel and how much time I wasted not being with him all these years. If I hadn't turned him down because of a stupid friend rule maybe we would have been together the last 8 years. Sometimes things don't make sense until time has passed. This sounds like the girl you dated was not the person for you or it wouldn't have ended. Your friend waited more than a year to date this girl. I think that's plenty of time. What if she's his person and yours is still out there waiting to be found? All I'm saying is don't deny your friend a chance at happiness because you can't let go of the past. He did right by communicating it to you and if you need to distance yourself that's your right. I wouldn't completely wrote him off though. Maybe talk to him and communicate your feelings. You need to treat yourself kindly and work on letting go of this girl or YTA."

They can date and you can also choose to step back from a friendship if you know that you can't mentally and emotionally handle them dating, at least not at this point in time. That doesn't make you an asshole or a weak person as long as you are aware that you need to move on and are actively trying to do this. It doesn't mean that you have to resume being his friend like nothing happened in the future, just that you're continuing to work on yourself. It sounds like you're working on this based on your post, so I think that you should just continue to do you. Your friend was aware of your feelings for her and as such, should understand why you're stepping back. If he doesn't understand why you aren't continuing on the way you were, then he's definitely the asshole in this scenario. He doesn't have to get your permission to date her, but he does need to be aware of the consequences."

But YTA for thinking you hold a claim to your ex, another human being, who has the right to date who she sees fit. Your relationship with her ended. Over a year ago, no less. If it makes you feel any better, one of my friends started dating my ex about a year after we amicably broke up. While a bit painful at first, we still got along and I'm still good friends with both of them. I was even a part of their wedding party when they eventually tied the knot. "

I imagine compared to your highschool days, your parents would be proud to hear your college experience thus far, with the exception of a single class, has been going well. Don't beat yourself up so much; college is difficult for a variety of reasons. Seek additional help for classes you struggle with, that way you're being responsible about your grades and outwardly demonstrating a commitment to correcting your failures. Seriously though, stress only makes things worse. Take a breath, relax, and know that you are in control and so long as you're trying to succeed, you're not wasting anything. "

Nothing that's going wrong with him is your fault, so his mistakes and his addictions and shit really aren't your responsibility. You really did all you could do as a friend, and he clearly didn't appreciate it, so fuck him. He is not your responsibility, so if he's gonna be a cunt, he can go fuck himself. My mother is in a similar situation with my brother. My brother has drug abuse issues, and mental illnesses so he has been living with my mom without working or paying for anything while he just smokes weed and sleeps. He is also emotionally and verbally abusive to my mom, like he was to me (except he was also physically abusive to me) when we were living together, so my mom said that's enough so if he keeps doing this shit he's out in an instant with no more money from my mother. He's 20, and at this point my mother has done all she can for him, while he just does nothing and isn't planning on doing anything while being incredibly abusive. I love my brother a lot, even if he was very abusive to me and is abusive to my mom, I don't want him to die. At this point though my mom can't afford to live with him, and she can't mentally cope with his shit anymore. He has been to many psychiatrists and counsellors, but the issue is is that he isn't willing to change himself. Now there's nothing to be done except tell him if he doesn't change he's gone. In this situation I think my mom's NTA, so in your situation you are definitely NTA aswell."
3,b32h6v,t2_g7knv1f,jolie178923-15423435,"NTA There's nothing wrong with reconnecting with your father, but: >as happy as he's been to reconnect it really makes me sad it took this long and as happy as he seems it really doesn't make sense that he stayed so out of touch, which makes me think a lot of it was my mother and her attitude, she has always been controlling and manipulative and I have realized this as I have grown and had children of my own. Your mom might be a giant bitch, but it still doesn't excuse your father for abandoning his kids and not paying child support. He had a responsibility to you that he totally blew off. Legally, your mother *couldn't* have kept him out of your life. He did that because it was easier."
3,aar77b,t2_1wq6pp64,NotYourClone,"NTA My advice would be to say no and explain to his parents that you don’t have any games that they consider age appropriate for their son, mentioning that the only games you have are rated T or M. That way it doesn’t come off as you being rude for not sharing (I have seen far too many posts where the aunts/uncles automatically think their kid can do whatever they want in another persons home). My point is be civil and bring this up to his parents and have an adult talk with them while calmly stating your reasons and ask if they can get their kid to stop asking about it because the answer will continue to be ‘no’. If that doesn’t work or the kid keeps asking anyway (especially since they are sleeping in the same room with it and kids can be sneaky) you can always disconnect it and store it somewhere else until they leave."
3,b5b5di,t2_7keu2,You_just_never_know,"NTA, you get to spend a few days out of the month with this girl that you really really like, you even make special plans for her birthday and get her a beautiful gift. And then to find that she’s invited her friends along to all your plans, that’s a bit of a bitch move. These are people she sees more or less every day, she really didn’t need to invite them along. Best thing I could suggest is having a sit down with her, explain that you understand that she’s upset with the way you acted, however the fact that you had these plans to spend one on one time together and she invited her friends made you feel like crap when you already get so little time with her. Maybe suggest she comes to visit you instead next time so there’s no chance for her to change any plans that you make. I know it’s a bit shit, but it sounds like you value the relationship more than she does, I’m really hoping for the best here, but be prepared if things do go sideways."

I don’t know the details of your responsibilities, but you don’t do the meals, homework, lunches, sports during the week? That stuff consumes a lot of time. Equal to or more than your 6 hours in a car."
3,b54zgt,t2_wsgvl1i,anono92466,"What? You child is experiencing instability in his life (mom and step dad separating) and the loss of one of his male role models... and you want to make that worse for him? Adding more instability in changing his schedule and seeing you less. If yes- then YTA. The child needs to come first. They have absolutely no control over any of this right now. You do. Step up.,"
3,b54zgt,t2_1147ah,3ar3ara_G0rd0n,"Just a little bit YTA. I get it though. It sucks for you. What is more important to you? How would your child feel if he found out one adult doesn't want to drop him off but his bio dad won't pick him up either because he lives far away which he had no control over? Barring some horrible situation that would prevent this - think of your child first. It sucks big time that you have to do the driving, but if that's the only way, don't punish your kid for that. My own personal experience sort of relates. My parents are married but my dad had to make a major sacrifice one year. My dad had to work in St. Louis for 7 months while we lived around Hinsdale, IL. Every weekend, like clockwork he would drive back home and drive back to work for the week. Occasionally he would get to fly like if there was an important event (birthday, sports, etc) but driving is cheaper. My sister and I were in high school though and we told him it's okay if he misses a weekend or two because it's far! But that's because we were older and understood. Why did he have to do this? His job moved there and I just had open heart surgery. He needed the money and insurance for me. So while he looked for a job near home, he still had to work so we would be okay. "

3,b54zgt,t2_3dm2l1vc,mbergescapee,"NTA - but your son’s mom kinda is. I get that this is a difficult situation for her and I understand that she’s busy with work. That doesn’t negate HER responsibility to meet you halfway, especially since she’s the one who moved. It’s not just your responsibility to make sure you get to see your son. She should be putting in an equal effort to make sure that he gets to see you too! Putting the burden of transportation solely on you because of her work schedule is a crap move. Frankly, this problem is one that results from her decisions and not yours. I’d understand if this was a once in a while thing for her but you haven’t mentioned her making any effort to resolve what looks to be a long-term issue. Imagine if she had come on here and said, “I moved further away from my son’s father to be with my husband. I’m in the process of getting divorced and my soon to be ex-husband won’t meet my son’s father halfway for drop offs anymore. Will I be the asshole if I expect my son’s father to drive an extra 100 miles every weekend so that he can see him? I can’t meet him halfway because I have work.” She’d get a hell of a lot of YTA responses, I think. It would probably be best for your son if you continued getting him every weekend but it doesn’t make you the asshole for recognizing that it’s difficult and unfair. It doesn’t make you the asshole because you now have to reconsider how things could pan out if she doesn’t step up. It will cost you more money and time. That’s the practical result and that affects you and the rest of your family. Maybe instead of splitting the distance equally each way, you could discuss with your ex each of you driving the full distance one way? You pick up on Friday and she comes to get him on Sunday or vice versa. That means she only has to rearrange her work schedule on one day of the week. You could even tell her it doesn’t matter when each person does the drive, just whichever works best for her. You’ll do the full drive on whichever day she truly can’t. "
3,a29xtv,t2_12t8fb,mugrita,"NTA. I was about to say that her comment about being family might have been a good faith gesture about being welcoming, joining the spirit of giving, etc but then saw your comment about how you’re not close to her kids. It’d be one thing if you WERE close to the kids, like you were a fun aunt/uncle type but this sounds like a gift grab. Important question: do you know if she is planning to get you a gift? It’s a major asshole move on her part if she’s hitting up everyone who knows the kids for presents but isn’t giving a gift in return. If a gift is coming your way, then she was genuine about treating you like family and involving you in their holiday plans. Tell her that money is tight right now so you’ll be giving them homemade or cheap presents like cookies, candy, or scarves/hats. If no gift is coming your way, stick to your guns. I will warn that you might come off as an asshole to everyone else in this situation because it’s going to be like “BUT IT’S CHRISTMAS AND THE KIDS SHOULD HAVE PRESENTS WHY ARE YOU SUCH A GRINCH?” Hopefully everyone is understanding of your money situation but if the mom or the roommate try to hound you to buy a gift, stick to something homemade or cheap.

So she purchased a pair of bluetooth headphones that allowed him to set his own individual volume level while leaving the TV at a reasonable volume for her.

The ration books I wouldn’t even know where to look as far as value. You did make out, but not so much anyone would be thinking you took undue advantage. If it’s in working order, and barring anything “special” that would increase the value, you should probably be able to get $800 or $900 out of it anyway.

Well CeX buy it for 32 and sell for 70, it seems that thos guy sold all 7 steelbooks to the same shop as this one location (i bought online but can check online) suddenly had them all in stock. All in all I guess the guy made about £90 and could have gotten upwards of 500 on ebay. Point is, they never checked their worth and that's on them.

Implying there was no skill or time put in on your end is ridiculous. This would maybe be different if he was a nice guy that wanted to give you a good deal or do you a favor.

On the other hand, if there are a bunch of other qualities about this woman that negate her bad ones, you can always do what one person I know did. He proposed to his gf, but refused to set a date until she had paid off her debt (about $50k in credit, college was paid for in full by her parents). He told her it was a dealbreaker, because if she couldn’t manage her finances by herself or ask him to help her manage it he couldn’t see a long term future with her because of the differences in how they perceived money.

But just from my SO's experience, his ex couldn't be motivated to do ANYTHING for herself, even after 10+ years, and still to this day.

I asked him not to do this and he didn't stop and claimed he couldn't help it. I eventually had to end the friendship over it. I agree that you don't want to have your friend feel left out, but you also don't need to have someone around who is disregarding your belongings like this.

In a city with a lot pedestrians and a lot people who regularly commute by foot, you are probably fine. It's incredibly rude to leave your car any where you can obstruct the flow of traffic and really potentially putting a lot of people's lives at risk (since they have to cross in the street in front of or behind your car). In a city where cars are little more valued people seem to get irrationally offended by you touching their car. As if birds don't shit on it and homeless people don't pee on it when they aren't looking. I have nearly been hit plenty by cars that pull into the crosswalk while I am using it and getting angry about nearly getting run over seems legit to me.

It's fine to have specific requirements for who you'll date, you can cut down your own dating pool in any way you like (for instance I don't date people with different political beliefs) but you need to have that conversation BEFORE you start a relationship with someone, not months into the relationship. If you know you can't be with someone who doesn't have a thriving career and a lot of financial ambition, that's like a ""within three dates"" conversation to have. Also, your post does come off like you think you're better than everyone, which is pretty normal for being 22 but will eventually get in your way if you want to have a long-term intimate relationship. You don't need to panic about it right now, some of that will automatically change as you mature and have more life experiences, but you might want to start thinking about working through some of the reasons you feel like that in preparation for the stage of your life where a superiority complex will no longer be cute and will start getting you fired/dumped."
3,b94vdb,t2_j3j4l,MRmandato,"YTA. You are in your early fucking 20s. Basically still children and working things out. If you were 35 it would be a different story but tons of people use their twenties in normal jobs while they figure out what they want to do instead of getting into debt with tons of degrees but no idea. It insane that you would right off someone so young just for what they currently are doing or their current plans. People change and people are more than their job. People also sometimes dont have the money to go to school or the connections to make 75,000 right out of college. That coupled with you bragging about your expected income makes you sound immature and a bit insecure. "
3,asudh6,t2_e2rl1d,jgslcut,"YTA - Reminds me of a time I was playing blackjack in Vegas about 20 years ago. An Australian kid (in his 20's) was playing with us. Every time a good looking girl would walk past he would get up and go ask for their number. This happened several times, and every time he would do it he would hold up our game play. As he came back to the table after one of these episodes, he looked at us with a big grin on his face and said ""those who hesitate go home and masturbate!"" I was jealous of his confidence. You should just take it as a compliment."

"
3,almfgo,t2_ic31mho,Clown3aby,"NTA. When I'm at the gym, I'm there to work out, not talk. I have a limited amount of time to work out in the morning before work so my gym time is precious. For some people, the gym is just another social club and they couldn't care less about actually doing anything but talk. I always wear my headphones as the universal ""fuck off"" symbol but even that doesn't stop people sometimes. These are the same asshats that curl in the squat rack, or take up a bench for over an hour because they just lean on it and talk to people and maybe do a set here or there and then not even re-rack the weights they ""used"".

People take advantage of that, and what you did at least will be a surefire way of making sure he doesn't interrupt your workouts again. Besides, the dude probably won't even care after a few days maximum"
3,9v8uty,t2_3w3z812,Originalwookie, NTA depending on how it’s pronounced it will be pretty easy for his dickhead classmates to tease him and naming him “cat” isn’t gonna do him any favors either. Remember children are monsters when adults aren’t looking I’d recommend something more traditional.

3,ay29oa,t2_6qnyb,Murdiff,"ETA there are some serious red flags here. If you’re going to get married you’re going to be sharing space and that currently sounds like a problem. Not only because you want your own space but because she is very messy and you are not, how will you handle that when you live together? Getting married is about building a life together not if something is or is not your responsibility. You should want to help her out and at the same time she should realize the effort you are putting in and not take advantage of it. It sounds like a long engagement might be a good idea, the pressure of the ‘foreverness’ of marriage will probably make these issues worse. "
3,ay29oa,t2_awff2,CatherineConstance,"YTA/ESH - why are you guys even together?! You live together but you don't want to share a room with her. You only have one car but don't consider it a shared vehicle and you don't care about her well being or her education. If you don't want her to be your problem (which you clearly don't considering you're annoyed with having to drive her to school and you don't want your FIANCEE in ""your room"" because you need space ???) then that is your right, but don't call her your fiancee if you don't want to act like people who are about to get married. You don't get to have your own room in most marriages, and you need to be there for each other and be partners and help each other out. Y'all really don't seem like you should be getting married, to each other or anyone else any time soon."
3,a341w7,t2_2kvbpz7t,Sybellie,Nta. I grew up in home with cats that had free range and always hated that they would sleep on my pillow and I would breath in their hair. When I got my own place and got a cat I trained him to never set foot on my pillow. And he doesn't. He also doesn't sleep with us long so doesn't disturb our sleep. Like most people here have said a dog bed next to your bed or at the foot is a good compromise imo. And maybe have a blanket you cover your bed with when u are not sleeping so if the dogs r on it during the day it can be removed at night.

3,ba2tgk,t2_j9afo,Salt-Pile,"YTA, she didn't make up the policy - she was just doing her (low paid) job - if you don't like it, the people you should take it up with are the management of your Walmart. Which you haven't done. You sound like you were also needlessly rude. >I just want to come in a buy my things and leave in peace, I'm not stealing anything.

He knew the spots were on a first-come, first-served basis as he'd done the trip before, and you went out of your way to remind him several times to send in his deposit. If it had been me, and despite all of the reminders you gave him, I *probably* would have reached out to him when the other organizer said he potentially had a 16th to tell Trevor ""hey, the trip is literally about to fill up and if you don't send in your deposit RIGHT NOW you're not going to get to come along"" to give him the opportunity. But I don't think the fact that you didn't do this makes you an asshole. This is on Trevor, it's his fault for not following through despite numerous reminders."

3,adr3ge,t2_2osjz7z6,SharpShel,"NTA. I want so badly to err on the side of this just being a huge miscommunication of sorts. But damn. Your sister knows that momentarily your boyfriend is coming to let her in. When she sees a young man approaching her/the door, why wouldn’t she logically figure that’s probably who it was? Rather than reaching for the mace, why not say “Hey, are you (OP’s) boyfriend?” She went from zero to batshit crazy really quick, and her stupid racial profile text to you kind of shows where her head was at. Then to top it off, she doesn’t even apologize? She sounds awful. "
3,adr3ge,t2_111o2n,IncredibleGonzo,"Has she never seen a picture of your boyfriend? That's a bit weird these days! Anyway, NTA. Wasn't sure until the sister's response after the incident. You wouldn't be the asshole anyway, but while her reaction to your boyfriend was *definitely* assholeish, it's also *sort of* understandable that she'd be scared by a dude she didn't know at night (not saying it's ok to pepper spray unprovoked though). But someone who's generally not an asshole would have been super apologetic as soon as she found out what was going on. When she did the complete opposite is when she went from base level asshole to raging monster loony asshole. Of course she was also being racist before the pepper spray happened, so bonus asshole points there."
3,adr3ge,t2_um9qi,LordGopu,"I know sometimes it's hard to see the truth of situations when you're in them, especially when it involves family or friends. We've all been there I'm sure. In this case though, just read the posts here. Everyone is flipping out because your sister is fucked. You can't assault random people because you ""felt scared"". She certainly seems like a racist asshole, and that's reason enough not to speak to her anymore. Even if her actions weren't racially motivated, she assaulted a stranger for no reason and will not accept responsibility. Another good reason to not associate her. Again I know cutting people out of your life can be difficult, depending on how you were raised (some people are raised with a very ""family before all"" mentality) but at the very least she needs to be cut from your life. Pressing charges is up to you guys, obviously. There is a certain amount of hassle there but she certainly deserves it for attacking someone and being unrepentant. If she did it once why wouldn't she do it again (or hasn't done it already?)?"
3,a8xu19,t2_271lh6er,ShreddedDaphy,"Nta for wanting it, and good on you for not pushing it. Could there be a bigger problem behind it? When you ask her about it does she just kind of poopoo the subject or does she wanna discuss it?

Any number of things can affect a persons sex drive. "

I've been to stores where the employees mainly speak Mandarin or Spanish or whatever and never had a problem. I have a lot of ESL friends and family who natively speak other languages and while I get feeling left out or confused, asking someone to speak English for a conversation I'm not even involved in and have zero stake in sounds way out of line, especially if it impedes others' workflows. Stuff that needs to be communicated to me will be translated eventually."

Other than that, the other people in the staff lunchroom should not be complaining if they are not part of the convo, they should just be minding their own business. "

3,b29i7w,t2_10bupl,kyle47382919,NTA If half the class is actually failing or in fear of failing that sounds more like a teacher problem than an academic issue.

Anyway now that my rant it done NTA."
3,b29i7w,t2_ma563bl,bingal33dingal33,"NTA, but there are probably other ways to deal with this to get yourself a better outcome. Complaining to the administration will probably not help you, and if your administrators are incompetent, she might find out it was you who made a complaint. If she's been around as long as you say, she probably has tenure and the administration won't do anything about her. Even if they decided to fire her, there would be a drawn out battle with the teachers' union. It is highly unlikely that you would get a new geometry teacher this year. Personally demonstrate to her that you want to do extra work to learn. Even if it's useless, ask her for extra help. They'll never tell you, but a lot of teachers cut major slack for their favorite students. If other kids are getting results by ignoring her lectures and self-teaching, do that. There are resources online like Khan Academy that have videos and instructions to help you learn math concepts. Early geometry is a lot of memorization, so you might just have to do it yourself. Get your teacher to see that you want to improve and do it."
3,b29i7w,t2_hqg4o,everlyafterhappy,"NTA He's not doing his job. It's fucking up your life. You should talk to the administration. Don't sorry about getting him fired. If he can't so his job then he should be fired. He probably won't be because of tenure, but you might be able to get a different teacher or get the administration to give him a different job, maybe teaching remedial math or just supervising study hall. And from the little bit you said about him he seems like an asshole. Over half the class is doing poorly and the biggest common factor is that he's the teacher yet he wants to say you guys aren't paying attention and need to do better. That makes him an asshole."

Was she even invited by your brother? Will he mind hosting the both of you, instead of just you? Firstly you need to check with your brother to see if he can afford to feed you both for however long you are going. He's choosing the cheapest option to get his bike over there, does he have the money to host and entertain two people? Secondly, you need to talk to your girlfriend about the first point I made. Then talk to her about the fact, that you are not buying half her ticket. "
3,b42d2o,t2_lummb5j,RainbowYaz,"NTA I can see why she would assume she was going to get to go. When couples lives together for as long as you mentioned in another post, you tend to do almost everything together. You never said she was going though, so she jumped the gun. I'd try to talk to her about it. If possible, maybe offer to pay a portion of her ticket. It's kinda weird to me that you guys live together and don't have shared finances, but just do your best to explain the situation to her and tell her how you do want her there and let her know how much you could give her toward a ticket."

He may disregard your tears because they come so easily and frequently, but as your partner he needs to allow you to have feelings (and you need to allow him his). You know already you need to work on crying over things so readily. The bigger issue here is the poor communication about both of your needs. He likely needed space to decompress after his long day before trying to be social or eat. You needed attention and appreciation for the meal you cooked. He needed a feeling of security at home and you needed to feel like he still loves you despite the screwup with the door. This stuff isn't getting communicated in a clear, direct, considerate way. I'm starting to feel like a broken record because this is the third time I have suggested it today, but please read _How to Be An Adult In Relationships_ by David Richo.

You definitly couldnt have known if she hadnt mentioned it earlier, nor did you actually praise nazies. Just fyi, when you talk about good stuff the nazies did (that are extremly overshadowed by the evil ofc), just try and do it carefully when talking to someone jewish.

If they other player was worse of than you in the game trading with them is inherently better than trading with you.

It takes up a lot more of my time and effort than just leaving out or replacing an ingredient because someone is trying to avoid/doesn’t like a certain type of food.

3,a5k48f,t2_h5yhw,Vangey,"NTA for asking this of him. It'd be much different if it came in the form of a demand. Also I don't think you'd be the asshole if you asked for it to continue until the sex drive eases up if he's receptive. Have you explored any options to see if any other changes could be made? Something even as simple as ""if you're willing to try again is there anything we could change up to make it easier for you?"" As far as is his ""need"" normal; as a guy I can say man brain can be weird. From my experience we don't ""need"" porn, but sometimes the urge to just rub one out is very real. Porn just helps you hit the finish line faster."

It is obvious you’ve left some things out here-no one can get a restraining order against you without some clear evidence that you pose a serious risk to them. There’s more to this, and that is why you’re not seeing your son. Unless she lied to the courts, you’re definitely the asshole. The courts do *not* always favor the woman; it’s more difficult if you’re not married (is your name on the birth certificate?) and the child is really young. Most courts want both parents as involved as possible, unless it’s proven you aren’t able to care properly for him due to your own health, you’re an abusive person or abusing substances.

If I were you I would respond in a borderline asshole way by having them clean my house again and then defaulting in payment by calling their boss and informing them of this little situation.

It would be one thing if they had established history or if there was some mutual connection but there isn’t.

Ultimately not going further is the right thing for both, you don’t owe her a relationship and you are in your right of choosing who you date, and this “fell in love of my personality” is just an optimistic fantasy, it’s a mix of everything, physical appearance, sex life, family life, everything needs to be in harmony for a relationship to work out, “my personality” can only take you so far before getting worn out because of the incompatibility on other fields, which will lead to a break up. And she deserves someone that it’s willing to commit to her condition, someone that is willing to take care of her in her moments of need because of love, the best way to find that is by being upfront about who she is, there will be rejections of course, but that happens to everybody, handicapped or not, lying about who we are only lead to failed relationships"

That wouldn't have been a lie, it would have been telling the truth tactfully and with maturity and kindness. Instead you insulted her, told her you wouldn't have accepted the date if you knew she was handicapped, and got annoyed at her. I mean, you were so mean you made her cry.

She could have loved hearing about your kids, but you would have had an obligation to tell her about them beforehand, not just dropped it like a bombshell during the first date because you were ""nervous for her reaction"".

So you felt the need to basically say ""Date over not happening"" it doesnt matter that you liked her and she was easy to talk to.... Maybe you're an ableist. But the middle of a date is not the best time to grind an axe. You should have finished the date and afterwards transitioned to a strictly platonic relationship.

She's been disabled since birth, so she's well aware that her disability not only affects her, but those around her. To start a relationship on a foundation of dishonesty is just... not a great way to begin. Both Sara and your mutual friend handled themselves badly here. You also handled yourself badly. Being lied to sucks, but telling a disabled person that who they are as a person is irrelevant--to you, they are only their disability is just a total dick move. You liked Sara enough to go out with her after getting to know her. You saw the wheelchair, got annoyed, and basically said, ""you're disabled, so this won't work.""

Also, to everyone admonishing OP's bluntness and lack of tact - it seems like you're interpreting it as him saying ""you're handicapped, not gonna work, peace"". Well first of all I should point out that he did spend an hour there so he didn't just 'walk out'. But also, his blunt behavior was in *direct* response to her statement about trying to hide it. So I wouldn't only say it's hard to feel sorry for her, I'd almost say it was in place and justified.

This was shitty on behalf of the date. You were put in a tough situation, and yes I’m sure it hurt her quite a bit and sure you could have done it more delicately and in a better fashion, but “I know you wouldn’t like me but maybe if I hide something and put you on the spot you’ll like me and won’t even notice this huge aspect of me that would affect your lifestyle” not cool.

You even have reason to be upset because of the fact she left out really important details to her situation. However - Man, there's just times in life where you're going to have to keep certain opinions/comments/feelings to yourself. This girl has obviously had it rough in the dating department, she's undoubtedly self conscious about her situation and you're the perfect example as to why. Everyone wants to feel wanted and loved, her disability has probably hindered her when it comes to dating the entirety of her life. That's obviously not your problem but there's no reason to add fuel to the fire, how would you feel in her position? Be a gentleman, respect her feelings as a human, suck it up for an hour or two and enjoy the conversation. After the date part ways, text her later advising you didn't feel a connection but wish her the best, at least have some fucking tact. That's it man, there's no need to be so straight forward and rude, no need to make her feel even worse than she clearly already did about her situation.

3,aw7rpq,t2_2lljj33b,Luckythepunk,YTA in a major way. Put yourself in her shoes. It has to be difficult to date people in that situation (granted you should’ve been told of her condition beforehand) so you go out and have what seems like a decent date with someone and then are told I don’t want to date over something you can’t control. It’s going to make it more difficult after that. Not to mention you can’t remember shit about the date itself so it seems like you didn’t care to begin with anyways. You can’t hide behind well I was honest thing all the time. Sometimes ignorance is bliss and she would have had more confidence after had you not pulled that BS. Also as a side note you sound like a stereotypical nice guy. “Well I did buy her coffe and a croissant.” As if she should appreciate a five dollar meal for you acting like a dick. Grow the fuck up and accept your judgement.

3,aw7rpq,t2_2ul7ro3l,Atux67,"YTA for the way you handled it. You should have just been nice about it and not seen her again, say something like I just didn’t feel a connection. This is one of those cases where in my opinion a lie is better than the truth. IMTA for when I went on a tinder girl and when she arrived her photos were about 5 years out of date. Basically she was very plus sized. In my defence I don’t mind a girl being a little chubby but I’m really not ok with obese and the more she talked about her life style of heavy drinking, take always and fast food with no intention of changing as if she was proud I just sat there thinking no this isn’t going to work. I value my health and have lost over 100lbs I’m not going to go back to being obese. I’ve seen the damage it does to relatives with diabetes, gout, growths etc which could be prevented by being a healthy bmi. I was nice about it. We had a friendly date/meeting for a couple of hours. It wasn’t terrible conversation but I felt no attraction to her and I did feel a little tricked in to it. She actually wanted me to come home with her too but I refused - so I turned down an easy lay because I didn’t like the girl. I just ghosted her afterwards - probably not the best way to handle it but it was better than saying “you lied about your pictures and I don’t find you attractive.”"
3,aw7rpq,t2_21l6rw78,Babyhandgrenade,"YTA Dude I'm sorry but I didn't even read your post. I have Muscular Dystrophy and I should be in a chair all the time but I don't want to be. To reject someone on the basis that they are disabled makes you a huge ass hole. It makes you sound shallow. You shouldn't judge someone based on whether or not they were in a wheelchair because you could be missing out on a really good partner. I hate it when people assume that because I'm in a chair that means that I am mentally challenge. Not that there's anything wrong with people who are mentally challenged oh, it's just that I wish people would stop seeing the chair and automatically equating it to mentally challenged. I can hear and understand like anybody else. Actually I'm pretty smart and friendly and funny and my friends tell me that I am a great person to be around. If you're going to be shallow and narrow your dating pool to only people who look normal for lack of a better term than you are seriously missing out. But hey, if you're going to be that shallow then you deserve the shallow people that you're going to get in return. And that's all I have to say about that. Okay I will edit this a little bit and say that she should have been forthcoming with you about the fact that she's in a wheelchair before you met up. Normally I let people get to know me as a person over text before I tell them that I'm disabled. That way they can judge for themselves whether they would like to know me based on what they know about me as a person rather than quickly jumping to the fact that I'm in a wheelchair and letting it turn them off. Regardless of that, you are the asshole for rejecting her simply because she's in a wheelchair."
3,aw7rpq,t2_13dgbf,Sylvi2021,"YTA for how you handled things. I’m disabled. I have an arm that is fully deformed and looks really gross.

I can usually tell when someone is just overwhelmed by my condition but I have never in 15 years of dating had someone legitimately get mad I didn’t tell them I was disabled before a date or leave in a huff because of the fact. Yes, it would have been nice for her to tell you. But people really do prejudge those with disabilities. She likely wanted not to focus on her wheelchair. What actually probably happened was your friend thought your personality and the girls would mesh well so she wanted you to not reject her for her wheelchair without giving her a chance - which you did anyway. You’re definitely an asshole. Your post and replies radiate the fact. That girl dodged a bullet by getting rid of you. "

Which is why she wanted you to see her personality first. I know plenty of people who married or is in a relationship with someone in a wheelchair. The chair doesn't bother them... why?

Her being a paraplegic would 100% affect any relationship you might have, and it's up to you whether you want to take that one. Am I saying that she's not worth being in a relationship with or that it wouldn't be fulfilling? No, but she doesn't get to try and trap or trick you into dating her. If she was morbidly obese and sent you pictures from five years ago when she was skinny we would all agree that that was dishonest and unfair, and this is the same thing. Yes some fat people are lovely (I am), but no one is required to date one and we don't get to trick people in to it."

In the moment even a politician would struggle in this predicament. It’s a terrible situation to be put in - either lie or hurt someone’s feelings. And I actually think it’s more respectful to tell the truth, much less condescending than assuming they can’t handle the truth. And when people try to be too delicate often the message loses meaning and clarity. If anybody needed the cold hard truth it was these two girls that came up with this sick plan. He was even generous with his time, staying for an entire hour, having a sincere conversation as two new friends, and then worked up the courage to disqualify her as a lover. Im honestly impressed. I was catfished once and I was more more angry than OP at being lied to. Although I had wasted a lot of time, money and affection before we met in person. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_32ufxhsm,VividMaterial,"ESH. Being impaired like that is definitely something that I might consider a deal breaker if I were in that position. YTA for lack to tact however having the girl not tell you is like priming a grenade and tossing it in between you two. How you handled it was panic driven and I'm not surprised it blew up in her face. At the end of it the date was ""blind"" though and you should have seen it through "
3,aw7rpq,t2_ypigm,ca_agent,"NTA. You spent time with her, but you didn't let her think that it was okay to deceive you or that there was a chance for something in the future. I don't know how the actual moment felt but I'll bet that she had gotten her hopes up and that's the cause of the upset. That's not your fault, that's due to both of them. "
3,aw7rpq,t2_2pr6cky6,CeleryRoot1983,"ESH, but mostly YTA. Sometimes you need to look beyond they physical and get to know the person. I have a friend in a wheel chair, and she gets dismissed from conversations like a child (people will talk to me while looking away from her). Drives me nuts. She is a freaking great woman, beautiful, but the wheel chair freaks people out. Just like it freaked you out. That being said, obviously you are not the type of person who can handle somebody in a wheel chair, so it's for the best you didn't keep it going just to be nice. She could have avoided this scenario had you been informed ahead of time. Could have been nicer about it though. "
3,9zndzt,t2_c1esebo,SirrahGreed,"YTA - A tad bit. Suggest Keto for him, weight loss with similar caloric intake without exercise being overly vital (it works well for sedentry? lifestyles/little exercise/office jobs). Also if you're friends are overly judgmental, get new ones."
3,9zndzt,t2_16pqaq,HostileErectile,"I would feel the same. It's a huge character flaw and a pathetic way to live as overweight. It reflects on you. And people certainly judge you and wonder why exactly you're with a person so much beneath you. They will view you as lower status and quality because why in the world are you in such a situation. Does he have money? Do you have low self respect or low confidence? So yea... You should feel shame because people judge you. He is mentally pathetic as he cant lose weight which of course he can no matter schedule. Losing weight in essence frees up the calendar, now he needs to spend less time eating to much. So again, you're not an asshole for feeling ashamed, you should feel ashamed. He is a giant red flickering light that shows your own character flaws and self hate towards the whole world."

As for who should pay or not pay, who should work and who should stay at home with the kids, or who in a relationship should do anything else, that's the business of the couple in the relationship, and not anyone else. I don't think your mother's age is significant here, because even 30 years ago when she was your age, there were stay at home fathers, and dating couples going dutch. "
3,b3zaka,t2_kcjmy,travelsizegirl,"NTA, you're entitled to your opinions and name-calling is childish and bullshit. Your generation is more fluid in gender roles than hers, so you will likely never see eye to eye on this. I share your views, so it's hard for me to relate to her perspective, but you just have to chalk it up to the fact that she grew up in a different time. She's also entitled to her views, it's just the name-calling and insults that take this into asshole territory for me."
3,a1v1ph,t2_ojdfd,sarahmgray,"**NTA.** I mean, holy fuck, who does that to kids?! That’d be uncomfortable for many *adult* siblings. Casting *young teenage siblings* as a couple is absolutely inappropriate. Frankly, even if both you and your sister were 100% comfy with it, it is STILL wrong for the director to cast you two as a romantic couple - your being cool with it is not the same as your peers being cool with it. Your peers are teenagers, and teenagers are nasty little shits to each other. The amount of nasty teenage assholery that you and/or your sister will face if you play a romantic couple is likely significant; being okay with the casting is not the same as being okay with that type of social stress. - You can’t know the social fallout of playing these roles or how long it’ll last. - You can’t know how successfully you or your (very young) sister will be able to handle the teasing, insults, and rumors. - You can’t know how it’ll impact your relationship with your sister (but it probably won’t be positive). Deal with public jokes and rumors about incest and being romantically involved with your sibling for a few weeks ... you’ll be *amazed* by how quickly you stop being comfortable acting like normal siblings. You simply should *never* have been put in this position in the first place. One of you should quit. The directors are fucking assholes. "
3,a1v1ph,t2_2lllgxc1,UnfairCanary,"NTA. I’m an adult and have been an educator. I’d suggest you talk to a counselor or the principal or whomever has authority to help advocate with you. This was lazy on behalf of the adults involved and I think there may be a way to make you both happy. Maybe your sister, as talented as she is, grows and learns through something else for another year. Don’t let your seeming good nature get in the way of standing up for yourself. You should be a little mad because of this."
3,a1v1ph,t2_175dgg,blitheobjective,"NTA. They are the assholes (those directors and whoever else was involved in casting) for their incompetence. This was absolutely a mistake that no one but you is trying to correct. However, doing anything about it is only going to hurt you (or your sister). Either one of you will change roles or you will quit the play, so you have to weigh what's worse to you- losing the role (and the awards/role to put your resume/etc.) or the situation of having you and your sister playing a couple. If you're already willing to take the role of coach then it sounds like you're already ready to take a worse role to get out of the situation. If you're going into acting as a career though (as it sounds like you are, as it sounds like your family is in the business), think carefully about this since the bigger role on your resume can make a difference to certain casting agents and directors, especially when you're first starting out and don't have much. Little things build onto bigger things. The best solution, since it sounds like nobody was cast based on who would be best for which role since the directors haven't the first clue about HSM, would be for either you or your sister to be switched with another more or less equal role. This would of course inconvenience someone else who already has another role too but this would be the most fair thing all around. That said, it's not in your hands to decide that and if the directors are this inept then they probably won't want to bother. My advice would be for you (or get your father/parents) to go above the heads of the directors if you can and talk to the principal/program director/whoever may be above them and explain the situation including that the directors had no idea really who they were casting for what besides a general ""lead"" or ""supporting"" type of idea. It is inappropriate to cast siblings as love interests in teen productions and the directors didn't even know they were doing it. If you think they may be open to it, you could also try talking to the directors too, you never know. Otherwise it's just taking that smaller coach part as you mentioned, if they let you, or dropping out, or sucking it up and playing the role of Chad with your sister. Finally, in the business you may have to do things you're uncomfortable with, and I'm sure siblings have played love interests in professional settings before (though I try to imagine say Jake and Maggie playing love interests and it's skeevy) and you just deal with it for the sake of your own career. But since this was done unknowingly by the directors out of incompetence, and since you're a teen and not an adult, then personally I think something should be done here to get one of you a different role. &#x200B;"
3,a1v1ph,t2_d1m0ei9,Basketeetch,"NTA. I would be so fucking creeped out. You wouldn't be an asshole for just quitting completely, but don't make an impulsive decision about that just because you're pissed--It was dumb of the directors not to familiarize themselves with the script first, but if they can move you or your sister into a different role, would you still enjoy doing the play? If so, just approach the directors and let them know you'll need to be recast if you're going to remain in the play."
3,aorwnz,t2_rcmj1,Gouranga56,"YTA So talking to you wife about your issues, perfectly fine and given the history you put up, understandable. Try to dictate to her who she can and cannot have in the delivery room when she is giving birth, dick move.

You have more chance of being struck by lightning in your lifetime, than dying during childbirth in the uk. (O.003% vs 0.008%). Bluntly: your Wife should be siding with you here, not an asshole at all. NTA "
3,aorwnz,t2_gdw35ou,ellensundies,"NTA. I’ve birthed three kids, so I’ve been thru this experience a few times and am quite familiar with the physical and emotional stresses involved. Further, I am now with a guy that my father does not like all that much. It’s uncomfortable when we are all three together. My boyfriend and I have a great relationship. My father and I have a great relationship. The two of them do not. Enough backstory. There is no fricking way I’d insist that my father be at the birth of my boyfriends child. It is essential that the baby’s father have an intimate time with the mother and the newborn. It is not about the mother only; it is about the new family. OPs father in law has been awful to him. OP is not the asshole here. Edit: I posted this before I read all the other responses. I see that NTAs are being downvoted like crazy. Well whatever. Bring it on. Like I said, I’ve got experience with pushing a baby out my vagina, and with family situations in the delivery room. My vote stands. "
3,aorwnz,t2_29o9o77l,Stardust68,"NTA. This is your first child together. It's sad that your wife doesn't see that she married you to start a life and family with you. No reason why her parents can't come visit after delivery. But it seems like it should just be future mom and dad in the room. I believe most hospitals have a policy on how many people can be in the delivery room. Lack of space, things can happen quickly or emergencies, etc. Maybe if you explain how important it is to you to be able to share this with your wife, she will understand. If that's what it's about. If it's just because you don't like her father, you are going to have to suck it up. She is choosing what she wants over your feelings. I don't think that she gets to be the sole person to decide. You are married and should make decisions together."
3,ak0zkc,t2_npcu11l,mathxjunkii,"Yeeeaahhhh YTA. Not for complimenting how great your waitress had been to her manager. Don’t get it confused here. Your date didn’t think it was rude of you to want to, in general, give some nice feedback. What was rude was: A. You asked to see the manager, and the waitress clearly communicated that she was worried this would be a complaint, and instead of reassuring her and saying “oh no! Everything was great, I want to tell your manager!” You just repeated that you wanted to speak to the manager..... that poor waitress probably had a whole panic attack on the way over to get him. B. You made it some big song and dance to give positive feedback. Positive feedback is nice, and if your server was particularly exceptional, and you happen to run into the manager on your way to the restroom, or he walks by your table, pointing out how great your server is might be a nice thing to do. But making it into some big production (and please refer to part A for how that all went...) was really sort of arrogant. Also (and this piggy backs on part A)- you used your position as a customer to exercise power over the waitress. Which is a huge red flag for your date. You knew your waitress would need to go get the manager if you asked. You know that when someone asks to speak to a manager there’s usually a problem. You knew that this waitress was worried that you were going to make a complaint about her. Instead of considering how she felt you decided to continue to exercise your power as the customer by ignoring her question, and giving her the exact same command a second time. Your date saw in you a very manipulative little blip. A momentary red flag that told her you understand positions of power, and whether your intentions are good or bad, you intend to exercise your power with little regard to those at your mercy. Your date also saw a man who uses a certain type of gesture to impress a woman. “Let me exercise my power and then ultimately compliment the little guy.” It was all one big flex for you, and mildly patronizing for the waitress, you made her feel helpless and then gave her a pat on the head. Not caring how that waitress felt having to go get her manager, and making it this big show, demonstrated a severe lack of class. Zero regard for others, doing good deeds intentionally with an audience. It’s just all bad.... it’s all red flags. EDIT- it seems like others are really covering the basis here with everything I said in my comment. So I guess I’ll offer a little advice to you. If you like this girl, like you *actually* like this girl, and *genuinely* want to be with her and you want to fix this you need to do 2 things: 1. Admit to yourself that you fucked up during this date. Reflect on that. Try and understand how that waitress felt. Evaluate your thought process when you were going through it and realize that either you were trying to be a big shot, or you had absolutely 0 foresight and ended up looking like an ass. And then fix whichever one of those you conclude to be the problem, and promise yourself you’re going to be a little more conscientious from now on. 2. Call your date, and tell her you fucked up. Admit that you wanted to impress her. Tell her you really like her, you wanted to impress her, and you don’t know why you thought that situation was acceptable. Admit to fucking up. Admit that you wanted to compliment the waitress for her service and went about it horribly and ended up using her as a pawn in your quest to do a good deed. And tell her that you understand how big of a tool she must think you are now. Ask her for one more chance, a date, your treat, on her terms (whatever she wants to do- within reason, obviously, this isn’t fair game to be made into a door mat). And hope that she sees some sort of redeeming quality in that. In all honesty- if this is the only situation that you two have ended up in where she left thinking you were a big douche, you should be able to bounce back from it with some honest self reflection and a genuine apology/explanation. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_260b1qxk,totem-spear,"YTA - power trip! It happens, the booze combined with new exciting company. You miss judged the situation, if you like the date, message her that you understand what you did wrong and you just got carried away with the great time you were having. You tried to impress but missed the landing. Acknowledgement of that will get you back in the good books or she probably ain’t the right one for you"
3,ak0zkc,t2_101pe3,nobel32,"Put yourself in her place, and you'll probably begin to realize why YTA. I'd have been worried sick, if I were instructed to fetch the manager with the customer going ""nope"" at me. And I haven't even ever served a dish in my life. There's this concept here in my country : your date's probably going to treat you the same way he treats his waiters. So it's no big surprise your girl couldn't help but get rubbed the wrong way from your ""clever"" ruse. Honestly, we live and learn, mate. I suggest apologizing to the inconvenienced, and moving on. It's frankly not worth all the brain cells being burnt on it."
3,ak0zkc,t2_lb0pb,free_will_is_arson,"YTA. you may not have intended to be an asshole (which is itself the trademark of an asshole) but you certainly went about it the way an asshole would've. you could've wrote a note on the bill thanking her by name for her great service, management would've seen that. you could've just left an online review. you could've even just left a larger tip than what you were going to. they usually have comment cards for exactly this type of situation. instead you decided to make a bit of a show about it - serious at first, but wait, no it's actually good news. you could've clarified when you asked the second time that it was positive but instead you wanted it to be a surprise, a special moment for your server that she would be grateful to you for giving her. something for her to remember you by, specifically you. id call that pompous at the very least. the other alternative is that you seriously don't see how the way you went about it was pretentious posturing, if you wanted this to just be a little moment than you wouldn't have purposefully drawn out making your point. the real problem with what you did is that you tried to steal back your gratitude, the point to giving accolades to someone for doing a good job and working hard is that you are acknowledging them, *their efforts*. what you were scheming for was after your thank you wanted a '...no, sir, thank *you*'. that's what made you an asshole."
3,ak0zkc,t2_2f8krmr6,gottabkind,"YTA. Seems like the only reason to deliver a compliment this way is to watch the waitress squirm. I can’t blame your date for being turned off watching you take pleasure in making someone worry they’re gonna be in trouble at work. It comes across as a pathetic display of power over someone who’s already subservient to you. Funny to you maybe, because you’re in control of the situation and don’t have anything to lose. Not true for the poor waitress. I guarantee you this girl has already been on plenty of dates with guys who think being a dick to a server, even passively, is some sort of power move that’s supposed to impress her. She was right to call you out on it. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_178m2o,shaggy1452,"I didn’t think you were the ass hole at first, but after reading some of the comments i’m gonna go with YTA. Why would you do the faux angry customer routine? She probably thought she was gonna have to deal with some bullshit customer who’s gonna go off and potentially lose her job. I know that might seem like worst case scenario but i’ve known many restaurant managers who’ll give you the axe over customer complaints."
3,ak0zkc,t2_ssmo1,The_Perfect_Dick_Pic,"YTA. It’s one thing if you know someone and you pull their leg. They know you’re not a total dick and that if you’re legit pissed off, you can talk about it and smooth it out. When you do this to a stranger, they have no idea what your intentions are until you drop the punchline, but that wait is an eternity and the pay off is incredibly small compared to the negative feeling. Imagine walking up to a stranger, acting like you’re going to punch them, then smiling and putting your hand up for a high five. How is that stranger to know you aren’t going to haul off and deck them? How does that stranger know you’re not just getting off on fucking with them? You could walk up to your friend, pretend like you’re going to hit them and they’d think “Weird, OP usually isn’t the type for mindless violence, what’s going on?” Then you go for the high five and you’re friend is all “That’s the OP I know. Had me going there!” People have to feel safe with you before you can scare them and make it funny. And another thing, apologizing for something when you don’t even know what you did (i.e. “whatever I did wrong”) is an incredibly empty gesture. That’s why you got nothing back. If you even have a chance with this woman, it’s in learning what you did wrong, why it was wrong, owning it, and making it right, not just trying to say that you didn’t know and that you intended it to be nice. Good luck."
3,ak0zkc,t2_i5ewt,keltsbeard,"Yeah, YTA. You probably had that server thinking she screwed up somewhere and you were fixing to have her chewed out by her manager. *I'm* an asshole and this is beyond what I'd do. Hell man, leave a bigger tip. They work for the tips, that's what they do. Their manager telling them ""That table said you were on point"" does jack shit for them. The reason she looked happy was because her manager was right there beside her, she was on the clock, and not in a place to tell you how much of a jackass you were."
3,ak0zkc,t2_hzowf,comalicious,"YTA. I'm kind of in the middle on this one. I too like the compliment excellent customer service, but do I grandstand? No. I calmly ask whoever served me if there is a way I can go a little bit above and beyond what I'd normally do to make sure their boss knows they did an excellent job. If I'm at a restaurant, I personally thank them and leave them a fatty tip. (and I might call in or fill out a survey on their behalf if that is available). What you did was bring it up in such an abrasive and shitty way that the waitress literally was afraid that you had bad service. You made a scene. Why? Why would you ever do that? What made you think that was a good idea? You literally called attention to yourself, and by extension your date, by using a method often employed by those who are upset with their service in order to ""gotcha"" everybody involved. That's embarrassing. She's pretty spot on here. I think you blew it. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_rcmj1,Gouranga56,"yta a bit . i get you were trying to be playful but you did cause her some stress. It also looks like tou are showing off. Personally when i have been in sinilar situations i will get up myself walk to the manager and tell them. Quiet, non showboating but still you can pay a compliment to the waitress "
3,ak0zkc,t2_j017v,G_Art33,"YTA. You just scared that poor server (weather you meant to or not) to look good in front of your date. Server lose their jobs over dumb bullshit all the time and I’m sure that was exactly what was running through her head. Not shocked your date hasn’t responded yet. Having industry experience when a customer calls for a manager that means something was wrong. she knew this because she asked and I know you knew this because you refused to tell her nothing is wrong. You would be NTA if you had told her “no you were awesome just want to let the manager know how good our experience was”. That would have made everyone happy. You still would get to give your compliment and be NTA, the server wouldn’t be scared shitless that she fucked up without knowing, the manager would know they weren’t going out to a table to comp food and deal with angry people and your date wouldn’t think you were an asshole. That being said - this is one of the better posts I’ve seen on here in a long time. Made me stop and think it through. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_lc6z4kg,UnderApp,"Wow! Really surprised the comments went the way they did. And I wholeheartedly agree. YTA. It's really weird to me that you think it's appropriate to dangle the idea of getting someone in trouble above their head. She even asked you if something was wrong and you fucking ignored her and just ordered her to get the manager again. I know it seems like nothing to you. But this is a huge red flag of controlling behavior. It's like you got some enjoyment out of making the waitress panic, only to swoop in as the hero of your own disaster."
3,ak0zkc,t2_2vtae1bp,Celi_saannn,"NTA. Either 90%of these people have never worked in food industry or have their heads so far up their ass. You complimented your service, sure you could of gone a much better way around it, but no. Cut your losses and find someone else. I've done retail and foodservice. Sure the anxiety isn't great, but it makes my day knowing I provided someone amazing service AND brought it to the attention of my manager. That's how you literally become well liked by management."
3,ak0zkc,t2_2p0wg69t,inathrowfarfaraway_,"Yeah, YTA. The thought was nice, but you absolutely mangled the execution. Not telling her why you asked to see her manager after she explicitly asked if something was wrong seemed like some weird power play on your part. The message you were giving off to the waitress is “I *could*, get you in trouble if I wanted to, but lets just see what happens”. If you told her that she gave great service and you’d like to compliment her to her manager I guarantee your gesture would have been appreciated, but you chose to act like a dick and pretend like you wanted to rag on the poor waitress. That wasn’t happiness you saw on her face, it was relief. I don’t know if you’ve ever worked in service, but imagine how stressed out you’d be if some guy asked to speak to your manager and then just repeated what he said when you asked him why. That’s what people who want to complain do, so obviously you knew it would be taken that way until she came back with her manager. If I were your date, I’d think that you like to manipulate people a little too much for my comfort. Maybe it wasn’t terrible this time, but that behaviour doesn’t bode well for a relationship. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_pbcjc,buell_ersdayoff,"Was leaning towards NTA but the way you kept the waitress in suspense even after she asked if there was anything wrong was kinda douchy at the very least. If you wanted to talk to her manager for the great service, I don't see nothing wrong with that my self but do it after you tipped her well and in private. So in other words, yeah, YTA."
3,ak0zkc,t2_17eaqp,YumeMai,"Okay to all the people getting hung up on how he described the date, specifically the ""good listener part"" - not sure if you missed it or intentionally ignored it, but he also called her smart and charming. Do you know how you find these things out about a person? You converse with them. Furthermore this: >Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. Not sure why people are being so aggressive towards OP, seeing as this was simply a misguided execution of good intentions. He didn't say : I thought if I'd make a show of complimenting the waitress, maybe I'd get a threesome tonight, or someshit. Fucking hell people here just randomly pick a poster and assume the worst. In my honest opinion, OP is NTA. I have no clue whether there was an agenda or an ulterior motive. I can only judge based on given information, and so far all I see is, like I said a misguided delivery of compliments for the staff. Yes you can be more straightforward in the future, but I think all you need to do is apologise for creating unnecessary tension and tell the potential gf that it had nothing to do with impressing anyone and you just wanted to show the waitress deserved appreciation, as that is very lacking in the hospitality business. If she is upset about something else then try to get her to open up and resolve it with her. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_2jm45gq8,NuclearInitiate,"YTA Listen, I'm saying YTA, but this is very minor. I don't even really think overall it's that bad. But I do agree with everyone that you did it in an **extremely** douchebag way. The kind of way that makes me think you've never worked in consumer service, and you might not be very empathetic. Keeping someone on the hook, like the waitress, just wasn't a nice thing to do. She has to deal with assholes all day, was already worried about spilling the water, and generally has enough shit on her plate. Tell her she did great. Leave her a good tip. Even do tell the manager. But just be straight forward about it. **The last thing that girl needs** is to spend 5 minutes worrying about whether you're about to flip and become her #1 asshole customer for the night."
3,ak0zkc,t2_761uu,Mcsmack,"NTA. I get what most of the YTA crowd is saying. But you're fine. These guys like to make it out to be that you were in some power trip and putting this poor waitress into a panic attack or something. As someone who worked for years in the restaurant industry, don't sweat it. Wait staff deal with so much worse than someone wanting to compliment them to their boss. And believe me, they can tell pretty early on what kind of customer you are. Unless she was entirely new to serving, she knew what you were up too. Your date decided that it was some sort of power move made to impress her. Which is really ridiculous. Being nice to the wait staff isn't something you do to impress someone, it's a baseline. It's a thing to do to show that you're not an asshole. Looks like most people here can't grasp that. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_4fkjxln,yavanna12,Unfortunately while your heart was in the right place your execution was lacking. So YTA for needlessly worrying the waitress and for pulling a manger away from their work. In most restaurants there is a number you can call or a website to visit on the bottom of the receipt to give feedback on your service. You could have also just told the girl her service was awesome and asked her how you go about letting her manager know. That would have been the appropriate way to give your accolades. 
3,ak0zkc,t2_cincr,iBeFloe,"YTA x2 for how you described these women & acting condescending. Everything you described about the waitress & girl was *incredibly average & easy to find*. You make it seem as though regular waitresses don’t do their job. Then you made a very normal girl seem like she was the best thing since sliced cheese because... she didn’t talk as much as you did about yourself? “Great listener” “isn’t obsessed with herself” I wonder if you realize that in your head, women who TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES ON A **DATE** are an issue lmao. Back to the waitress, “I would like to speak to her manager” “I calmly repeated” Dude. You were hella condescending. Girl probably got happy that you weren’t about to ruin her & get her fired because you refused to tell her why you needed the manager. It’s extremely clear that you like to seem mighty, but you can’t connect the dots."
3,ak0zkc,t2_2yg3kpdm,mintywavey,"YTA, if you genuinely cared about the waitress’s feelings you would have left a bigger tip and thanked her directly for the excellent service. What you did here was quite obviously a power play and I can see why your date reacted the way she did. You sound like a total douche and there was no reason you had to leave the waitress dangling as to what you were going to say to her manager. You honestly come off as someone who feels he’s superior to service workers"
3,ak0zkc,t2_ay7bv,T_Peg,NTA I'm not really sure where people are getting that YTA sure you did it in a shitty way but it all turned out fine for the waitress in the end and I'm not really sure how your date read that scenario to think poorly of you.

You should have just told the waitress she did a great job, why did you feel the need to cause a big scene about it?? I’d have to agree with your date on this one, sounds like you’re very full of yourself. Maybe next time dial things back to reality a bit; or at the very least get more practice with how to behave appropriately in social situations. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_aocsy,Thousand_Sunny,like tons of other people have mentioned... I wouldn't have asked for the manager in that way because you could've worked up some unnecessary anxiety in the poor lass but I wouldn't say this is enough for you to be called am asshole so I'm going with NTA. My brothers and I have been through sooo many terrible service situations that when we finally receive really great service as you did we tend to feel the extra bit of energetic happiness as well. I would've first tell the lass how great she was and leave a nice tip in her hands. If I was super ecstatic about it that I wanted the manager to know I would've left a note or phone call without the lass knowing but that much is my personal choice
3,ak0zkc,t2_2vgaxekd,reindeer_14,"YTA for the way you pulled the stunt, but also it's good you encouraged the server, I work in customer service and we get rewared when the customers compliment our service, so do that more often but tell the waitress you'd like to compliment her service rather than just asking for a supervisor as if something was wrong."
3,ak0zkc,t2_ku126,HIMADPEOPLES,"My guy. You had to know this would stress your waitress out and that she would think it was something bad. You definitely did this to try to surprise your waitress like ""Oh haha look I made you think this was bad but in reality I was praising you!"" But life isn't a sitcom dude more often the ""haha gotcha"" is just a dick move especially when it comes to things like your job and livelihood. YTA, you should've told her when she asked instead of just repeating it and making it sound like it was bad news. Don't fuck with people's income dude."
3,ak0zkc,t2_2g97121s,georgiadaviesart,"YTA but everyone here seems to be blowing this way out of proportional. You messed it up by not telling the waitress the second time that you wanted to see the manager for a positive reason. That's all. It was a bit of a dick move, but not as wildly as everyone else is suggesting. If something like that happens again, just be honest, especially if it could cause someone else discomfort. Of course, giving great feedback to the manager is always a great idea when someone is excelling. Just don't cause them anguish in the process. Side note: I used to think that was a cool way to do it also because of movies/Gen Y setting awful examples all around me. But no one will rejoice when you give the good news. They focus on the heart attack you almost gave them. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_j4q96,darthphallic,"YTA for a couple reasons. Your description of the girl just screams narcissistic douchebag to me and the whole little show you put on with the server is showboating at its finest. The best (and most normal) course of action would have been to write a yelp (or google) review on the place and specifically name the server for her exceptional service. Employers and owners read that and it will 100% get back to her. Hell, you could have even just left an exceptional tip and that would have gotten the message across. Idk man, if I was serving and someone asked me to take time to pull my manager over just to pat me on the head like a good dog I’d be pretty weirded out, annoyed even if it were a busy night and I had other tables to take care of. Everything in your post leaves a very heavy impression that you think the universe revolves around you and that what you think is hella important to everyone. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_1fa79a,bmf09598,"NTA, and that girl is a C U Next Tuesday. No clue how anybody can say you're the asshole honestly. You complimented a waitress for doing a fine job. I worked in the food service industry in high school and college and I still to this day remember the time a customer went out of their way to tell my boss I was doing a good job. You spend the entire night only hearing from customers if you did something wrong, so for somebody to go out of their way to recognize your good work, that means a lot."
3,ak0zkc,t2_wily2,StorminWolf,"YTA. Plain and simply because you behaved like one then you did not let her know immediately that its a positive feedback you wanted to provide. I take it you never worked in any customer facing position. If some asshole asks to speak to am manager without giving a context about wanting to give positive feedback, its always an extreme stress factor. &#x200B; I hope the girl dumps your sorry ass, as she should not have to deal with an idiot full of himself like you."
3,ak0zkc,t2_15p9jg,theodonkulus,"NTA. I might ve contrarian here but with a girlfriend who works in customer service and friends who work in the restaurabt industry people appreciate that greatly. If anything i think how your date reacted after dinner was a red flag and you shouldnt have apologized for how you did things. You're human, you ddint cost anyone their job but i think you unintentionally bruised your date's ego. Yes you might have come off incorrectly as how you intended but stick to your words ffs. I really think your date isnt as caring and wonderful as you make her out to be. You'll end upspending a lot on pretty little things who just nod and smile as you feed them. That aint much in terms of listening if shes stuffing her face. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_qy1m8mg,imbrownbutwhite,"Oof. I skipped through most of the story to see where the juicy stuff was but after reading the comments and going back and reading the whole thing, good night. Just all the pointless little details and passive aggressive comments about the waitress and the date. The “she was *actually* quite attentative.” Like she’s a fuckin waitress that’s what they do. Or, “Rare quality of not being full of herself.” I dunno who hurt you but YTA. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_1zkgth24,FuckMotherGothel,"NTA - OP, I think you and I can agree that being a writer or waitress is a pretty difficult job and when you find someone who does 110% to meet your needs, they deserve recognition, However, the way you did it was kinda dickish because you made the waitress feel like you were dissatisfied with her service. That aside, if your date wants to be a bitch about you GIVING positive feedback, dont keep pursuing her. You can tell much more about a person in the beginning of a relationship by how they treat waiters, any kind of janitorial staff, or any other individual fulfilling a ""service"" position. When I first met my SO, i realized that he subconsciously cleaned up the table after our lunch and made it very easy to be bussed, he was very polite to our waitress, and I learned after we started dating that he always tipped at minimum 15%. These things alone give me a pretty good idea of what kind of a person he is. I encourage you to stop pressing your date to talk. If she was upset by whatever you did, she would have to have a pretty good reason for me to even consider her seeing her again because that's a really ridiculous thing to get upset over. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_2nx4l1u3,Growupandflyaway,"NTA. People are rrading too much into this. Only you know if your motivation was to be kind or to showboat. I am a server and people do this all the time, granted they are usually older, but it's not like they mean any harm by it. From the fact that she never talked to you again I am guessing there is more to the story to determine if in other areas of your life you are in fact an asshole."
3,ak0zkc,t2_14k5o9,OnionFairy99,"YTA, no doubt in my mind. A lot of people made great points so I'll make this brief, but the execution was incredibly poor. I once thought about doing this same thing. When I was in elementary school with no social skills. As someone with high anxiety and is known for panic attacks, this could have escalated into something horrible for that poor server, and it was incredibly insensitive to do that to her. And after looking over your responses, I can tell you just want to be validated. Well sir, this isn't the right place for that, cause we WILL call you out on your assholes behavior"
3,ak0zkc,t2_1vnbgd0i,Whatchagonnadowhen,"Oh friend. Controlling, full of yourself friend. YTA. And you still don't get it! Some people believe the relief that waitress felt was not worth the heart pounding fear you gave her for however long MR MASTER BURGER JOINT MAN's opinion was in question. So let's recap: 1) Your opinion of a burger waitress matters so much (to you) that... 2) You struck terror in burger waitress in such a way that... 3) You made your self importance completely obvious and... 4) You're not only proud of that, you're mad that someone else isn't impressed by your magnanimity. And unrelated, but... *ask her to be your girlfriend?* That seems...youthful. Your self importance even oozes out of you with your pride in taking date to a burger joint. Which was nice of course, and I shouldn't take this to the extreme I'm about to, because you're not a bad person. But you seem to think that women should be grateful for any interaction you're willing to share with them. I'll still upvote you for asking though!"
3,ak0zkc,t2_2nwg0xkq,Island_universe0,"YTA. I used to work as a waitress and what you did would have made my heart sink and cause me tremendous anxiety. it's kind of show offy to find a manager and tell them their waitress is great even if you don't do it in the weird shitty way you did. It's a little degrading and shows that you think you're above them, instead of equals. You wouldn't do this to someone in a none minimum wage (or close to) roll. But acting like you are going to complain to the manager, and not letting her know that that's not what you're doing when it becomes evident that that's what she thinks it's crazy douchy. You suck."
3,ak0zkc,t2_2s0tpe91,Flappybird11,"YTA, work in a crappy burrito joint, some asshole played this trick on, I made him his crap burrito, he payed for his shit, and he asked for my boss, I just went straight to her and got her, spooked already (I have autism so I tend to make mountains out of molehills and panic over little things) and he did the ""oh he did good"" bullshit on me (honestly that was probably the worst burrito I have made) that whole thing scared me so bad I had to sit in my little corner for 15 minutes to calm myself down!"
3,ak0zkc,t2_316d73lh,BeholdYou_is_my_kik,YTA. For all the reasons everyone has already said. You realise that poor waitress probably spent several minutes completely bewildered and worried because she thought she was going to be in trouble and had no idea why? She probably wasn’t so much pleased at the end as relieved. Not that you care because you just want to show-off. No wonder your date was unimpressed. 
3,ak0zkc,t2_3t2qd2x,bindhast,I think the crowd is getting extra hostile 9n OP. Did he screw up with that lil stunt of keeping his intention secret? Yup. But I think people are gunning him for everything they can lay their hands on. I think he was complimenting his girl by saying she is a great listener- which is actually a very hard skill to have. He also complimented her for being smart and funny. IMHO- it was commendable for him to make sure the waitress’ manager knows she is an excellent employee. This at times can be more valuable than a monetary tip. NTA
3,ak0zkc,t2_ztbew,garmdian,YTA ya ment well but it was little too overboard. Explain to your date that you just genuinely care for good people and want to see them get recognized because that is the right thing to do in a world where people get after you for the small things. Or just too good that works as well.
3,ak0zkc,t2_re7z4,JackoffSmirnof,"YTA but maaaaaaaan it's so close. I think it's been beat to death, but if you had just told her she did a great job and left her a nice tip, it's all the same to her. That being said, your date overreacted a little. She didn't have to go there and make it seem that serious, you were only joking around with the waitress (also, partly I'm sure why she's mad at you, maybe fairly) and meant no ill intent. &#x200B; Much like the Saints, you have a legit beef here but you still aint going to the super bowl. You can add euphemisms for in her pants if you like. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_2mjuoy0y,1MillionIn2019,"NTA Misguided, corny, lack of empathy, and stupid, but not an asshole. You shouldn't have dangled the compliment like that even if you thought ""everyone loves a surprise."" This might flag you as ""could be an asshole, so look for more signs"" but this encounter alone does not make you an asshole. However, i will say that the girlfriend here could be labeled as an asshole. The passive-aggressive ""was *that* supposed to impress me"" instead of being direct about what you did wrong is borderline. But ghosting someone is immature and asshole behavior. Unless you fear for your safety, you should be mature enough to tell someone if you don't want to talk to them and should probably let them know why. Ghosting is 10 year old kid's behavior."
3,ak0zkc,t2_jahab,iRepth,"I read your post and expected to see a stream of people bitching about how obvious it was that you are NTA. You are NTA. I don't know if none of these people ever worked in the restaurant industry before, but I did for many years, and whenever people asked to see the manager I was always happy to oblige. Positive feedback direct to the boss often goes a long way. Though very rarely, sometimes when I'm out to dinner I will also ask to speak with the manager to praise the server for providing exceptionally good service. Your mistake was apologizing to your date after she was rude to you when you'd done nothing wrong in the first place."
3,ak0zkc,t2_2nvigvrd,Misskwy,"NTA in my humble opinion and I do not understand why everyone is whining about the surprise you pulled to the waitress. I think it's a smartass move, yes, but I also appreciate that kind of humour. I've had customers do this to me when I was a manager, telling how my employees were doing a great job. I loved it and so my employees, after those few seconds of dread of 'oh dear, am I in trouble?' and then everyone had a laugh about it. You people need to chill, jeez."
3,ak0zkc,t2_7i4vc,hallgod33,"NTA, only way I could see it being YTA is if you were responsible for holding someone's hand and managing their emotional responses to things at every second. The benefit a good server gets from a customer telling the manager overrides any ""bravado or braggadocios behavior"", you just secured her 10-20% more earnings over the next month at the very least. If the date doesn't respect that, she's clueless to life and how people need to work hard to earn things. It SHOULD impress her, imo, cuz it doesn't matter if you did it like an autistic kid, you still did something great for that server. She proly feels like you shit-tested her or was spreading around your affection. A fat ass tip doesn't do nearly as much as someone thinks unless they're literally tipping 200%. No one's fucking 20 bucks makes that big of a difference. Informing the manager makes a real difference. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_2031qqpo,NifflerOwl,"Gonna go against the grain and say NTA. Yeah, you should have told the waitress you were getting the manager to compliment her, but that was just a dumb mistake. Also I think you were fine when describing the girl. ""Great listener"" doesn't automatically mean they don't talk, it means that they know when to talk about themselves and when to respond to you. If you had genuinely good service then it's not bad to tell the manager. And everyone saying he should just tip: he probably did, but telling the manager she did a good job will probably get her a promotion sooner. "
3,ak0zkc,t2_13g3ky83,kmtitus,"NTA, depending on actual tone of the back and forth i could see why your date is not impressed. Your date probably wanted your attention and a tip with kind word would have sufficed for the (imo - normal service). Doesnt make you the a hole for saying something nice to soome though. Just that i see why your date wasn't impressed"
3,9wzmtq,t2_10sewh,1738_bestgirl,"The lesson to learn here is when people are being idiots in cars don't idiot back at them. The have all the experience being an idiot. So the whole reason you didn't want to let her in was because you were trying to not miss a show. I'm sure waiting for the cops to come around and talking to them made you miss the show. Luckily you don't have a nice car and the driver of the other car was probably doing something illegal (stolen car, drunk, drugs, no liscense, warrents) so they left. But if it had been a vindictive person you could have ended up hurt, in an expensive legal battle, even dead. YTA- not worth it man."
3,b2x3uj,t2_cdibl,cutekittensmeow,"YTA - I'm sorry you're taking the passing of your grandmother so hard and that your parents split at the same time. It sucks. I get it. It all felt like it was piling on. Divorce often follows a major loss for a variety of reasons and it just hurts family members so much more. But you don't get to tell your grandfather how to mourn or refuse to let him move on because you can't move on. You shouldn't be punishing him or his girlfriend because you're struggling. These are people who's feelings matter too. It's been over a year since your grandmother passed. I'm sorry but it's time to let your grandfather have a normal life. Moving on is healthy and normal. I would understand if it was still only six months later and the relationship was still new but they've been together for awhile now. This girlfriend is a part of his life and is important to him. I don't want to tell you how to mourn or how to process your loss but you really need to talk to a professional. It's not healthy to hold onto pain this long. You're only going to hurt yourself and your family if you don't find closure. Please, for your own health, get help so you can stop letting your pain make you be the asshole. "

Blocked him immediately after sending that message. The psycho ended up messaging all my relatives and threatening them, demanding to know who I was with, etc. I am all for rubbing it in his face that you are happy now.

You could absolutely talk to him about it privately and respectfully so he can understand where you're coming from. I'm not sure what you mean by ""calling him out."" When I hear that, I assume it means calling someone out publicly and ridiculing them, which certain situations do call for. However, it sounds like your goal is to have him understand and respect where you're coming from. If you don't really know this kid that well, he might not be that receptive to a conversation about it, in which case I would say just keep silently judging because it wouldn't be worth the confrontation."
3,adrfbl,t2_1e6tmurj,TheCheekyTrollop,"NTA. You tried to resolve this reasonably with the kids and with their parents. They ignored you and kept endangering your child and your property. The inevitable happened. Maybe now these kids will learn the lesson that actions have consequences, a lesson their selfish, negligent parents have been unable or unwilling to teach them. The kids saw that their ball had broken your window and scattered. They didn’t take any responsibility for their actions, didn’t even come to knock on your door to apologise, they were trying to climb over your gate to sneakily retrieve their ball and run off. When you approached them, they simply demanded their ball back, again, no apology even!"
3,adrfbl,t2_e53tmjo,throwawayaccount6622,"YTA. Though I can undertsand you were justifiably pissed off, but this wasn't the right reaction. As others said, you should have kept the ball, gone outside to tell them something to the effect of ""I am very, very unhappy at what you just did. I have repeatedly told you not to play ball outside my house because I knew you would end up causing damage. You have broken my window and the ball also hit \[name of daughter\]. So I'm keeping the ball and will be talking to your parents"". That way, they would have been punished by you by keeping their ball until you see their parents. And presuming the parents are not massive assholes, they will be very apologetic about the broken window and that your daughter got hurt (maybe they just thought you were being over the top thinking that this situation would happen). That would enable them to punish the kids, pay for the window, get their kids to apologise to yours, and tell them not to do it again. If this doesn't stop them, get legal advice on what you can do about the situation. THEN you can wage war on the parents, not the kids who frankly are too young to have even understood why you didn't want them playing ball in the first place. I remember being a child playing outside and not understanding some adult's frostiness towards us, and remember just thinking they were horrible people. Your issue is with the parents, not the kids, not beyond telling them off and keeping the ball until further notice. Edit: typo."

From the sounds of it, things weren't going to change. Dealing with the kid's stuff from across the street is annoying enough, but when he's even trying to climb your fence to get on *your* property, and then the huge thing with the window... no. What you did was still overboard. But honestly from the sounds of it the parents aren't doing enough, and who knows if they might even try to fight paying the window... So to the people saying that them paying it would be enough, idk, maybe what you did will shock the kid into listening at least"
3,adrfbl,t2_ef8i4p,westwestmoreland,"NTA - and I’m genuinely horrified that half of reddit seems to see things differently. Actions have consequences. They were told multiple times, but this time it broke a window and injured a child. They’re lucky you aren’t going after the parents for the cost of the window and medical bills. I think the entitled parent-ness that I see on this thread is exactly why r/childfree not only exists but gets more and more popular. "
3,adrfbl,t2_2r2x81rp,I_run_Arch_BTW,"YTA. Yeah, he destroyed your property and ignored your warnings. He's a kid. You should've done something like ""you'll get your ball back once you apologize to my daughter and organize some way to pay back the damages"". Obviously he's a kid and wouldn't have much money but then he would have to get from his parents or pay you back over time. Destroying his ball in front of him definitely wasn't appropriate. To be clear, his parents were assholes too for not controlling/disciplining him properly. When I was a kid, if another parent complained to mine about something I did, I was terrified because I knew they would take the other parent seriously if I was actually guilty and discipline accordingly. In this case the parents didn't bother. They should've had to pay for the window and you should've made the kid do chores or something for his ball back."
3,adrfbl,t2_16rdjzx8,ReddiStediGo,NTA but also the asshole I totally understand why you cut their ball in half but you could of done it another way such as walking to his parents house and speaking to their parents then the parents would of most likely took the football off him for awhile and they would give it back at a later date

I bet the only reason the turd burgler came back to ask for the ball is because he hadn't told his parents he broke your window and hurt your kid and he knew that if he came home without the ball the parents had given him for Christmas they would want to know what happened to it.

I’m sure I’m going to get a lot of shit for this, but you requested multiple times for them to watch where they kick the ball. Boo hoo. It’s a $15 soccer ball. How about the cost of the window and potential stitches for your kid. The endorphins that must have hit your brain when you stabbed that ball —- makes me a bit envious. "

For the record, all bodies are different and there is no one style of eating that works for everyone. Everyone's optimal macros are different.

I don't think it's your fault that the daughter's relationship didn't work out - sounds to me like she's been damaged in some way previously and is putting up walls to ensure it doesn't happen again. It sucks to be excluded out of a dynamic like that, especially when you appear to have gone out of your way to try and make sure she lives a good life. But that all being said, I think you have every right to kick the daughter out of your house that you paid for, you should just accept that if she goes it'll probably take the mother with her. It sounds to me like you want to keep one and kick the other out, against both their wishes, which is where you became the asshole. It appears very selfish to me, as you have decided your own immediate happiness is more important than the long-term happiness of the daughter and the mother combined. I feel like a better method here would be family counseling, so that you could ask for the respect you feel entitled to, and air your grievances, and the daughter could do the same, and hopefully you could come out of it with some actual familial bond instead of whatever messed up, dysfunctional relationship you appear to have now."

I would say you and your wife need to come up with a said move out date. Make it reasonable. U will feel better knowing there is a date. Your missus and the girl will be more understanding as they have some time to prepare. You’ve dealt with this for awhile so be just a little more patient. You will seem much more reasonable and it will go smoother. Set it up for say 90 days. U will have to make it clear that you will go to legal eviction if necessary. I would say watch and wait.

Then you know what your going to have to do. I would go to the police or legal paperwork and get it started At 60 days as usually u have 30 days after legal notice. This is u sticking to your 90 days. That’s plenty of time to look, save, and start collecting stuff for a first place. If your missus wants to give some her shit away to the youngster and buy new for her and you I would give this a pass and not make it an argument unless it’s really pricey. Or say well u can give it away but when we buy new I’m going with you to pick and there will be a budget. That will keep the missus from giving away everything! Decide if the item in question is really worth fanning the flames of a fire. remember your missus wants or is enjoying her there too.

I get that insecurity is a common problem and I can understand wanting to be considerate of your partner’s feelings, but I would never approve of neglecting your existing relationships over a partner’s insecurities. They are people too. They have been your friends a long time and if I find it shallow and disrespectful to dismiss all of that because your partner lacks trust. This may be a case where you have to decide to leave the relationship behind, but if it comes to that and you find another partner who is not as strict but has somewhat similar feelings, please don’t abandon your friends just to meet their approval."

For a child on the spectrum a wedding can be a total sensory overload, and for an engaged couple wedding day is a memory FOREVER. You never can gage how extreme a meltdown could be. A little interruption is one thing but sometimes kids on the spectrum can get downright violent if they’re too overwhelmed and can’t escape from it.

My brother and SIL did that, their flower girls and ring bearer were allowed to stay (kids of a close friend), but other than that no kids and they wouldn't budge even for family). I understand you want your nephews there, but honestly I feel like you will invite bigger trouble by excluding MOH son only because it could be read that you don't like her son because of his autism.

It’s the maid of honour and extremely disrespectful to expect her to find someone else to care for her kid and be there for you guys and everyone else is welcome. The kid is a nightmare it sounds like but it’s just really bad taste to single out one kid because of being on the spectrum and seems like that in itself would cause drama. Your fiancé is right.

3,b9zxxj,t2_3j1zh316,HangingOnAMoment9,YTA if only the maid of honors kid gets singled out and disinvited.

Is it possible that for the parts that need to be recorded, and memorable parts you could arrange for a caretaker to take him to another section of the venue? He might enjoy himself more in an environment he's not forced to sit and watch you come down the aisle and the long ceremony part, but maybe he can still feel included being there for the mingling? If is dad isn't in the wedding part but invited, if you communicate your concerns calmly before hand maybe he can be prepared to remove him in case of outbursts? I'm not sure how realistic that is, but I don't think too many kids are going to be upset about not being at a wedding in 20 years, it might be worth it to go no kids to keep peace and save friendships."

Cutting off contact may be the only thing that allows parents to see reason, since it completely eliminates their platform for unreasonable requests and shitty opinions. It may not be abuse, but it's 100% harassment and they as adults do NOT have to tolerate that. Op, you do NOT owe anything to your foster parents. Sure, they took you in as if you were they're own, but that means taking on the responsibility to raise you to adulthood. After that is fair game. You go off on your own, as an adult, and may make a life for yourself with or without your foster parents (entirely up to you). Some people continue to see their foster parents, some don't. Sounds like they need to ""wake up and realise"" that you're an adult, you're wife is an adult, and you make decisions for yourself now. Wifey can keep her job and her autonomy.

They don't deserve grandchildren, no one deserves anything related to other people having a child, but it seems unlikely, based upon my own experience and experience others have shared in other subs, that they will ever realize that. Some may say it is an overreaction, and they aren't exactly wrong, but sometimes when people constantly hound you over things they can't wrap their heads around, you have to take an extreme action to get them to lay off. I'd give it time, maybe a week, maybe a month, maybe until the next holiday your family gets together, and tell them you want to see them but they need to respect your decisions and not hassle you over it."

If so you need to exhaust that route before anything else. Again I don't know your countries legal system, but in the US this wouldn't be something to involve the police in. Instead you'd probably file something with small claims court or report the company to a consumer protection agency. &#x200B; Edit: Just realized you compared it to Craigslist, I was thinking it was more along the line of Wish or something with third party sellers.

There's nothing wrong with confronting someone about a lie they've been repeating to you. Further, the reason she keeps ghosting you is because she knows she's in the wrong and doesn't want to have to face the consequences or guilt. She would rather run away from her problem than dealing with it. &#x200B; BTW The situation as I see it, she likes you emotionally and physically. But she finds her friend more physically attractive, she doesn't see him as a long term possibility, as he is prob a bit of an asshat because of his good looks, and wants you as her backup when she is ready to leave him. Don't fall for this, and don't take her if she comes to you, she'll likely cheat on you in your relationship from all of the red flags shown up to now. She has a bit of a narcissistic personality (armchair psychologist, take that with a grain of salt) and she will choose what she desires over commitment.

3,audeqz,t2_2dzsp6uu,Lalabeth93,"YTA. Your friends are right to be shocked because it is cruel. Declawing is so horrible. You would be cutting the top of a cats finger off, not the nail, the actual finger. Decline comes with a bunch of health risks to. Cats can end up with chronic pain and end up with difficulty walking. Their feet get so sensitive that they can't walk in a litter box so you'll end up with a cat goes to the bathroom all over the house. You're removing the first line of defense so you could end up with a cat who bites and it's a lot more aggressive. And it doesn't matter if there indoor cats they do need to defend themselves against other cats against you and if they can't swat, they will use their teeth."
3,audeqz,t2_m8sd4t1,Christwriter,"YTA Or rather YWBTA. It deliberately cripples kitties because their owners can't be arsed to learn kitty behavior. If you are concerned for your furniture, buy a log with bark on it. If you are worried about scratches, learn why cats scratch and don't do their triggers anymore. You also need to be aware of the HUGE impact declawing has on a kitty. First, they will be in considerable pain. A declawed cat no longer has use of its declawed toes, as all methods of declawing severe the tendons, so a declawed cat walks on their ""heels"", something those bones aren't designed for. That often causes early onset arthritis. The law pads operated on often become hypersensitive, making scratching and digging behavior too painful. Which means all your litterbox training goes down the tubes. The most common method of a declaw, amputating the toe bone at the first knuckle, commonly leaves fragments of the nail bed in the paw. These fragments grow without an outlet and cause considerable pain by themselves, sometimes even puncturing the paw pad. Finally, there is the psychological impact of losing their claws. This is their first line of defence. Without it, they become anxious and fearful. Some cats become aggressive and prone to damaging bites. Others become timid and hide under the nearest safe object. They believe that if anything attacks them they will probably die. Any behavioral problems that existed before the declaw will grow exponentially. The end result of a declaw is an animal with serious special needs. They need special physical care, an understanding owner who can handle potty accidents and an environment that makes them feel safe and secure. Most owners cannot handle this, and a declawed cat is far more likely to be abandoned at a shelter than a clawed one. You can cap kitty's claws or give them a regular manicure. But please, if you cannot handle a couple scratches and claw marks on furniture, for the cat's sake go get a fucking gerbil. "
3,audeqz,t2_1h6cb5xq,t40rn,Sorry I'm late. Yta for even thinking about that. Honestly you may want to consider learning about cats online and from books.

3,audeqz,t2_2uyprrg,HailCrystals,"YTA. Please, *please* don't get them declawed! Declawing is incredibly painful for cats, they remove the *bone* when they declaw, it's awful, and can cause your kitties pain :( Watch Jackson Galaxy's video on why he doesn't advocate for declawing cats. If you are having problems with them scratching things etc. there are plenty of safer steps that you can take! I know they don't need to use their claws to hunt prey, but that's part of their nature. That would be like removing a fundamental part of human nature from your body that makes you who you are. I just saw your edit, I'm really glad you've reconsidered.

I think that is one of the most common reasons for adoption failure. If you Google rad in adopted kids adoption failure you will find lots of articles on the topic. OTOH people will make moral judgements about you wanting to return the kid but OTOH these people arent at risk of being murdered in their sleep by their child. Do what you need to do.

She looked me dead in the eye and said ""Sometimes I hate her too. Every parent has moments like that. You can't blame yourself for feeling that way sometimes. Ultimately your actions are all that matters."" You aren't the asshole for feeling the way you do. For what it's worth I ended up fucking up that relationship because I had undiagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder, it's ""curable"" as much as that word can be applied to any mental based issues. The mind can only learn programing on top of existing programming, the previous programming still exists, we just learn to override it and with time and effort we can learn to override it faster and have more contingencies in place, but it can only be done one step at a time and even once new, more desirable, behaviours have become the default reaction to situations the old programming still exists and may come out. I am unfamiliar with RAD and all of its challenges, but if after therapy its better, even for a short while, that leads me to believe that progress can and will be made, bit by bit. Does the therapist have any advice on how to respond to outbursts?"
3,a3vjz3,t2_5jquo,Coziestpigeon2,"NTA for how you're currently feeling and possibly how you'll deal with the situation. I can't imagine being in your place and having to deal with something like this, and absolutely don't think you're an asshole for how you're feeling or for what you might need to do. YTA for going through an adoption without being ready for this kind of outcome. It's like a (much more) extreme version of the kid who gets a puppy before realizing that they need to take it for walks and pay for vet appointments and train it not to destroy shit. Your situation sounds awful, but it also is not that exceptional or rare. I don't know if you just never expected this as a possibility, or if you just weren't truly ready for it to be as bad as it is, but damn. This was your responsibility to learn and prepare for before adoption. Now this kid's life is, arguably, on a worse track than it would have been if he was just left at the orphanage. Again though, with the situation being what it is, I don't think you're an asshole, and I do think you might need to do something drastic in order to make your situation safe at home again, and that wouldn't make you an asshole either. I honestly wish you the best of luck, and can't imagine having to be in your shoes. I hope you're able to make it to the other side of this alright. "

You had no control over what went into that fetus body before birth, nor how he was raised during his most formative years. He was in a different country in a very different culture. The RAD diagnosis is is rough. It can lead to severe consequences for the entire family, and if you as a parent feel that you are not safe, in your own house, and you are no longer able to raise this child, you are justified in returning him to an environment where he can get the professional care he needs."
3,a3vjz3,t2_2ayzcos,Car_the_boat,Gonna get down votes but NTA at all. In fact I would go as far as to say you would be justified in returning him. It's easy to judge from the outside but potentially 10+ years of this? That's really damn rough. You are going to need some damn near superhuman self Control. Either he'll get better or be one of those kids who grow up to have serious issues and shoot up a school or something. It'll be shitty to leave him but honestly in time you won't care nor anyone on this sub.
3,a3vjz3,t2_x6cdp1k,SquirrelGirlVA,"NTA. Look, you're emotionally and physically exhausted. Sure, the thought has crossed your mind to give him back but it's just that - a thought. Nowhere in this have you actually shown any indication that you'd actually give him back. Venting is fine and healthy. If there's a forum that has a group of people who also have experiences with children with RAD, it would definitely be good to form a support group there with them. I also highly, highly recommend finding more IRL support. Talking online is good and still an outlet to vent, but you need people around you to help provide support. It sounds like you have some people in your life but not many that could fill this role. This by itself will make the load a little lighter, a little more bearable, even if just slightly - and sometimes getting that slight relief in itself makes a huge difference. You're not a bad person. A bad person wouldn't adopt a child needing a home and spend countless hours and monies trying to get said child help when he started exhibiting problematic behavior. Let me say that again. ***YOU'RE NOT A BAD PERSON***. A bad person would not have done what you've done for him or reach out for comfort - and that's what you're doing here, you're looking for comfort and reassurance so that you don't lash out at the child. And again, there's nothing wrong with having feelings like this. You need to work through them, sure, but you're in a situation where you're just exhausted emotionally and physically. A lot of people don't know what that's like - and honestly, they should count their blessings. I've never experienced exactly what you're going through, but I've had other family issues and experienced some things that just left me feeling utterly depleted. You're normal, OP. You're a human being and it's OK to wish that you could walk away from everything."
3,a3vjz3,t2_11w5uk,Bellowery,"NTA My husband has a godson who was adopted after 4 biological kids. He was exposed to a shocking amount of alcohol in the womb. At the point that his adopted mom was locking her four oldest children outside in the sleet in January because he was so violent they realized he needed more than they could give him. They had him placed in therapeutic foster care and he was doing great but DHS will no longer pay for him to be in care. They are putting him back up for adoption and making sure they choose a family that knows what he needs and is able to provide it. They didn’t know the extent of his FASD when they adopted him and nobody told them how bad it could be. He was 2 the first time he ripped a door off the hinges. His biological parents are very very tall, his adoptive parents are not. At 3 he was taller than his 6 yr old brother. They could not create a safe place for any of their children. This is probably the hardest thing you will ever have to do and a lot of people are going to make you feel like garbage. I hope you can find some help and comfort. Finding him a home where he can thrive and hopefully work past some of this. "

So instead, look at the dramatic nature of this train of thought and realize you need series help for a serious situation. You're exhausted and hurting and at the end of your rope. This is a really tough situation. Someone upline suggested some special resources for families dealing with RAD which sound great, but I wonder if you could find a way to take a weekend off and sleep/rest.

3,a3vjz3,t2_c0po0,nonuniqueusername,"I don't have an answer to the asshole question but you aren't this kid's parent. There is nothing about his post that says you have mentally accepted that he is your son. You only call him your adopted son once in the title to summarize the question. You don't say you love him. You don't sound like you opened your heart to him. You talk about him like he's a teenage roommate. You've had your son since he was THREE. This is YOUR SON. You are his whole world and that is a choice YOU made. Gee, I wonder why he's acting out. Think he can sense all this? My son is 7 and has been kicked out of preschool for violence and kicked out of private school in first grade for violence. Almost kicked out of kindergarten for violence. He hit neighbors' kids until their parents refused to let them play. No one ever suggested giving him up for adoption. It never crossed our mind. Because he's OUR SON. We did occupational therapy, some psychiatrists, and a 5mg daily dose of Adderall. He's always been an angel in my eyes but now everyone else sees it. Now he's in scouts, jiu jitsu, soccer, and basketball. He had a ton of friends and reads like lightning. I'm not saying ""hang in there and it will get better."" I'm saying ""maybe if you start actually loving the poor SIX YEAR OLD YOU ARE THINKING OF DEPORTING you might see him stop acting like a SIX YEAR OLD WHOSE MOTHER DOESN'T LOVE HIM AND WANTS TO DEPORT HIM."" I guess I can't answer the asshole question because it's invalid. ""AITA for wanting to deport my son?"" doesn't work because you would never deport your son. You don't see him as your son. Side note: I hope you have been aware during all the separate families and deport children at the Mexican border that you have no room to talk. I went and looked up RAD.

3,a3vjz3,t2_sz43n,theanamazonian,"YTA - What if if was your biological child who had a mental health issue? Would you just abandon them too? You agreed to take that child as if it was your own when you adopted him, for good or bad. From a personal standpoint, my parents fostered a lot of kids when I was growing up. We took them until they were 18 and made them a part of our family...if they wanted to stay after 18, there were ground rules, but they were allowed. For better or for worse, these are still my siblings. One of those kids was taken out of foster care and adopted into a family because they thought he was a ""cute kid"". He was so incredibly excited to have a family. The adoptive parents ignored everything that my parents had to say about the behavioral issues and the mental health issues. They kept him for a couple of years, treated him like crap, and then when the behavior issues surfaced, they returned him. It created so many additional issues for him and he ended up in a really bad place in his life as a result. Thankfully, he has been able to turn his life around and is doing well now, but he still deals with various abandonment issues. This is a child that you are talking about. He's helpless and he's been abandoned and likely had a very difficult first three years of his life. You moved him into an unfamiliar country with an unfamiliar culture. His behaviors are difficult to deal with (I know RAD and I know how tough it can be), but underneath that is a human child who looks to you for all of his basic needs. You are a parent OP, and as hard as being a parent is, you will be able to do this. Find a way to love this child. He needs it."
3,a3vjz3,t2_o6s5nlg,NotAQuiltnB,YTA As a retired law enforcement officer I came in contact with a teacher who adopted a child from Russia. The child was adopted by her and her husband as a toddler. He had serious issues as your boy does. She was committed to him and stood by him. Her husband bailed. She dug in her heels and stood bye that child getting all the professional help her salary could buy. I saw that poor lady age and become broken. Finally at 13 she had been physically attacked more times than I can count. She surrendered the child to the state. He broke her down I cannot express to you how much damage was done to this woman and in the end the child was not saved. Remember the directions they give you on the airplane. Put your oxygen mask on first then the person your helping. Normally I would say die for your child but in this case I am afraid it would be all for naught. Get out while you can and forgive yourself for it. Forget anyone who judges you for it as they cannot walk in your shoes. Bless you. 
3,a3vjz3,t2_1345ci,GeishaB,"NTA. That child is a legit psychopath. I don't know about giving him back, but if he isn't put somewhere secure where he can't hurt people, he *will* escalate his violence. Unfortunately, as a caregiver there is absolutely nothing you can do. He was born that way and if he already has violent tendencies it *will* get worse. You have to understand that he has no empathy, he has a God like complex, he's a world class manipulator, he is not afraid of punishment (he doesn't have the capability), and even has a reduced/delayed response to pain. There is no form punishment that can change him. The worse part is, he believes all of his actions are everyone else's fault. ""Look what you made me do"" He needs to be in a facility that can handle his mental state and will keep people around him safe. You have to be cautious how you handle this because he will most likely end up resenting you and your husband. "
3,a3vjz3,t2_68ltn,Cairnwyn,"NTA. I'd like you to consider that plenty of bio-parents fantasize about giving their children up or never having had them in the first place. Plenty of bio-parents *actually* give their kids up or are so terrible to them / neglectful of them that they have their children taken from their care. And, yes, every parent who thinks this feels like absolute shit, but it is in our nature to escape things that are hurtful to us. This is not a good situation for you, so your instincts are to run. Add to the fact that you probably never properly bonded with your child either, and you're left struggling without any of the happy love hormones that you'd have to help you through if you were bonded from birth. This is quite similar to mothers with extreme PPD. Honestly, having known families in your exact shoes, RAD is the biggest reason I ruled out adoption of an older child. I'm not cut out for it. Most people I know aren't cut out for it. I've watched multiple marriages crumble from dealing with RAD kids. Special needs kids of any type are exhausting. You're giving maximum effort for minimal reward every day of your life. You're grieving the parent-child relationship you always wanted to have, but you don't actually have the time to properly deal with that grief, so you just bottle it up and keep pushing forward because your kid needs you. Desperately needs you. And all you want to do is curl up in bed and cry for an hour then sleep for 3 days. I'm sorry your life didn't turn out the way you envisioned. I'm sorry you didn't get your properly bonded baby. I'm sorry your generous and loving heart led you down a path that's full of pain and sorrow. This sucks. It's unfair. I know everything seems endless and overwhelming, but you can make it through with the right support and resources. Your kid may forever be broken, but you don't have to break with him."
3,a3vjz3,t2_mk8p3,iamasecretthrowaway,"NTA. Reactive attachment disorder is a beast. I know *he's* seeing a therapist, but you need someone to talk to too. Someone you can be totally open and honest with and mommy blogs arent going to cut it. You need to be talking to a therapist that has, at the very least, a basic understanding of what his condition entails and what you're looking at in the future. Its actually not uncommon for people to not bond with adopted children and vice versa. And people definitely do ""return"" them sometimes. But you've waited quite a long time. I'm sure in adopting someone after 3 years is a lot different than doing it at 6 months or a year. I think you need to talk to someone who really *knows* about what you're asking (and not just anecdotal knowledge, either). Side note, more people should talk about the unsparkly side of adoption. "
3,a3vjz3,t2_88j6b1n,MatterCaster,"NTA I read somewhere that children with this problem will thrive and improve when they are removed from their first adoptive family and placed in another. So this could be the best thing to do for everyone. Also, the adoption agency had to know this child was troubled, and they placed him with you anyway. In a way, you were victimized. You should not feel obligated to cooperate with their con. I have known people who had to do this. It is not as unusual as you may believe. You are a person worthy of care and concern too. Don't let anyone guilt you into keeping this child. Be kind to yourself. "

Or you or your husband getting a call that hes murdered one of you. It's been three years, you've given it your all. But you gotta realize that YOU have a life to live. People getting angry at you and saying ""its not like adopting a pet"" are idiots and more than likely hypocrites. If your husband agrees to it, just give him back to the orphanage and never look back. YOU didn't bring him into the world, you have no responsibility to bear this nightmare.

Feeling like this doesn't make you a bad person. You \*would\* be the asshole if you \*actually\* gave him back. Remember this kid is not at fault for having after effects of trauma during a very critical stage of development. He's having a really hard time, and he's not doing it \*at\* you. Are you and your husband seeking training for handling a kid with an attachment disorder, or any kind of respite care for him or therapy for yourselves? People do ""give back"" challenging kids they've had for years. I used to volunteer for an organization that worked to place kids with multiple failed adoptions. I was responsible for organizing their profiles. Let me tell you, watching that progression of photographs with the light dying in their eyes over the years, looking at old biographies where the kids had hope turn into biographies where they don't anymore...it's the most emotionally difficult thing I've ever done. You're a parent. That's not something you can really undo, and it confers a sacred duty. When you adopted this kid, he became your kid, not based on what he would or would not return, but based on your commitment to provide for him. It's possible he'll never show love in the way you'd like, and it's possible he'll never be a success in the way you'd imagined. He is still your kid, and your duty is to do what is best for him. That means not adding another broken attachment to his list, and it means finding whatever extra help you can to keep your own sanity so you can continue to do your best without burning out. I hope you find it."

The way you describe your son is pretty similar to how my nephew was except he wasn’t diagnosed with RAD. Instead, he had a food allergy that made him act similar to your son. I remember corn syrup was one of the things he couldn’t eat. His doctor thought my sister was nuts when she told him what she suspected but in the end she was right. As long as she avoided those things he reacted to, he was a completely different child. And, when he did have something he shouldn’t, apples seemed to calm him down. I’m only sharing this in hopes that it might help. My nephew has since grown out of it but when he was young and got some of those foods he wasn’t suppose to it made our lives a living hell.

I don't see the sense in ruining both you and your spouse's lives over a child you seem to be making little progress with when you could have a loving relationship with a different child who needs a home just as badly. This may seem a little cold, but let's do the math. Ask yourself how much difference you're making in this child's life, as compare to living in a foster home. This is what's gained by keeping your current adopted son. Now, ask yourself what difference you could make to a (comparatively) psychologically healthy child, who is currently an orphan, and will continue to be without your intervention. Now, replace the stress, fear and shame of having a child who's outwardly violent and hateful towards you and everyone else, with a healthy, loving relationship that you and your husband get to have with a different child. This is what's gained by adopting a different child. Honestly, this seems pretty simple to me. I plan to adopt, not because of infertility, but because I've always wanted to provide that good to the world, to have that impact on a life, and I sure as hell wouldn't stick with a kid I can't have a loving relationship with. I know there's supposed to be difficulties to parenting, but a child who I can't help from attacking me and destroying his room? Fuck. That. I take care of adults with a variety of disabilities, and all of my clients presented challenges to their parents as children. With one client who is pretty severely autistic, his parents had to deal with a similar situation, bolting things down, building a desk that protects his computer from him, padding their walls, getting hit and scratched, constantly replacing his possessions that he chose to break. I've always considered this to be above and beyond. While I'm glad that they kept him until he was about 18 or 20, I have always believed that what they went through is not fair to ask of any parent."

So while it does suck and I truly hope it gets better for your family, despite everyone else's opinion, I believe you are an asshole and do not love your child."

Keep in mind, the ticket has almost certain doubled if not more due to late fees. But you're being a bigger asshole to yourself. You can legally have your license suspended and/or have a bench warrant issued as a result of just ignoring it indefinitely. Work on saving up and pay the ticket man."
3,allagl,t2_dg0wy,ness839,"**NTA.** I don't often give hard advice like this but if it happens with any sort of regularity, *get out of that relationship*. The biggest red flag to me is her effectively starting the argument with the unnecessary ""she plainly said that she thought the car was girly"" but then turing it around and saying you caused the argument and saying stuff like ""I had the power to fix this but I'm choosing not to"". You also signaled that you didn't want to talk about it anymore and she just ranted at you for that car ride. People who say things like ""you don't have the right to be hurt by this"" are grade-A assholes."
3,allagl,t2_2ha3va7p,super_kami_guru_93,"I’m going with YTA simply because I don’t have more context on what your girlfriend said. But you voiced your opinion about a car. Your girlfriend then voiced her opinion about that car. There are certainly ways in which she could have voiced that opinion in a bad way. Again, I don’t know what really went down. But her claiming the car is girly is acceptable. Her insinuating that you are girly in some way because you like a girly car is a bad thing. But those two things aren’t the same. It seems to me though that you interpreted her response, warranted or not, as her insinuating that you were girly for liking the car. Seems to me like you got defensive here. Which wouldn’t really do much to fight against that “fragile male ego” stereotype. And from your post it seems like this a repeating pattern of behavior. Additionally, how the hell did a simple comment about a car turn into a serious fight? Your relationship needs some work if that’s the case, from BOTH of you. Lastly, beetles ARE girly cars. It’s fine that you like them, but they are more feminine in their design, marketing, and appeal. You need to toughen up a little bit. Admitting that you over react to issues doesn’t excuse you for over reacting to issues. Honestly makes it worse in my opinion."
3,allagl,t2_19742unn,sweet_lemonbrown,"NTA, she doesnt get to decide what you should and shouldn't be hurt by. if something she said upset you whether or not it was her intention, she shouldnt minimize it like that. you're allowed to feel whatever you feel whether she thinks its warranted or not. when you tell someone they've hurt you, they don't get to decide that they didn't. Edit: also wanted to add that belittling and berating someone, especially over something so small is not healthy and is pretty toxic. that's not how you treat someone you care for and love. "

I started to be quiet and just kinda lean towards door of the car and turn my head away. She continued to talk about how I always get hurt by things that I have no right to get hurt by and that she isn't gonna apologize for something she didn't do wrong (I never asked her too, I only asked her to be more sensitive sometimes). She continually got more mad at me for saying that I caused the argument and telling me that I always do this. When we got back to her place I eventually left because I didn't want to argue all night long and I could tell it wasn't gonna stop until I told her that I understand all of what she is saying and that she is right. I haven't apologized but she said I had ""the power to fix this but I'm choosing not to."" &#x200B; NTA. This right here is big red flag. Harping that much on something that is clearly not a big deal is not a sign of a healthy relationship. You clearly wanted the conversation to be dropped and it seems to me that you are more offended that she wouldn't let the subject go than actually being offended by her opinion of the car. &#x200B; Also some versions of the Beetle are girly-er than others but I have seen plenty of men driving them."

You may think it’s going to a familiar island but you will never know until you give yourself the chance to cross it. Until then you’re abandoning yourself as well as your cousin (family who has done nothing wrong to you) on either side which may lead to great things and a good freaking bridge if you just get over this fear. Contact your cousin, tell them your concerns, tell them that if you two have a relationship then that will require them to keep your mom out of it, and finally apologize to them. Some of the best/most reliable people in my life are cousins. Hell, she might be going through similar negative experiences through that side of the family as well and is reaching out to someone they know feels the same. You have to see that if they are truly sincere this is a shitty thing for you to do to someone who had no involvement with your mom being an ass to you"

A sports jacket comes in handy for interviews, but that's about it. I only own two and almost never wear them. **Never owned a suit my entire life and got by just fine and worked in corporations in management.** Personally, unless you are in the wedding party, there's no reason to wear anything nicer than a sweater with a nice shirt under it.

I was recently unemployed (employed now), and looking for a job was a full-time job by itself! If you don’t believe me, go look on r/jobs and r/careerguidance for stories! And during this time, while I was scouring the Internet for jobs 8-6 every day, sending out resumes, and occasionally going on interviews: I barely had time to clean for myself, let alone someone else. So it’s perfectly understandable that after a long day of this, she wouldn’t be up for housework! Furthermore, expecting her to commit to being a homemaker when you JUST MOVED IN with her is not reasonable. It is also very dangerous. What happens if you break up? Or you die (God forbid?). What happens to her? She’s screwed! "
3,a52hhj,t2_s3vvgeq,lurkylurkeroo,"I'm torn here. Why are you the only person cleaning this? He disappears for hours then has the nerve to complain that you hadn't done enough cleaning? It's his damn bog as well, it was his mate that made the mess, he should have been cleaning with you. And he's being a damn brat deliberately antagonizing you by walking around the house with filthy shoes even after you told him not to. I'm going to go with NTA with a tiny bit of YTA in that I think you should have been more assertive (assertive doesn't mean bitchy). Fuck him tho.

3,a52hhj,t2_477coj8,simiwood,Nta you did all the cleaning he should have given you the shoes but you understand to most you where overreacting and its really annoying.

3,a52hhj,t2_4i4ub,Trishlovesdolphins,"NTA, but I also think you're overreacting. What he did was gross and he should have cleaned it up and been more respectful, especially knowing your OCD stuff. But you drew first blood. You called him a pig and demanded shoes. From there he escalated, you threatening to leave if he didn't take off his shoes and not move was too much. So leaving is probably for the best until everyone cools of actually. You both behaved badly and should go to your corners for a bit."
3,ah0a9o,t2_4uil9,xHeero,"YTA. First, a year is long enough of a grieving period to move on and become serious with someone new. Second, she's probably over-nice because she is nervous and really wants to have a good relationship with you. You seem not to like her and resistant to everything about her and your dad's relationship. She probably feels like she is walking on eggshells around you. You have presented ZERO proof that her niceness is a facade. Third....I hate to blow your mind bud, but adults in relationships have sex. If the worst you've found is that they accidentally left a bottle of lube out in their room and that she has lingerie...well my dude...that is nothing. You come across as a kid who can't accept that their parents have split and found different romantic partners."
3,ah0a9o,t2_2a2ea23r,germaniumest,"Yes, YTA. I think you're just resentful that your parents have split up and it's odd for you to see him with someone else so now you're looking for reasons to hate this woman who hasn't done anything wrong. You went into their bedroom on your own volition. Bedrooms are usually pretty private rooms where people keep stuff not meant for others to see. Going through laundry - again, you kind of brought this on yourself. Where is she supposed to put her clothes that need to be washed? And what is stripper underwear? You acting like that is extremely childish. It's not her fault your parents divorced and if she makes your dad happy and treats you nicely then that is all that matters. Don't act like a brat."
3,ah0a9o,t2_25absm1e,boudicas_shield,"YTA. It’s not being “shoved in your face,” either; you’re deliberately snooping around their bedroom and pawing through her laundry. If anyone is gross here, it’s you. Learn some basic boundaries. Man, if anyone came into my bedroom without asking and then whined about seeing my lube on my nightstand, they wouldn’t be invited back into my home. Ditto if I caught them digging through my dirty laundry and inspecting my underwear. Get a grip, OP, and grow up. You’re getting too old to behave this way, and you’d be better off learning that sooner rather than later. "
3,ah0a9o,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,"NTA. It is disgusting. This is one of the many problems with divorce. Instead of parents acting like a parents (as they should) they start acting like teenagers again because they are trying to find a new spouse. In other words, they tend to de-prioritize their children and prioritize finding a new partner. There are only so many hours in the day, and new relationships consume a massive amount of time and resources. Being a parent tends to fall to the bottom of the priority list. This is one of the many reasons I would never get remarried if something happened to my wife. Also, I think you hit the nail on the head. Many stepmothers will act fake nice to the kids in the dating phase, then flip over to who they really are after the marriage occurs. I’ve seen it happen over and over and over. "

We always make sure there are enough bed for everyone (sometimes two singles will have to bunk in the same room, but they each have their own bed for sure), and everyone pays the same price (no discount for being a couple).

3,ag4os8,t2_1xii9vu2,ForeverBlue3,"NTA Couples should be paying the same price per person as single people. That is pretty crappy that he is paying way more already due to just being the only single guy as well as paying extra because some of the friends are on a budget. I'd say they need to suck it up and find a place that is big enough for everyone going to have their own bed. If nobody else is willing to sleep on the floor or a couch, why would they think that OP should have to? Either this or the people who are paying less should sleep on the floor on an air mattress. That makes the most sense since they're paying the least amount. Easiest solution OP, is find yourself a date for the weekend :)"
3,ag4os8,t2_bhqjh,Zenai10,If you're paying for the difference and the others are okay with how they are sleeping then NTA. however if you were not then i totally understand them not wanting to pay for you. I cant really comment properly not knowing the cabins. But if you dont get your own bed what exactly would you be paying for? Surely if you wanted a bed its a simple matter of you paying for your bed and the others paying for theirs. As someone who was on the couple side of this situation hsving to pay an extra 200 on top of what im paying for myself was crazy. But i was only told as we arrived.
3,b9qtbv,t2_3jh4d0fr,buddingredditor,"NTA. At all. Just because someone is family, doesn't mean you owe them anything. But that being said - do YOU want to help him out? There's 2 options - you can be the bigger and better person and help him out and your good karma (life karma not Reddit karma ha) will pay you back when you least expect it... OR you can tell him to get fucked and sort it himself to give him a taste of his own medicine. If his soon to be Ex Wife is as manipulative as you convey, he may not have realised how much of a dickhead he was when you needed him and probably had everything twisted by her. Both balls and brain. And that's something you don't realise until you're out of the situation. Ultimately, it's upto you, but either way, I personally say you wouldn't be TA. "
3,b9qtbv,t2_qp6c5xc,Relick-,"NTA. If you don't want to respond and move on with your life that is your right and you shouldn't feel bad about doing so. That said, his wife could have done a lot to mess with his mind to turn him against you. This could be an opportunity for you to rebuild your relationship with your brother. That he may have been manipulated does not diminish the harm he did to you, or your feelings on the matter. Being manipulated does not absolve him of the harm he has done or his actions during it, its an explanation, not a justification. In the end, this is an opportunity to rebuild something with your brother. Like all opportunities, you can take it or you can leave it, and neither decision would make you an asshole."
3,b9qtbv,t2_74t7ib1,mindlesswreck,"NTA. It's understandable to be angry right now and this is definitely karma coming to get him. However, maybe you can use this time to instead be the bigger man and help him out. He obviously fucked up a lot in the past, but maybe this can be an opportunity for you to reconcile your relationship with your brother. I'm not defending him for how he treated you, but it sounds like he was pretty blinded and manipulate by his wife.

3,b9qtbv,t2_31308r9p,dusty-clementine,"NTA. you gotta look out for #1. he gave you nothing when you were down, he gave you nothing when you tried to help, and he chose someone who hated you over you when you really needed him. do you think he cared enough to take to reddit for advice when the roles were reversed? sometimes family doesn't mean shit - he doesn't deserve you \*scissors emoji\*"

3,b9qtbv,t2_bq5e51t,NefariousNebula,"NTA I get the impression that his ex was abusive. ""Filling his mind with lies"" about you to keep you two distant and gaslighting him throughout the affair (which may have actually lasted these two years) are clear flags of abusive behavior. First thing to do is to talk to your wife. I completely understand why she wouldn't want to help, but maybe you should remind her how important he was in your life once, and if you honestly want to help him escape this poisonous relationship, maybe it would be good for everyone. &#x200B; If she agrees, only offer assistance where it's not going to put you out, like storing his stuff in an unused corner of the garage or helping him look for apartments, but also, see if you can take time to hang out just the two of you. Grab a burger together somewhere and just let him talk. Hopefully he will eventually realize that he was in an abusive relationship and work to become a better person, and brother. Or he might just become a selfish bitch that you eventually need to sever all ties with, but the former is more likely. Good luck! &#x200B;"
3,b9qtbv,t2_1b1torqv,Spider4Hire,"NTA - you can't use ""it is family"" as an excuse to help especially when he didn't follow that concept. On a familiar note, I no longer talk to my brother because his then fiancee filled his head with lies and lashed out on me one day in a way that you can't take back. He obviously had remorse when he found her cheating on him. I cannot accept an apology (5 years ago) from him and stay cordual during family gatherings. He chose to believe someone over someone who he knew for over 20 years, inside and out. I also want to add on that I got married at 20 (by only a month) and still happily married 7 years later. Don't put an age to making ""stupid"" decisions. Everyone makes their stupidest decisions, and their best decisions, at any given age."
3,b9qtbv,t2_a6k64,little_mermarx,"NTA -- At the end of the day, nobody wants to believe their spouse is cheating (sunk cost fallacy and all that business) so in that context, having you drunkenly send texts calling his wife a cheating cunt would probably warrant no contact. I think that's the risk anybody takes when confronting somebody with a harsh reality that they are unwilling to face. Buuuuut she was a cheating cunt and you were just trying to help out your bro. He knows he fucked up your relationship, but it's not your job to try to fix it. You aren't an asshole for not responding, but maybe give it time and consider what long term reconciliation would even look like to you before you try to talk to him, if at all. That way you give him at least the opportunity to make amends but he's not putting it on you, which is what his attempt to contact you kind of feels like."
3,b9qtbv,t2_x6cdp1k,SquirrelGirlVA,"NAH. Your brother was a moron. He's *just* now starting to realize how much of a fool he really was and how awful and toxic his wife actually is/was. That he apologized to you is actually a fairly good sign, as it shows that he realizes that he was an idiot. I don't think that many would blame you for not responding, however keep in mind that he's the only blood family you have and that once, before his terrible wife, you two were close. I don't think that you can ever really get back to where you were before, but I'd like to believe that you two could get to the point where you're in contact with one another. I'd give him a small chance here - I wouldn't help him financially, but I would throw him a small lifeline and just talk to him. I'm just afraid of you both regretting all of this later and then letting years keep you from reconnecting even after the worst of the pain is mostly gone. "
3,b9qtbv,t2_hcokh,limpingpigeon,"NTA. Your brother is the one that burned the bridge, and it's completely reasonable of you feel like you can't be his support now as a result. That said, it doesn't sound like you've entirely made up your mind and that's okay, too. Take time to decide what, if anything, you want from a relationship with your brother and move forward according to that. While it may very well be that much of his behavior stemmed from his manipulative (and if she was deliberately sabotaging his connections with others, most likely abusive) partner and he is now seeing that, it doesn't obligate you to invest in reforging that connection. "

3,axel0q,t2_1vv2rst8,Bajaboolie,"NTA, but you could have put yourself in a dangerous situation.

And now that I think of it, there was another situation of someone getting shot and killed for confronting a handicapped space violator. We all want to do it, but not worth the risk in my mind.

Were they wandering around your house looking for a bathroom when they discovered a room where you kept your Confederacy memorabilia? I have to imagine if I was in that situation, I'd probably start figuring out ways to get out of there. I wouldn't go the violent route, though. At most, I would probably get in an argument about it and leave. In reality, I would probably just make an excuse and go hang out with somebody else I didn't now suspect of being a closet racist. Congrats on writing an AITA about a Confederate flag where you come out looking alright, though. Even if you are probably not including the full story or are leaving out some key details. I've gotta say, you embellish your story with lots of talk about how important this flag is to your family and how it doesn't have any ties to white supremacy, but it still reads to me like your grandpa and uncle were both a couple of Confederates. The 'family history' line never really makes sense to me. I've got Nazis in my family tree's history, but I would never be particularly interested in hanging up a Hitler Youth uniform in my office."
3,b3s2dk,t2_304sd7im,owlcityy,"NTA 1) It’s in the privacy of your own home and it was in your office behind closed doors and 2) For whatever reason if someone had an issue with your flag, instead of making a huge scene, they could’ve left. I don’t necessarily agree with the calling of the cops on her however, she will learn not to destroy private property when she should be minding her own business.

I have a WW2 engraved fallschirmjäger rifle that I absolutely love for the design and history around it, but I can understand why some people would take it the wrong way when seeing it. Healthy adults should be able to have civil conversations about our history without breaking shit. I think that's a cool reason to hold onto a Confederate flag."
3,b3s2dk,t2_oik9w,anglerfishtacos,"NTA, with a side of ESH. The guest was out of line. She threw a giant tantrum, a smashed an antique heirloom frame. There is a right way and a wrong way to make your feeling known about the confederate flag, and this was not the way to go. Demanding she be criminally charged is a bit much, but I get it since your wife was injured. As far as a civil case, I would see about trying to just quietly settle this with her lawyer. I say that there is a side of ESH because you really have your head in the sand if you don’t understand why a person would not view your flag with a positive or neutral light. You may think there is nothing wrong with it because your relatives carried it in WW2 and the Vietnam War, but a person in your home that stumbles upon it while looking for the restroom is not going to know that or see it that way. They see your big flag in a prominent place (it was immediately noticed when she opened the door) in an expensive antique frame. From a third person viewpoint, it looks like you are glorifying the confederacy. In the future, you may want to seriously consider locking your office when having company over or take the flag down and put it away when guests are over. Frankly, if I had walked into your office and saw that, I would have not freaked like she did or made a scene, but I certainly would have thought some not great things about you and would want to have very little to do with your wife and family after. "
3,b3s2dk,t2_38eujj21,ageralds1,"NTA- woah, there are lines and she crossed it many times over. I know the flag is gross, but you had it in a frame small enough for one woman to hold, so likely folded respectfully. It represents war hero’s in your family. IT WAS IN YOUR PRIVATE OFFICE.

3,b3s2dk,t2_2ljykv,kingtutwashere,"NTA if the story you tell is true. While I can see how someone whose ancestors were literally enslaved under that flag having an adverse reaction to seeing one, I can admit going through your house, damaging property, and injuring your wife is an asshole move. However, to me you come across as a little bit of an asshole in the post for trying to pretend that the flag itself has no ties to racism. It kind of feels like your implying its an asshole move to have negative feelings towards that particular flag in general. The confederacy were traitors to the United States who killed US soldiers on American soil and wanted to keep human beings as property. Using/creating the confederate flag as their chosen symbol to stand behind. Just because your uncle and grandfather were good guys to you doesn't suddenly remove the legacy or symbolism of the flag. If you hang a flag that was hung during the enslavement and torture of an entire race be prepared for people to think you're kind of an asshole when they see it on the wall.

That was completely inappropriate. And then to make it about her and smash a family heirloom? WHOA. Nutjob behavior. Listen to some extent I'm with her. Regardless of why you have it, the fact of the matter is that the confederate flag is inflammatory. And it's a flag with a very rough history, and it shouldn't be displayed in public anymore. But we are talking about something in YOUR private home, where you can do more or less whatever you want with home decorations. The woman was WAY out of line. "

She apologised for her friend’s behaviour and offered to pay but then *said you were overreacting* (you were not) *tried to guilt you over “ruining a young woman’s life”* (she’s and adult and responsible for her own actions, if anyone “ruined her life” it was her) and * told you you shouldn’t have had the flag in your home at all*. That was not an apology, that was a masterclass in gaslighting. Pursue the flag-thrower for all she’s worth, both criminally and civilly. And reconsider your friendship with the woman who “apologised” under he guise of guilt-tripping you for something that was 0% your fault. "
3,b3s2dk,t2_11igcq,apathyontheeast,"NTA, but if you're going to have it on display where it's possible people will see it (even ""accidentally"" in a home office), you have to understand that people are going to have a reaction to it...though her reaction was WAY out of line. And its sounds like she will justly be paying for it. So you're NTA, but that doesn't mean I think you're making a smart decision. I want to say, I do sympathize with you, OP. My family has an heirloom rifle from the early 1900's or so with a swastika on it that was a gift to my family, as my great-great-uncle was one of the first Yellowstone Park guardians/wardens/custodians/whatnot - and I definitely think people would freak if they saw it without knowing it predates Nazi Germany by several decades. >They do not have any ties to white supremacy nor did they hold any racist views I don't totally know that I agree with this bit, though...but that's aside to the actual situation. "
3,b3s2dk,t2_ukzta24,propschick05,"NTA- I haven't read any comments because I feel like you explained the situation clearly. It was in a private area of the house behind a closed door, not a main area. The guest made a scene over it and damaged private property. I'm not a proponent of the Confederate flag at all, but you seem to have legitimate reasons. Maybe just take it down any time you are having people over that you don't know well to be safe. As far as filing the civil suit, won't the arrest that day show in her records anyway? Has she shown any remorse or offered to cover the costs? Was she drunk? "
3,b3s2dk,t2_2a2we1ds,KevinMMahon,"NTA. I hate confederate flags and all they stand for, but you weren't using it in correlation with any symbology, it is merely an heirloom of your family that has been passed down as something taken into wars for this country. It was in your own private quarters, and not only did she damage it in a way that costs money to repair/replace, but she injured your wife and made a scene that ruined a perfectly good and innocent party just because she found something harmless in a place she shouldn't have been."
3,a86kbb,t2_16k1v8,NMPire,"NTA. However (and this is mostly speculation), she might be approaching this from the perspective that school is important. At the very least, it gives you a solid fall back should your dream not pan out. If that's where she was coming from, you should've forgiven her. Also, don't be so quick to judge them. They may be supporting you in ways that aren't immediately clear (such as paying for things that you'll need)"
3,a86kbb,t2_2befghee,NickTheTuba,"NTA. Your mom showed her true colors when she said she doesn’t support you. While it is generally good to forgive people and accept their apologies, I can definitely understand why you’re mad. Ultimately, it just comes down to your mom having a bad parenting moment. All parents have them (some more than others) and often times, they’re not conscious decisions, but just things that they do because of how they were raised or what their life has been like. This definitely looks like a bad parenting moment, but the fact that your parents are waiting for you to accept the apology means that it’s not just a moment, is an ongoing issue. If it were me, tbh I would stay mad. Don’t accept the apology. Try to talk to them and explore the deeper issues at hand."
3,a82jrn,t2_12c7jd,elinordash,"NTA, but you need to get the hell out of this situation. Confident people know what they want out of a relationship and they don't settle for less. And honestly, if you'd said you needed commitment when the issue first came up there is like a 20% chance he would have gone for it. Now you're the desperate girl who will put up with whatever he wants and it is even less likely he'll ever want to be your boyfriend. "

3,9y7kwo,t2_26wqxw2t,lifetimemoviewatcher,"You are looking at this all wrong. The only reasons you want to stay are friends, societies and things being cheaper? Really? You want to leave because, among other things, you were poorly welcomed? Your abroad. Your there this study. This can be a fantastic opportunity for academic enrichment and resume enrichment. You get to explore a new country and culture. And of course you should meet wonderful people. I think your parents are right in not wanting you to leave. You are just looking for excesses to do it as evidenced by your list. You are facing inconveniences. Than solve them. Get help if needed to do that. Abandoning this opportunity that you have been given would be terrible. Look at the bigger picture. You would be the asshole if you left particularly if your parents are supporting your education abroad with their hard earned money."
3,aejroo,t2_bybl2,atrueamateur,"YTA. No matter the tone you used, you are forbidding her from going on a trip *your parents* invited her on. A trip that will involve your mother going on a plane and through a crowded city and encountering thousands of people, many of whom probably carry airborne-spreadable illnesses, which is a risk she apparently takes no issue with. You don't even know if what your girlfriend has is contagious. You should have talked to your parents first before laying down the law with your sick girlfriend. EDIT: For the record, my mother has RA. She's travelled with me or my sister sick all the time and just uses sensible good hygiene practices to protect herself. It's not like your mom is waiting for someone to breathe on her wrong and she'll collapse dead."
3,aejroo,t2_4ulh6,jennerality,"YTA - of course you're not wrong in letting her know but obviously if the delivery was ""kinda harsh"" (and if you think it was ""kinda harsh"" I'm gonna guess it was just harsh) there is no need for that. Sounds like she said she understood but of course she's going to be disappointed since she was excited and also feeling like shit since she has such a high fever. Also, not exactly sure what the purpose of continuing to rant after she agreed... did you want or expect her reaction to be happy and chipper? Sometimes situations just suck and it's no one's fault; doesn't mean you can't be sad about it. She's the one who is feeling ill and also now likely can't go on a trip she was looking forward to so some empathy and comfort would be expected here."
3,aejroo,t2_2sju1483,WandofMagicMissile,"Nta but maybe ESH? It sounds like your mom is using medication to treat her condition and THAT is causing the immune compromization. Idk how the condition itself is causing that I have similar medication but it really only makes you higher risk for severe illnesses, not the common cold. It just makes it easier for TB to take hold. I even work in medicine, interacting safely with Flu and C diff patients. You kinda over reacted but your mom may be a germaphobe after hearing the small side effects. At first I wouldnt want to do specific parts of my job but I was just paranoid and overthinking it. > It's new york city at a play...your mom is going to be exposed to much worse. Cant you literally keep them separated? I would try to make this work but I hate being away from my wife. It doesnt sound like you all are in the same hotel room Idk your mother she could get ill easily, I have similar medication but I am an athlete in my mid 20s."
3,aejroo,t2_2md0v7ll,ThatNewSockFeel,"YTA, but from the right place. It's commendable to try and keep your mother from getting sick but on the other hand she's about to get on a plane and travel to NYC. Both places filled with germs and opportunities to get sick. As long as your girlfriend isn't coughing and sneezing all over your mom and promises to be as careful as possible I don't know if it's fair to say she can't come just for that reason. If your mom is taking precautions against getting sick in those places I don't think your girlfriend (who will presumably be on the mend) is going to pose much additional risk."
3,aejroo,t2_x6cdp1k,SquirrelGirlVA,"NTA. NTA. NTA. It's not like you were making a flippant decision. You could've been nicer, but if she wasn't getting the point that this could make your mom incredibly sick then some harsh wording would be in order. It's not like you were doing it because you're a germaphobe or anything, but because this could really fuck up your mom's health. My grandparents had several points in their later lives where they were immuno-compromised because of various health issues. There were times that we flat out told relatives (especially those with children) not to come over because they had a cold they could catch. When I lived with them I would honestly sequester myself if I ever got sick, because I didn't want to pass it on to them. I don't think a lot of people realize how bad something can get with people whose immune system is compromised. It's not like someone passing on a cold to a person with a normal immune system, as a simple cold can turn into a hospital stay and even a life threatening issue. "
3,a1rpn7,t2_pcitxcd,Wikidess,"NTA but be warned >I want the extra responsibility but not without the title and pay that goes with it. I know many people who've missed out on a promotion for having that sort of attitude. At my current job, I was asked to train to be the backup for another (higher) position. This came with a lot more responsibility but no pay raise. I was her backup for a year, and then she was promoted, leaving her position empty. Which I filled, receiving a hefty raise. Now there were a few people who had been there longer and felt like that promotion should have been theirs - but they didn't want the extra responsibility without the pay. Since I had spent a year as her backup, I was the logical choice to replace her. For me, the money I'm making now is well worth the year of extra work and no raise =) "
3,a1rpn7,t2_y6gk1,TheSpanishKarmada,"NTA I don't understand why they can't pay you a managers salary for the time that you're performing managers duties?

3,adrfp7,t2_wqks4tb,finianden,"YTA, but that’s because you’re probably a teenager. I spent a lot of time traveling internationally with my family, having similar fights with my brother and then subsequently with my parents, and now when I remember them I cringe. Now that I’m an adult I appreciate SO much that they worked so hard so my brother and I could have these incredible experiences few others got to have. But it took me growing up and working and understanding things more to get to this point. Cut your dad some slack, I read that he’s also working while you’re there, so he’s probably pretty stressed with it all. Take a second and let him you appreciate him working hard for you guys, it’ll go a long way for him. "
3,apxa03,t2_10uwve,MrFluffPants1349,"YTA-ish? I mean, she asked and you gave her an honest response. Sure, you could have been more tactful, but considering you were 15 it's understandable that you weren't. She probably has that condition where you sweat constantly and it smells bad. I went to school with a kid like that, and unfortunately most kids don't realize it's not as easy as just wearing deoderant and showering regularly. Maybe your telling her that helped her realize the issue, as we tend to get used to our own smells. "

Sorry if this is embarrassing but it's something that you can definitely take care of now that you know about it."""
3,apxa03,t2_dii8k,ElectricFleshlight,"NTA. You were young, so it was a learning experience. When you need to say something potentially embarrassing, it's best to do so in private. You told her she stinks in front of a group, which was humiliating for her. Yes, they all knew she stinks too, but it doesn't make it less embarrassing. When Robin asked if you know why, you should have taken her aside and quietly told her where the others couldn't hear. Honestly, you'd known she has body odor problems for a while, so it would have been best to say something privately long beforehand. That's part of friendship, being respectfully honest with each other. "
3,apxa03,t2_2bv761lj,bryanaguilar2773,NTA It was brave of you not to beat around the bush. Everyone keeps saying you could have been more delicate. How do you tell someone they smell like cat urine delicately. You can't. You did the right thing. And honestly probably improved her life over all. Because she is now aware of it. It may have hurt at first. But hard truths usually do. I would want someone to tell me if the roles were reversed

I would, however, get it in writing with a third party witness that your mom is relinquishing ownership of the dog to you before you rehome it.

But asking politely does not entitle you to getting your way. He said no and you badgered him again! I'd have put on headphones too. \- You're aghast at his behavior, but he was not the one requesting special treatment. Give him the benefit of the doubt too -- maybe he gets anxious flying and chose the exit seat due to fear. \- I get that plane rides are uncomfortable when you're taller. That said a LOT of people are 6 ft tall. Meaning there were likely other people on the plane who didn't make a scene. You tell the story as if you're a 7 ft giantess. &#x200B; &#x200B;"
3,axfrqy,t2_zm4j6,kashikoicat,"YTA I mean... I guess you're free to try asking, but persisting after he refuses is assholic. He wasn't ""mean and vindictive"" and he didn't treat you like shit, and certainly not because you're tall and he's short. He was annoyed (and rightly so) because he chose his seat, turned down your request to switch, and you persisted. You paid for the seat you had. He paid for the seat he had.

3,an6sao,t2_udmac,Hunterofshadows,"NTA Considering she is bi she should be a hell of a lot more understanding than she is being. It’s hard to believe someone who is bi can be that dense. You aren’t bi just because you’ve been with a guy in the past. Lots of lesbians have been with guys once or twice because figuring out your identity is hard. Edit: that being said, have you specially told her before that you identify as lesbian and not bi? Or is this the first that this has actually come out? If it’s the latter, I’d say NAH "
3,an6sao,t2_a7rap,MadtownMaven,"YTA - When you talk about being with men as being a shameful thing, your gf hears that she done something shameful. That may not be your intention, but that is what you are arguing comes across as. It does sound biphobic. Rather than focus on that you should have a follow up discussion with her when you've both calmed down about how while you were with guys in the past, it was done out of confusion and not something you're happy reliving. That you now identify as a lesbian and you need her to respect that now. You're fine if she's happy talking about her past relationships, but that talking about your past male partners really puts you in a negative space and that you'd hope she'd want to help you avoid that by not mentioning it again or with others.

You and your wife really should come to an agreement on this, rather than you just dictating how it goes and her trying to make up for what she apparently sees as your share of the work as a couple. You get to have boundaries (and should) but you could have handled this better. Your SIL is an ass for repeatedly pulling this stunt, but all of you have enabled her in this and apparently no one has made any significant effort to rein her in. And it seems the rest of the family has no problem with being her unpaid servants while she plays queen for a day. For her next birthday, maybe your wife or some other family member can help SIL plan the party ahead of time so that the work can be split over time and help can be hired if needed. Otherwise, you and your wife just do whatever you've agreed to do as a couple ahead of time (after cooling down from this one).

Even their daughter is not entitled to help with expense without conditions. You're entitled to your opinion and live your life how you want but not to force others to facilitate it.

Now I’m not straight so maybe the rules are different but all you have to do is cancel the date (proactively is better) and then ghost her. Don’t stand her up.

You had previously communicated your needs to her multiple times, and rather than addressing them and discussing ways to compromise, she ignored you and continued doing what she felt like doing. Guess she thought she could get away with it forever. Sounds like she's had her ears opened now? I dunno the solution, though, beyond compromises that might seem petty or awkward now but might be your only hope as you two are on complete opposite ends of the video watching spectrum. The (unrealistic?) cure is to get your faces out of those screens, get off your kiesters, and become active as a couple, of course. Otherwise, you could alternate days or shows. Movies that are strongly your preference are to be watched your way, and vice versa, with the option for the less interested partner to choose to do a completely different activity with no pouting from either party. That sort of thing. Less invested daily viewings could be watched with less than 100% consideration; she agrees to scale back her interruptions but not stop totally, and you agree to respond to a few chats per hour and let her know when you're going to tune her out to enjoy the rest of the show?

3,aet5d9,t2_2vxiunef,ConfusedUniform,"He shouldn't leave her there alone if others are uncomfortable but YTA for being so concerned about his personal life. Just because they shower together doesn't mean they're having sex. They could be but maybe they just enjoy taking a shower to start their morning together. Someone else has also probably jacked off in there multiple times, and the previous tenants also probably did things there to. Are they leaving behind a mess? No? Then as long as there is no issues with schedules no one should care. As for him buying his own things maybe he has a preference or his girl does. If he's not using the communal stuff he shouldn't be forced to buy it. He may also be planning on moving out at some point so buying his own appliances isn't weird. Leaving his girlfriend home at the house every day while he is gone is kinda tricky. She isn't on the lease and most places have a rule on how long guest can stay. Have a chat about it, if you guys don't feel comfortable maybe talk to him about it. Also asking for a lock to be on your door is not paranoia. He just wants a way to make sure his room is safe. Why does it concern you if he looks his room or not?"
3,aet5d9,t2_grct7,MontRouge,"YTA. Meh, it's nothing too weird imo. If the girlfriend is just staying in his room and isn't stealing or breaking things it shouldn't be an issue. It's his house too. Showering together could just mean showering and not fucking btw. Why would they do it there when they have a bed in their own room? As long as they don't leave some nasty stuff in the bathroom, I don't see the issue. Also, he is allow to have his own things and want a lock on his door.

Why is a couple having sex in a shower any more gross than three dudes sharing one for years? Sounds like a group of young guys who are growing up and developing their own lives, just because you live together doesn't mean you have to be friends or even friendly, just means you gotta pay the Bill's and get along(not be hostile).

You can't be worrying about things like money during that time period. It sounds like Mike and his wife understand this, and on top of that you have discussed actually paying rent with him. Just keep doing what you need to do to get your mental health in order. That is priority #1. Because they care enough about you that they'd rather you not pay rent and be alive. But it's hard to not worry about it because I'm sure that you have anxiety, as the two go hand-in hand. So keep the financial discussion open with Mike. Once per month, ask him how he is feeling and if he wants you to start financially contributing. And tell him that you're going to keep asking him once a month - and actually do it. At that point, the ball is always in his court and you won't have to worry about whether or not you're being an asshole."

If he had enforced this with all his clients, that would make more sense. It seems like he is taking his annoyance of you canceling out on you in an unprofessional manner.

Your story makes me sad because it sounds like you believe that behaving obediently should make your parents love you. Your parents probably feel alienated because your understanding of relationships is that you have to fulfill the desires and expectations of others in order to have them value and like you. They probably want to connect to you emotionally, and the fact that you look down on your ""less successful"" siblings and resent the fact that your parents can connect with them makes your whole family even further alienated. I know that this is what you struggle with, and I really hope you can find some resolution and peace for yourself. That path may begin by learning to value your relationships and the people involved in those relationshios, and not the things you ""have"" like your salary or wife.

The main issue is that you do not live on a deserted island and there are plenty of girls you could date who are not your ex's best friend. Your ex has one best friend. You have literally billions of other options. The only reason you'd date her best friend is if you think she is the ""one."" Like, get-married-and-make-babies-the-""one."" Otherwise, she's just a lay that you could get elsewhere. Even if you thought she was the one, the correct time to date her best friend is after your ex has met someone and they are official. Even then, feelings may be hurt, but at least she will be in a relationship so anything she says about being hurt or jealous will be a direct insult against her current significant other. As a result, she'd probably just shut the fuck up and you'd be free to date her bestie. Personally, I'd wait like six months after she's met someone or when their facebook status changes."

Food dishes and litter box were filled to near overflowing - she put in as much litter and food as possible so that she wouldn't have to come every day. Only thing not overflowing was the mail because renovator brought it in when he saw it wasn't being done.

If I paid a professional cat/house sitter and they left my cat in a stressful situation where his litter box was so dirty he couldn’t use it, there’s no way they’d be getting paid. They’d also be getting reported for neglect. She shouldn’t have had to drive to and from her place if she was house sitting for you. You do not need to reimburse her for that. You could give a part-payment for her feeding him. Like one third of the total amount or something similar. Next time you have a house sitter, you may want to set up a smart security camera near the front door so that you can track how often the person is inside your home, or something similar. "

3,aije30,t2_4rqvh,CreeDorofl,"NTA - ugh, I kinda feel this one because I've been the asshole 23-year old who neglected catboxes. It's so nasty scooping or changing them, but you have to ignore the chore for a while before the cats say ""fuck this"" and start pissing elsewhere. I don't think they do that, if a clean-enough box is available. Still, you're in an awkward spot where it's sort of he-said she-said. To you, the evidence of is clearcut and obvious that she didn't stay over, and didn't scoop/change as often as she should have. And I believe you. But would a judge, if they dragged you into small-claims court? I think that even though they didn't do a good job and even though it's gonna end up costing you money, you might want to throw them a few bucks just so that you put this drama behind you, and avoid the possibility of going to court over it. Just some dollar amount that will prevent this girl's mom from saying ""She made my kid work for a whole week and didn't pay her a dime!"" ...paying nothing at all might seem logical based on the damage you incurred, but I don't think it would hold up legally.

However, the way you are handling it is, to put it frankly, less than stellar. Her moral liability here is precisely whatever her legal liability is, and your appropriate recourse would be to determine what that legal liability is, and what actions you would need to take to hold her accountable for it. It may very well be that she's liable for the cost of damages associated with the urine, but it strikes me as something for a neutral third party (not her mom, lol) to determine rather than the aggrieved, unilaterally.

You owe her the $1000. 10 spots of urine over 7.5 weeks indicates she absolutely did clean the litterbox and do her duties. If she didn't clean the litter box there would have been hundreds of spots, your whole house would have been covered in shit and piss. You're literally being a cheap pos and stealing work from another person because you are mad you have to clean up after your cats because they acted out a little while you were gone."
3,aije30,t2_npcu11l,mathxjunkii,"NAH- I don’t think. I’m wondering if maybe the cat peed because you guys were gone for 7.5 weeks and the cat was angry about that? So maybe the girl cleaned the box adequately but the cat was upset? Cats are temperamental. That being said- when the issue started, she needed to call you or have her mom call you immediately and have you guys make a decision about what to do next (such as boarding the cat) because that’s unacceptable. You noted that the girls mom listed one of her daughters expenses as “gas driving to and from your house”. Ask the mother why that cost is so high if her daughter were suppose to be staying at your house. And ask why no one communicated with you when they noticed that the cat was not using the litter box, despite it being clean (when and if it was). Because cat pee is quite a problem. That’s not like a dog peeing on the rug by the door because he wasn’t let out in time. Cats pee to be vindictive and the smell is potent. I’m wondering if she peed to mark territory because she didn’t like the girl that was house sitting (cats are also choosy about their care takers). "
3,aije30,t2_1e6tmurj,TheCheekyTrollop,"NTA and if I were you, I’d be tempted to tell the mother, since you are her business client, that unless her daughter (or she on the daughter’s behalf) reimburses you for the property damage you’ve suffered (which is worth even more than the 1K you didn’t pay) then you will be taking your custom elsewhere. In all seriousness though, your business relationship with this woman is probably ruined. But her daughter didn’t do the job, so shouldn’t get paid, it’s very simple. She’s lucky you’re not pursuing her for costs for your flooring and potential loss of deposits."
3,aije30,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"NTA If you pay her a dime, you'd be the asshole. She caused you at least a thousand in damage. No pay. She didn't live there, she left that poor cat alone for almost 2 months, and she didn't clean the litter boxes. Paying her would be insane, because she caused damage and left the cat in an unsanitary environment. I can't imagine how horrible it was for him. Alone with urine smell everywhere, and no clean box. Have him checked at the vet as well. Stress and forced habits like this can cause urinary issues in the future. Who knows if he even got fresh water and twice daily food. Don't give her a pass because mommy is upset that her daughter is a lazy liar. Some people think they can get what they want by throwing a big enough fit."
3,aije30,t2_nliktfb,Nevertofart,"NTA. Don’t pay her. Your poor cat. My fiancé and I have a dog and two cats, when their litter is full they hold it until they absolutely can’t. (Happened once). When we go out of town, I hire my cousin to stay over. Pay her way too much for usually a max of 3 days til I found out she never even stayed at our place. Our pets love human interaction, that’s what i paid for. Couldn’t prove it, so I installed a camera for next time. Now pet sitters can’t lie. Has worked so far except for that time one person who didn’t know we have a camera and claimed to had fed the cats. "
3,aije30,t2_hh9wk,notastepfordwife,"NTA, but if they sue, they might get something, because while she MASSIVELY screwed up, your cat isn't dead. He got fed, she took in the mail, but she was lax on the pooping scooping. What ***I*** would do is pay her half, and explain to her that she's only getting money for the stuff she's proven to do, because the other half you're going to have to use on the damages to your apartment. Alternatively, you might post on /r/askvets, he might have peed in places due to stress. "
3,aije30,t2_2kvbpz7t,Sybellie,"Nta. Some comments being the cats not dead, that doesn't make it ok. OP hired the sitter to live in her house for 7.5 weeks, you know to give the cats company for a few hours a day at least. Not make pop ins for 10 minutes every couple days. I wouldnt be paying someone over $1000 to spend 10 minutes feeding a cat and only occasionally cleaning the litter box. That's a 100$ job max, which I could just get a family member to do (and do the same for them as a trade). OP I'd ask how much time she actually spent with your cats, out of curiosity on my part."
3,aije30,t2_9rv5k,lyssargh,"NTA and her mother is completely ridiculous. Caring for your cat is part of owning one, obviously! You know that! She should know that! That's what her daughter was hired to do and she completely failed. Your cat lived in its own filth for weeks while you were gone. How is that less disgusting than cleaning out the litter pan? How was that preferable to her? Did she even stop by daily? Maybe she came in occasionally to give lots of food and water. Who knows? Paying her for neglect would make you more of an asshole than refusing to pay her for it."
3,aije30,t2_1yqznxbs,PlagueDrsWOutBorders,"NTA, and I'm sorry you all are going through this. From a legal standpoint, you hired her to provide a service, which she failed to provide. If you wanna challenge it, you will need proof that she did not provide the services requested. Unfortunately, I don't think you have that unless she admits to the lack of cleaning out the litter box. She will need to be paid still, I just don't know if it's the full amount. She did keep the pets fed and get the mail and effectively was working for you in that regard. I would personally decide if it's worth it to fight. Maybe cut the payment down by 30 percent because she failed 1/3 of her job? Be prepared that if you don't pay her then they could take it to small claims court and would have a decent case. Cleaning up the cat pee wasn't listed in the agreement it seems, and again you would need proof the litter box was not cleaned."
3,aije30,t2_7ua8i,Melmoe,"YTA, and that will be unpopular, but I am saying this because you hired someone who, from what I can tell, was not an experienced animal caretaker. I get that in your mind this should not be hard and honestly it is not hard, but you left the care of your rented home and your beloved pet to a 23 year old business associate's care. Right there is why I say YTA. First, no on every single end of leaving a beloved pet with a stranger and an inexperienced person for 7.5 WEEKS. Also, there is no proof that your cat did not have some serious issues with feeling neglected with said stranger as his/her family left him for 7.5 weeks. I would never leave an animal for that long nor would I leave it with someone they didn't know or was not completely vetted and trained/experienced in taking care of my beloved friend. In short, you shouldn't of left your cat in this manner. There are many resources now for taking care of an animal and many sites vet caretakers and then there appropriate care given 24 hours a day. Second, you picked a business associate's daughter (EEK!). That is rough to get yourself out from behind as being viewed as the ""bad guy"". You made a mistake hiring this girl. She probably did a shit job but there is honestly no way to prove it. Your best attempt at remedying such a situation is giving her the agreed price (to avoid a potential small courts claim) and not being a reference for her in the future, obviously. If you're in the US, the USPS puts a vacation hold on mail. Also, there are many high experienced and loving people whom are willing to bring in a family pet to take care of and loved into their home while you are on vacation which would cost around the same (but less considering the repairs now needed on your home). "
3,aije30,t2_pokms,Synjaqt,"NTA I think you should pay her some (maybe 100-250 out of the $1000), but definitely not the full amount and this is coming from someone who does pet sit and also has two cats. I remember I felt guilty for forgetting to put in this one family’s dog’s eye drops in once (I was supposed to do it twice a day in both eyes for the week I was watching them and I forgot to do one eye because their dog was giving me a hard time so I decided I’d do it when he calmed down and forgot). I can’t imagine doing something like forgetting to clean the litter box, it’s such a simple and necessary task"
3,aije30,t2_146ovr,goodgreat123,"YTA As a fellow pet sitter, things often don’t go as planned. Sometimes there are accidents that happen when a pet is acting out that you are gone. She cleaned the litter box every three days, I have two cats and usually clean the litter boxes every three days and they never look unusable— the cats usually cover up their mess and continue to use it. There is no visible mess after three days, which probably explains why she didn’t clean it every day as you asked. If she’s not familiar with cats she might not have realized the pee and poop was buried. Your cat might have been peeing outside the litter box as revenge for you leaving. She also kept your cat fed and brought the mail in like you asked. She wasn’t completely negligent, but might have misunderstood your instructions about the litter box. It’s wrong to refuse to pay her at all. She didn’t do 1/3 of the job you asked her to do exactly like you asked her to do it, but she DID keep your cat alive. I recommend paying her 2/3 of the agreed upon fee and never using her to cat sit ever again. "
3,aije30,t2_30kq3lbz,rueforyou,"NTA. She entirely failed to do one of the most important parts of her job. She neglected the cat and the cat must have been utterly miserable. She has caused you hours of work and a great deal of expense. In no way is this horribly neglectful girl due $1000.

If the mother thinks this was ""the cat's fault,"" she is modeling terrible irresponsibility to her daughter. "
3,aije30,t2_wj8xv,PowerpuffPills,"YTA. You were willing to pay $1000, that's not an amount that will get you a well trained cat sitter. Now, you're living with the consequences of that decision. It is your cat, you took the risk of losing deposits by getting a cat in the first place. If you're reasonable, you can propose deducting some of the money for not following instructions fully, but she still worked for you for 7,5 weeks, fed your cat, took in your mail, so she has done 2 of the 3 tasks you set out for her and that would warrant at least 2/3 of the money. Either way, it's your cat and it was your decision to hire a non-professional to save money. Not paying someone who has worked for you - even if the job is only 66% well done - is a full on asshole move and I hope to God if you don't pay, they'll take you to court. Also, stop hiring random people to look after your cat, from your comments I can see your cat pees around when you're not home and your expectations of your non-professional cat sitters are way too high."

I want you to know you’re not an asshole but try to keep up with other family as best you can. Otherwise you’ll be branded the family asshole because your sister WILL manipulate everyone onto her side because she’s there and you’re not. I’m not saying force yourself to interact with her but even a phone call to keep up with everyone else is good. Ultimately avoid the topic of rekindling with your sister with everyone. It’s a minefield you’re walking into but it’s better than being around someone who tells you such horrible things. My dad didn’t care what his family thought at a certain point and decided to let himself be the family asshole. It works for him because he’s several states away, is loved by his favorite sister and nephew, and barely visits the area. But it still sucks and hurts him when his mother is needlessly hurtful with her words because he can’t “make up” with his abusive sister."
3,b43kef,t2_ew6u4,Fecapult,NTA. I had to cut off my sister after coming to the conclusion that dealing her was toxic on every level - life's been blissful. I will say that you shouldn't let her keep you from seeing the rest of the family that you like though.

This is one of those things where you either have to just let the person go, or just wait it out until the person grows the fuck up and realised what an ass they’ve been.

It might make you feel better to yell at her, but you just as easily could have explained in a normal tone of voice that she had you worried sick, and you're punishing her for both ignoring her curfew and not letting you know she was going to be late. You were right to ground her. Her actions have consequences."

3,acx62a,t2_1stis7l,crazybunny19,"NAH. Being a parent is hard. Being a single parent is even harder. I have teen kids and totally understand the worry when we don't hear from them. You probably over-reacted. And it's okay to tell her that. Explain why it scared you, how much you love her and want to know she's safe. Make sure she has a car charger for her phone, and next time, use a friend's phone to let you know. Ask how she would handle it if she were the parent or her younger siblings did something like this. It at least gets her thinking about how worried she might be in the same situation. My ex left me. I'm chronically ill and mostly bed bound. Like you, it has changed the relationship I have with my teens, because they do have more responsibilities than most teens. I try to take the approach that we are team and need to work together. That means clear communication. Personally, I would apologize for yelling, explain that I was anxious because I was worried, and unground her on the understanding that next time, no excuses, she needs to contact you and let you know the plan. And if possible, try to find a way to alleviate her ""parenting"" burden. Can you afford a part time sitter for the younger kids? An after school program? Do you pay her for her time? You really don't want her to feel like a parent and burn out before she even is old enough to be a mom herself. Sending you love and support because this parenting shit is hard."
3,acx62a,t2_2tubscar,MostlyPretentious,"NAH, though verging on YTA. The yelling was unnecessary, but it’s good for her to understand actions have consequences, though given this is the first time maybe giving her a little leniency would be better. Given how she approached you, I’d say talk to her, let her know how worried you were and why you have the rules, but tell her she made a good point and maybe lighten her punishment."
3,acx62a,t2_839e9e7,Labalool,"ESH Your daughter sucks for staying out late and not contacting you (she could have used someone else's phone) You suck for yelling and grounding out of initial emotional response.

Even take your daughter our you and her time to time as a treat for all her hard work. Tbh I was very mature at 16 and wouldn't have appreciated grounding as a punishment. I would've much prefer to discuss concerns/apologise and understand that grounding is on the cards if it were to happen again but not for a first time offence.

Also probably mentioning things you already know and have done but worth having a safety and relationship talk with your daughter when this is cooled down. Have a 'safe text' where she can pretend to ask to stay out longer but you know that's code for 'I really want you to say no' Discuss personal safety especially in case alcohol may be involved in future."

Apologize for yelling and thank her for doing so much to contribute but remind her that you are a parent and worry about her wellbeing and part of being a grownup is checking in with people who care for you. And buy her a portable phone charger so this doesnt happen again. Do not cancel the grounding. Im not even a parent yet im saying this as someones grown child. 
3,acx62a,t2_2cyekuz2,giraffemoo,"NTA. Kids who lose parents are still kids. Still need to follow rules. A man who lost his wife is gonna be worried if he doesnt hear from his daughter...I lost my husband last year and I have this flaw...I freak out if I cant get ahold of someone right away. You yelled because you were scared. Tell her that. Tell her that you were mad because you got so scared over not knowing if she was okay. In my grief support group they told us that it's actually a good thing when our kids see us break down over the death...it teaches them that it's okay for them to feel those feelings to, and it shows them that there is always a way out of those feelings."
3,acx62a,t2_ms4hd6u,Reverend_Vader,"YTA Now let me explain why due to quite unique circumstances. As i type this my daughter is out on the town on her own for the first time ever. (18 Today, UK drinking age) She has been through loads of shit not including losing her mother, she lost her brother. I did not have to put child rearing responsibilities her way but I have learned how much thrusting a kid into adulthood too early fuck up their head. When she lost her brother she also lost her mother who is now on low level autopilot, she has checked out of as much as she can do and more, when i speak to her she often complains about ""adulting"" her mother or the issues caused by her mom no longer taking that role. She needs to enjoy and experience childhood bro, give her a little more slack than you would give a normal 16 yr old. The more chill you are, the better she will respond and keep open communication with you, trust me here! The trade off for the parneting is a little more slackening of the reigns than normal, It's her release valve from having to play parent to kids at 16 and the push back can be huge if you get it wrong. Her mother has been all up in her business for today and she knew she'd be txting every 5 mins, what did she do, leave her phone at home. I've treated my daughter like an adult for a couple of years, i also never forgot she is a kid at heart and needs to feel independent. The scenario you are in now means screaming is the most counter productive thing you can do. Give her space and let her be with the agreement she keeps in touch. An hour is an hour, it's no biggy an easily passed when your'e enjoying yourself. I told my daughter i would treat her like an adult, however i also told her until she was 18 it was my house and my rules and all i needed was a 5 second txt saying ""chill dad, home soon/later"" "
3,acx62a,t2_nd7ra,here_kitkittkitty,"YTA!! holy crap bud, you could have gone about that so much better, it's no wonder she's upset. this sounds like it's the first time she's ever fucked up what she had to do(and her excuses seem valid. this shit happens on occasion)and your immediate reaction was to yell and ground?? i get you were worried but chill out a bit. you could have, calmly, explained that you were worried about her, that she needs to be more cognizant of her phone battery and time, then let it go. my mom use to overreact like this over a simple mistake and it made me hate her more than i already did(i'm not saying she hates you) and resent her. i think it's time you have a real sit down with her and see how she really feels about you putting extra responsibility on her. she's not a replacement for your wife(as it were)and you might be mommifying her too much. it's fine that you want her to help you out but you're the parent, not her. you have to make sure you're not putting to much on her. you don't want resentment for you and her siblings to kick in. "
3,acx62a,t2_q04mu,zeffke008,"NTA - at that time, you were worried and you wanted her to know. Yelling might not be the best option but she understood. If I may give my take on this, Id say sorry for the yelling, and ground her for like a week or maybe 2 and then make that curfew a bit longer (maybe 12~) like she can't even go to the late night movies if 8-9pm so to say. She is still a kid even if she has more responsabilities, but give her a but more room to do so."
3,acx62a,t2_w97pyo1,AmbulanceDriver3,NTA. Rules are rules and she’s old enough to understand them.

If you didn’t check it and hence missed any implications that this might be a sexual massage then YTA. You guys watch porn together, he thought you signed him up for it hence you’d have no problem with it (just like you have no problem with some other kinky stuff indirectly involving others such as porn). If it wasn’t advertised or implied to be a sexual thing and the place isn’t known for erotic massages then NTA (the masseuse is the asshole). I would give the place a call even cause their shit is shady and they could get fucked. I understand your disgust, but this was a misunderstanding.

I'm also going to say that I grew up dealing with anxiety, depression, an eating disorder, and a few other things. Not having access to my devices made this worse because that was how I talked to my friends. "
3,arooyg,t2_1to0qqa2,MikkiTh,"YTA I'm not saying no limits, but as a parent with kids around the same age? Half of their school work is online, and so is their social life. As long as their grades are good and chores are done there's not a real reason to restrict their access to so much. (My kids are 19 & 12, the oldest is in college and making access to tech conditional on good grades really worked out. He's in college on a full ride academic scholarship. The youngest is in 7th grade and so far except for the occasional ""Go to bed already, he's got mostly A's and is about as good about chores as can be expected. They get done, we just have occasional ""Do it better."" interactions.) "
3,arooyg,t2_1hr373o5,hellboyjv3,YTA: You’re being too strict on them. It’s almost as if you’re punishing them. If they are doing fine in school and are staying out of trouble then allow them freedom. If they do bad in school or cause trouble then take away phones or games. My parents let us use our phones and game systems as long as we finished homework and kept good grades. So let your kids have more freedom or they might resent you a bit for being so strict. They might throw you in a retirement home later in life.
3,arooyg,t2_11akmc,visvya,"YTA. How do your kids write research papers, look up khan academy videos, and develop computational literacy without access to their electronics? How do they text their friends for homework help or to organize extracurricular activities that will get them into college? Taking away their playstation during the week is fine, and setting a time limit for their laptops and phones is reasonable (say, 11pm). But this blanket ban is harming their ability to succeed academically and socially after they graduate high school. You could compromise by telling them to get a job and pay for their phone, but that would take much more time and energy away from their schoolwork. "
3,arooyg,t2_6rj74,enna12,"YTA They're not little kids anymore. IMO, they're old enough to have electronics. If you think they'll start slipping in school, wouldn't you want them to be able to use their phones outside of school so they don't use them in school? I'm sure you can find some common ground where you let them have them after all of their homework is done or setting time limits (there's plenty of ways to automatically set up parental controls like that)."
3,arooyg,t2_kwh0mxr,GoodQueenFluffenChop,Yeah you're kinda YTA. Their grades are good and they're not toddlers who need controlled screen time. It's one thing to have a no phones at the dinner table and at bedtime. What you're doing is a perfect punishment for when they let their screen time take precedence over chores and grades. Think of it this way it'll be good way to learn time management for when they're adults in that they'll learn there's a time and place for when they can goof around with their electronics. Them not having access to learn now just means that when they're 18 they'll go a bit crazy with them since it was the forbidden fruit.
3,arooyg,t2_2bn9nezk,hazelchicken,"**YTA** I understand your concerns but your 16 yr old son especially should be able to keep contact with his friends outside of school hours. He can drive, he can have sex, he can get married - but he can't text his mates? What are grades over the ability to keep contact with your friends? It'd probably feel pretty bad being the one friend everyone has spent the least time with. They can talk and play with each other whenever they like, they aren't isolated from the world every night. "
3,arooyg,t2_120l75bb,blitzedginger,"YTA. a) it seems that you're worried without cause since all the kids are doing well, and b) you could easily institute another rules system that would get you what you want such as ""no electronics until you've finished homework"" and ""you'll be grounded from your electronics if you miss assignments or get a failing grade"". But you should also really take into consideration what people are saying about kids these days actually needing their devices for schoolwork itself. Google, Youtube, Word, etc. helped me with homework every single night. That's a huge resource to take away and really ironic that it's being taken away ""to keep the focus on school"". I wouldn't discount the social impact either. I totally empathize with parents who worry about the tech downside: short attention spans, scrolling/check-in addiction, cyber-bullying, porn, you name it - but if kids don't have any access to phones & computers, honestly, the next problem you're looking at is how much you're isolating them from their peers and building resentment. It's kind of like they're grounded every single night and have to go no-contact with people Monday through Friday. That's going to have a harsh impact on their respective groups and friendships. Also...I don't think ""you must live only for school and that's all you need to worry about"" is really a good message. You're creating feelings of isolation and pressure where there just doesn't need to be. I really recommend loosening up a bit. Just because your teens will have more access to their friends & more things to do in their free time does not mean they're suddenly going to become different kids and start tanking in school. Bring some trust and balance to the table. I think your relationships will all be better for it. "
3,arooyg,t2_2e1l21r1,moll_moll_moll,"YTA. I understand the desire to build healthy habits and have solid rules but your kids are in their teens. It's 2019. You're pushing them away from you with this absurd extreme. Limiting their time would be a good approach in my opinion, but when I was in school electronics were necessary for communicating about group projects, using the internet for homework, and yes, some recreational browsing or gaming. Growing up in an uber strict house where we had rules like this drove a massive rift between my parents and I. On top of that- if their grades are good and they're being well behaved, show them some appreciation of that. Be proud! It sounds like you have good kids. You're doing a good job but definitely take stock of whether your approach is appropriate for this modern day and age. "
3,arooyg,t2_13f0ua,SamaramonM,"YTA. They're teenagers. All their friends are online. They're probably missing out on plans, birthdays, parties, making friends. It's the reality for teenagers these days, as hard as it is to grasp. Not to mention online research and literature needed for school. You're punishing them in a very stone-age way. And not to sound too harsh, I'm sure you mean well, but I would hate to be your kid. You can still prevent this. "
3,arooyg,t2_jqj5e,ceebee6,"YTA. It’s like the type of parent who holds close reigns and then doesn’t understand why their kid is floundering or struggles being an adult when they go off to college. Part of being a parent in teaching them and guiding them into adulthood. Better for them to make smaller, less impactful mistakes now and learn from them than to wait until they’re 19 and flunking out of college with $25k in student loans because they never learned to self-regulate and prioritize. Maybe it still makes sense for the younger two, but your son is 16, gets good grades and is responsible. You’re showing him that you don’t actually trust him to make good decisions or be able to handle things on his own. I’d loosen up with him, and let him have it in the evenings until bedtime as long as he maintains an agreed upon GPA. And then if he’s doing well with that, then letting him keep it full time as long as the agreed upon expectations are being met."
3,arooyg,t2_ub2zo,miladyelle,"YTA. They’re not preschoolers. They need to know how to self regulate. Micro manage them and they’ll go buck wild once they get away from you. Your job as a parent at this point in their lives is to teach them how to be independent adults. Your current strategy is teaching them that they are eternal children, and mommy controls the children, so let’s wait until we’re away from mommy, and they’ll act like out of control kids. Saw it over and over at university. "
3,arooyg,t2_2qs7wcd5,GloomyBaby4,"YTA. Coming from a 21 year old with a good parental relationship. By not letting them have free reign of their electronics, you're teaching them that you don't trust them, which will cause a lot of issues now and later on. If you've parented them well, you should be able to trust that they won't do wrong and that they'll use the skills (mentally and physically) that you've taught them in order to be well rounded teenagers. My parents showed trust in me from an early age, as well as mutual respect, which is why I believe our relationship is so good. I'm not saying I never slipped up, but with their trust and support, it was a lot easier to come back from my mistakes and not resent them or fear them. Not to mention the internet is full of information and could definitely enhance their learning experience. I learned so much from being able to google anything at any moment, as well as it helping me immensely with my school work. You're going to inspire your children to rebel, and you don't want that, I'm sure. I can also tell you that this is definitely going to or already is putting a strain on your relationship, and their friends definitely think you're an asshole (not that that necessarily matters to you, but this stuff does spread). "
3,arooyg,t2_364glt,Nuova_Hexe,"YTA - I was about to say NTA because you wrote kids and I pictured 5-10 year olds, then I got to the part where your youngest is 13. Give them their damn phones already, if you're so worried then just make it a rule that if they slip their grades then you'll take the phones back (only of the one whose grades slipped, it's unfair to punish everyone for only one's mistake, grades aren't a team effort). Seriously, you're only fostering resentment, your kids are going to grow feeling like you don't trust them and in turn won't trust you back. They're teen/pre-teens already, they can handle teen/pre-teen responsibilities like not being on their phone all day. "
3,arooyg,t2_sz7im,alphakari,">They argue that since their grades and behaviour are good (which is true, most of the time), they shouldnt be ""punished"". Im worried that if they are allowed to use their stuff they will start slipping at school. YTA Their point is accurate. If they have places to improve, like you need them to be better about chores or something, I'd understand. But not even giving them the chance to earn their electronics makes you kinda an asshole. Do they even have a form of staving boredom off in the house? Board games? The ""all my friends have"" thing is a trash argument tho. Don't fall for it. Are the 14 year old and 13 year old even old enough to take transportation to meet their friends and hang out without you playing chauffeur? While I am in favor of holding their entertainment hostage if you can't seem to convince them to want to become adults, it just seems to have no gain here. "
3,arooyg,t2_x0xrm,Bluehorsemoon,"YTA, by their age I'd had a lot of practice setting limits for myself when it came to electronics so I could achieve better academically. You're clearly a very caring, hands-on parent but this strategy sets them up for failure because when they move out, they'll suddenly have unlimited access without having practised self-control. Considering how much they'll have to use electronics in adult life without your oversight, it could have some severe consequences. Self-control has to be learnt by trial and error so protecting them from making bad choices now will only make them learn those lessons when they're adults and can't afford to make as many mistakes. And I would second what everyone's said about it limiting their academic progress, but I assume you're leaving something out about them being allowed to go online on your laptop for schoolwork/research because I doubt you'd keep them away from all the educational material their classmates have access to."

What youre doing now is gonna teach your kids to binge on things they enjoy because they only get such a short amount of time to access these things. You need to come up with a system to help teach them moderation otherwise the second the leave home theyre going to end up not knowing how to moderate themselves on their own and if theyre in college than their grades will end up slipping.

I mean limiting their access to technology during the week could affect more than just their education ( I am 30 and I still google things daily, imagine their curious young minds! ) but it could affect them on a social level and a sexual one. Your son for an example he is 16, his hormones would be raging right about now and he is at a critical point in his live where he is learning to navigate social /romantic scenarios that will stick with him for the rest of his life. Imagine this below hypothetical scenario between a boy who mum bans technology on weeknights for a reason ( I honestly can't think of a good one unless they've shown a record of abusing it) and a girl who liked him. Example exchange: &#x200B; In class on phones &#x200B; Mary: ""Hey Bob! why didn't you reply to my msgs last night when I suggested we should go to the movies some time, I thought you liked me!?"" Bob: ""Sorry Mary, I do my mum just took phone off me so I couldn't respond"" Mary: ""Oh man, I hate it when my parents take my phone off to try and punish me, it's the worse! What did you do to get in trouble?"" Bob: ""Nothing, my mum just refuses to let use any kind of technology on weeknights, think it will mess us up and make us bad people or something, she takes our phones and locks them away"" Mary: .... Bob: ""What? "" no response, unread. Bob: Hello? Msg from APP: ""This person no longer seems to be connected"" &#x200B; Later on, Bob sees, Marry in the lunch room and approaches her &#x200B; Bob: ""Hey Mary! Sorry about earlier, I think my phones playing up it said we were no longer connected I don't think my messages got through, I just wondering if you'd still interested in seeing a movie with me, I was thinking about maybe we could go thursday night?"" Mary: "" Sure your mum will let you? I mean Movies are a technology which is apparently evil and how would we get ahold of each other to meet up if you don't have a phone?"", the cinmeas would be packed! Sorry I have plans to uh wash my hair on thursday night anyway! &#x200B; and then she walks off with her friends while her friend are giggling at poor old bob because they get the context of her response because she told them all about dear old tiger mum. &#x200B; In that scenario, dear old Mum not only cock blocked her son but potentially made him a social pariah &#x200B; I am not Parent, so I am far from an expert but I am a son and I have been a 16 year old teenager.

Phones and other electronics can be a distraction, but they need to learn to manage this distraction on their own. The only thing that you're draconian policy is doing is depriving them of a valuable life skill: self discipline. They can't learn not to spend hours on their phones instead of studying if you confiscate their phones all the time. They're not going to be in your house forever. Eventually they'll move out and have to regulate their own phone usage, and have no experience doing so. I know you're trying to help but all you're doing is seeing them up for failure later in life.

They aren’t going to be able to get off the internet to go to work. This is like the parent that never lets their kid eat junk food, ever, then the kid goes crazy in college. Teach your kid that having a little candy every once in a while or spending a couple of hours on the computer isn’t going to kill them, but that overdoing it can cause serious problems. I think It’s fine if you don’t want them to have the tech overnight... I think that’s reasonable, or maybe just asking them to show you completed homework before getting access to their phones.

Setting some time limitations (such as no later than 11 for the older child, knock it back an hour for the younger ones), and simply punish them if their grades significantly drop.

3,arooyg,t2_1iy9o78q,ClumsyYeti,"YTA. There's a huge amount of middle ground between letting your kids have the electronics 24/7 and taking them away as soon as they get home. Think about it this way, why not teach them to use them in moderation? Say, an hour or two of playstation/laptop if all the homework/chores are done that day and grades are decent or something. And if they prove that they can't stick to those limits/keep their grades up \*then\* go back to limiting them again. What happens when they move out to live on their own for the first time? Unless your son constantly meets his friends outside/does team sport or stuff - online is where a lot of socialising happens these days, he's probably feeling left out/like he's being isolated. Also, I just noticed the ages. Your kids are old enough to learn how to use their devices responsibly. If this was about a younger kid that had a history of acting out and bad grades - ok, maybe. But one of your kids is 16, you say they have good grades.. Why such strict limits? If you're **really** concerned about the internet you could look into parental controls, for your younger kids (though personally I'm glad my parents never did that, I was a mature enough kid to have a good idea of what was ok/not ok to do - but obviously you know your kids best)"

Setting boundaries for usage and standing firm in your punishments are fine but you can't limit your kids necessary (yes, necessary) electronics for fear that they *might* abuse it or their grades start slipping.

If you intend on changing the rules in your household as a result of the answers given here be transparent with your kids on why you're changing the rules. Use the words ""I was/we were wrong"" and apologize for punishing them without reason; explain why you believed the way you did initially and then explain how you realized you were wrong.

3,arooyg,t2_2i0hn5pv,jordannross,"YTA ur punishing them for no reason.. during this time of their lives connecting with friends is VITAL I can’t imagine not being able to text my friends after I had a hard day after school or go online. Your depriving them for no reason... maybe if it was just the phones or just the laptop It wouldn’t be that bad, but no internet, phones or video games why are u being so evil kids need outlets to let out their teen angst. When ur a depressed teen or trying to find yourself the internet is ur best friend. Ur not allowing them to have a outlet and they will rebel sooner or later. They’ll probably get a burner phone or a iPad and hide it from u that’s what most teens do when their parents are this strict your setting yourself up for failure give them their technologies. I hope u see the other comments and decide to I feel bad for ur kids I honestly do. What if ur kids are in a really sad or depressed state they need to be able to contact their friends to let off steam, or to express their opinions what if they’re bullied at school or rumors about them are circulating at school. That’s something kids don’t talk to their parents about and need to talk to their friends about their feelings and ur preventing them of this. Mental heath is a huge issue among teens and teens have a high suicide rate. "
3,arooyg,t2_16ms18,Joey101937,"YTA the world is shifting more and more towards a ubiquitous internet; your parenting style is actually going to end up HARMING them in the long run when they finally grow up and enter a world where all their peers are 3 times as experienced as they are with electronics, navigating around questionable websites, downloading different tools, and general online information. "
3,arooyg,t2_zhustf4,laskullazazz,"YTA, but you obviously have good intentions. This practice is setting them up for failure. If the kids are planning on going college, they will have to police themselves on their device usage and if they weren't able to learn how while they still had someone to tell them ""no"", they're going to have a hard time. If they're staying at home while they attend school, then this is also a no go, I frequently get after hours messages regarding school, and while some of it could wait till the next day, some of it can't. There's also online homework, homework help, and group projects, and this could impact their grades. You won't be able to help them with their schooling at that level, unless you're a professional in that field, and if your kids can't coordinate in group projects, then how will they know what to do?"
3,arooyg,t2_avs3sro,Suq_Maidic,"YTA and you're being far too controlling. Letting your kids use technology isn't going to ruin their grades or change their behavior. Taking away electronics can work as a disciplinary measure if they *do* start struggling, but you're preemptively punishing them for something they haven't even done yet. How do your children communicate with their friends? Do they live nearby? Can your son drive? I had a long distance friend in high school and texting was the only way we could communicate. If you're restricting that contact, then you're an even bigger asshole."
3,arooyg,t2_i1m38,izzgo,"YTA in my opinion because you're keeping your children from growing with the world they're growing up into. For many generations now, including mine and yours, kids have grown up into a world their parents barely knew how to live in. You don't help them succeed in that new world by keeping them from the tools and skills central to it. All kids have to learn how to navigate the world they grow up into, not so much their parents' world. I could see supervised access in the evenings, so you can see how they're coping emotionally and intellectually. Are they deserting real life for video games, or can they play for an hour then join the family for dinner (for instance)? Are they learning many ways of using the internet, or do they find 1 or 2 favorite past times and ignore the rest? You can't guide them in this computer world if you don't see them using it."
3,arooyg,t2_f43oi,Jootmill,YTA they’re not small children. Using the internet is how teenagers communicate and they risk missing out on things with their friends by you doing this. Why not take their phones away if their grades should slip and maybe make it so they don’t go online after 11pm or something instead?
3,arooyg,t2_krtbw,LaoSh,"YTA, the only time it's acceptable to judge kids on how they are spending time is if you are willing to give them an alternative. Did you consider taking them to the park or the beach or sitting with them and studying or working on a project? If you just took their devices and then left them to their own... devices, you accomplished nothing but used up an ""arsehole parent"" token that should have been saved for when they were acting out. It also sounds like this came out of no where which is not good developmentally. It diminishes their trust in you and they will be more likely to lie or deceive you in the future. Limiting screen time can be a very effective behavioural tool but you need to set proper boundaries. i.e. ""If your grades drop below X you will be limited to 30 minutes of screen time a night beyond what is needed for school"" but this has to be framed as a punishment for a pre-defined outcome. You also need to provide regular feedback on the progress of this punishment. Pop their teachers an email and ask them to keep you up to date with your kid's progress in class and slowly start giving back more screen time if the teacher reports an improvement. And you still need to provide a stimulating alternative, you are the parent, not the screen. Also, phones are a very valuable communication tool for people that age. You and I might have socialised face to face but kids communicate electronically, you are cutting them out of their friends lives by doing this and will harm their social development. Source: Is teacher. &#x200B;"
3,arooyg,t2_929px,Jaywearspants,"I mean you’re the parent so it’s your call but in my eyes YTA - that solves absolutely nothing and would lead to me resenting you if you were my parent. Limiting electronic usage is good, banning it 5 days a week is insane. I don’t see any reason to not allow kids of that age time to enjoy themselves. Not to mention that 16 year olds are nearly adults and are learning how to be social and establish long lasting friendships and that’s impossible this way. So yeah. YTA I hope this thread changes your mind and your children get treated a little better "
3,arooyg,t2_1acbkrnx,MountainLou,"YTA ish. i'd say 16 was old enough to have a phone during the week, as long as it doesn't impact his home study. Your girls I'm less sure about. How about they get them for an hour after dinner. Help them to learn time management with their phone. Do o it as a family, have a family phone box, where everyones phones go (including yours) for certain times of the day."
3,arooyg,t2_32m9yvcu,KrazyKatz3,YTA 100%. Where is your trust in your children? If you want to be cautious set grade goals and if they don't make them confiscate appliances. Punishing your children like this for what you admit is no reason is going to lead to a lot of resentment. 
3,arooyg,t2_2ze5g0tg,Kellogz27,"INFO What is the reason you take the phones away? If there's no real reason, then YTA. I'll copy and edit what I said in another comment here: Discipline always has a bigger goal in mind. It's never the end goal. For example, when someone grabs a child by the arm because they are screaming inside a store, the grab is the disciplinairy action. The grab is not the ultimate goal. The goal is for the child to stop screaming. The goal is a change in behavior to be positive. By taking away the electronics without any good reason, you're not really serving a bigger goal. They are behaving like they should, grades are good etc so why have a displinary action? What do you want to teach your childeren? you're basically saying: ''don't do the most effective thing to complete your daily tasks, because potatoes.'' If the goal is to teach her childeren how to use technology correctly, this is counterproductive. It's not teaching them how to use the technology, it's just taking it away. They are not learning how to use it effectively, for no reason whatsover. It would be different if they were on their phones 24/7 or their grades got really bad etc, but that's not happening. I've never understood parents who take away electronics without reason and parents who give childeren unlimited acces from a very young age. Both of those things can be bad. You can actually teach childeren a lot about technology if you do this together. Keep a eye on what they are doing online, set some small boundaries and be ready to help them when things go bad. That's something that the childeren learn from and makes them better in using technology and being a better adult."
3,arooyg,t2_2oxw45vo,nepsola,"NTA, but I think there is room for some middle ground. For instance, why not give your kids access to tech (the reward they want) at a certain time each night, like once they've completed their homework? Why not have a thing where they come home from school, everyone's phones are dropped in a drawer or something (including yours), while they do homework and you all have dinner, then their evenings are free to spend as they please? Not as this strict enforced rule, but as a ""tech detox"" rather than a complete technology ban. EDIT - Also, to add. You'd be better off giving them the chance to learn to regulate their technology usage now. Because as some others have mentioned, strict rules can lead to severe rebellion later on. When they go to university or move out and get jobs (whatever it is for them), they are way more likely to binge on tech because they have the freedom to do so. Whereas if you can instil in them a healthy relationship with technology, and one that they actually come to appreciate, they are more likely to do well with that as adults."
3,arooyg,t2_2kqby8ow,docmahi,"NTA - The rule in our house was no electronics on weekdays, it was just how I grew up and frankly I thought everyone was the same until I was a teenager, ultimately its your house and your rules. &#x200B; I will say this though - when I went to college I had a hard time studying because of all the freedom and being able to do whatever I wanted during the week. I had never learned out to budget my time so to speak because electronics and basically things that werent sports and studying were banned during the week. It lead to me fucking up my first to years of college pretty bad. Eventually I sorted my shit out and got to medschool anyways but it added a few years to my road and I think a big part of it was that I got all that freedom all at once. "

Ignore these brainwashed weirdos and stick with what's working. Edit: I'm assuming you pay for these devices? That makes them yours.

3,arooyg,t2_9pximj0,corgarian,"NTA. Your house your rules. When I was in high school (early 2000s) personal phones were just becoming a thing. I wasnt allowed to have one till I was 17. My mother also had a 30min timer per day on the computer. Once 30 .in was up the computer would shut down and could t be logged back in until the next day. If your kids need to do research they can stay after school and use the library. If they need help on their homework they can stay after school for tutoring. There is literally NOTHING that would require your children to NEED an electronic device while they are home. That being said maybe you could use the devices as a reward for their good grades. ""Keep making A's and I'll give you an hour of device time after dinner."""

You’re allowed to want to be with someone who doesn’t have a problem with drinking. And while I’m not going to outright say dump him with no further thought or discussion with him, there is something to consider here though. You said yourself that he stopped drinking, then when he started drinking again that he started falling into “old habits.” The key word there is habits. Even if he stops drinking while you two fix things, what’s to stop the habits from returning once you give him the “okay” to drink a bit again? I don’t know how severe the issue is, but I will say this: there’s a reason people who have addictions have to stay sober from any and all addictive substances; it’s generally not something that is cured or goes away.

A mother is not supposed to be the reason for her child's heartbreak but she is and no matter how many chances i have given or excuses i have made, she hasn't changed. And she never will.

Don’t turn into a JUSTNO relative. If you don’t think she’s cut out for the role then it’s a lack of faith and trust on your part. Age is also irrelevant to parenthood. I had my oldest at 19 and have done a fairly decent job. Let her make her own choices.

Unless you truly feel your daughter is unfit to be a parent, then this is complete bs, and frankly, you suck as a person. That child deserves to be loved, your daughter deserves to be with a man who makes her happy, and when you love someone, you accept any ""baggage"" that may come along with that. I'm sorry, but you need to grow up. Edit: Just as a btw, moving in after only a year, especially when a child is involved does seem a little quick, maybe.

3,a6jc38,t2_n1358ha,commando_potato,"I’m a bit unsure. I think that anyone else could’ve given up their seat instead of them harassing you though. I don’t think you’re wrong for keeping the seat because you were studying. Her shitty friend seems like she just wanted to start something. If you weren’t actually studying and just kind of sitting there, YTA. Some people can’t tolerate pain or standing for long periods of time. Swelling feet and cramps full time suck.

The only reason for you to go is to support your wife and she is saying she is fine on her own. If you want to go out with her another night, ask her, then get a babysitter. But that night is her, to relax with her co-workers and network. So why is this night important to you? I think o am planning to YTA for expecting to be invited to something you know you don't enjoy and your SO knows you don't enjoy because.... principles? "
3,a0gx48,t2_q1b7igf,MrsMinnesota,I don't know why you used italics on offered. A loan is a loan and her sister was very very generous to wait this long to call in the debt.

3,b47k4y,t2_15vv9u3l,Dawn36,"NTA. I have a friend that was in a similar situation. She had one child, finally left the guy, and immediately started dating another idiot, that was somehow worse than the first! She found out she was pregnant, called me, I offered to pay for the abortion, she could not afford this child! Then she thought he should know about it, he blew a bunch of pretty smoke up her stupid ass...and within 6 months after the baby was born, dude is in the wind and she now has two kids to support. I no longer offer any assistance to her. "
3,alvy2p,t2_1xvbr4my,letmebe03,"NTA, and can I just say that you are extremely mature to be a teenager? I do applaud your efforts to be there for her, but I do think you could have done that without being in a relationship with her, which might have led her on just a bit. With that said, you are not a mental health professional, and you don't OWE anyone that responsibility. It truthfully sounds like she needs to seek professional help. Don't take that as a criticism so much as a reminder that you don't have to act as someone's personal psychologist. Take care of yourself as well, as you are about to enter a transitional period in your life and need to focus on yourself and your future. Best of luck to you!"
3,9v4byn,t2_914nb,cyberchief,"> she owes me the communication of whether or not she’s coming home and when she expects to be home (AITA there?). Your house, your rules. NTA. If you change the locks, NTA towards your ex, but YTA towards the son who is unfortunately in the middle of this situation. This would be easy if not for her son because as you said, her son did nothing wrong and makes it a difficult decision. It sounds like you're expected to be his daycare. You have to find a safe way to offload your responsibility for the kid. I don't personally have experience with CPS but maybe that is an option?"
3,9v4byn,t2_grct7,MontRouge,NTA right now but just tell her directly if you don't want her in your home instead of going behind her back like that. Give her a deadline for example. I understand during the week-end it can be annoying and disrespectful since she makes you watch over her son but why do you want to know what is she doing during the weekdays?.
3,as6ij3,t2_15z6yu,KAbNeaco,"NTA, but talk with your mom. Your dad wanted you to earn the money for it so that'd you'd cherish it, and your sister didn't contribute so there's no reason she should cherish the PS4. If I were in your shoes I'd say I'm perfectly willing to let my sister play with the PS4, but I have doubts about how well she will take care of it and then ask my mother what would happen if the PS4 was broken through no fault of my own. Essentially, get a family approved insurance plan for your stuff. Don't be demanding, you're just a concerned PS4 owner. You also better be prepared to buy some games that your sister can play (luckily the LEGO franchise is genuinely fun), its not entirely fair, but your folks buy DVDs for you yeah? "
3,b8qalq,t2_10xh1q,DClawdude,"NTA. Live your best life, fuck those people. You don't owe them shit. It's nice of you to help your mom a little but I personally would not do any favors to an organization that basically shunned me for my own identity. Let me be clear, your mom really isn't much of an asshole unless she knows this story and keeps making asks of you with this group that treated you terribly. If she doesn't know, consider telling her. She may not want to be associated with them if she knows this. If she does know, don't feel any guilt stopping since she basically picked continuing to help them after they treated her own child like shit. If you're passionate about volunteering with middle school kids, I am sure there are other orgs around for this, potentially even some that are LGBTQ+ focused for queer youths. It's hard to be in middle school, it's even harder to be LGBT and in middle school "
3,b8qalq,t2_tcwbi7,brandyto,"Nta. You generously volunteered your time and were essentially told to not be who you are in order to keep volunteering.

You haven’t asked your mother to choose between you and the church, you simply do not wish to go somewhere that doesn’t welcome you for who you are. I’m sorry you are in this situation."
3,b6yesp,t2_f4vrj,Hendejr1206,"NTA She needs a therapist to work with her since all she's even known is abuse. I know you're trying to help, but she clearly sees this as combative which is doing no good. PS, the boyfriend sounds like a complete douche and if he's legitimately death threating her than police need to know. Document everything and turn him in."
3,b6yesp,t2_3b7l9acc,bored_german,"I had a friend like that. I get that the worst thing for an abuse victim is to lose friends over it but she's basically forcing you to do all this emotional labour for her while barely giving anything back. In the long run, this is going to mess with your mental health. It certainly did for me. You either need to have a long, serious conversation like adults (she thinks she's able to be a mother, she should be able to behave like an adult) or you need to leave this friendship."
3,ar7pf6,t2_1m3h7gi5,fliffers,"NTA for the immediate issue at hand. Consent can be reversed and if you did not like being tied up you had every right and more to be untied. She should have done it immediately and never blamed you or made you feel like you cannot or should not withdrawal consent for her sake. Unrelated to that event though, you come off as an asshole for sex in general. I think she probably wanted to spice things up because she feels that she literally never has control during sex, and wanted to be able to do it how she wanted once. That's probably why she took you changing your mind so hard (which again is absolutely no excuse at all for her behavior). However....sex shouldn't revolve around your dick. She has a vagina, and it should be just as much the center of attention. You both have mouths and hands and genitals...I count six things there that you can mix and match for sex and many of those combinations don't involve your dick. My boyfriend is trans so there isn't a dick between us and (surprise !) we manage to have great sex that revolves around both of us. If you are willing to work past her crossing your boundaries, you should take the time to ask her if she's happy with your sex life, and feels like she gets what she wants. If she meant that she fakes it for you, it's something I'd be concerned about because you should not be okay with the idea that she's sucking it up or faking it so that you enjoy sex. Edit: spelling "
3,ar7pf6,t2_6l659,Jo3yA,"NTA - Sex in all it's forms should only be performed under informed consent. At any time before or during you are in your full right to withdraw consent, for any reason. It is never supposed to be for one part to just ""suck it up"" or ""take one for the team"". If you are not feeling it, you owe it to both of you to withdraw consent. She on the other hand is out of line, you were clearly uncomfortable, unwilling and more importantly, withdrew your consent. Instead of her going off on you for not ""attempting"" to like it, she should have sat down with you, listened and asked questions without putting any blame on either of you as you explained what it was about the experience that turned you off, why you don't like it, and if there is some way to change it up to make it interesting to you."
3,akeb1y,t2_e7wdu,DRanged691,NTA. You are being considerate of your neighbors and trying to come up with a solution that both allows for the cat to be outside and for the neighborhood birds and squirrels not to be the cat's victims. 
3,akeb1y,t2_2inaj3en,meysic,"NTA, though I think I remember reading somewhere that some cats learn how to hunt around the bell. Honestly it might be really hard convince them but the best option would be to stop letting the cat outside. A cat should not be killing things everyday, it's pretty bad for the local animal population. The cat will probably feel cooped up at first and be a menace but if they have a scratching post, a spot or two they can sit and look out the window, and you play with them, they'll learn to stay inside. "
3,akeb1y,t2_gbvr2,Babbit_B,"NTA *However*, cats learn to walk silently even wearing a bell, and keeping her inside may not be a humane option if she's always been an indoor/outdoor cat. It sucks, but it's in a cat's nature to kill small animals. The best solution I can suggest is for the neighbours to use something to deter cats from their back yards. Something as simple as lemon juice can work with some cats - mine loathes citrus so much that he'll bite me if I use bath products with citrus in them!"
3,akeb1y,t2_30yaewd1,penguindandee,"NTA - I love cats! What are the rules where you live for outdoor cats? Because where I live we're not really allowed to have outdoor cats (people still do it though) but they can be called to the local animal shelter/humane society and the owners can be dealt with that way. But to answer the question, no it's not an asshole move to put a bell on a cat and your dads gf should be more considerate of where shes now living (in a new neighborhood where people are getting upset about this)"
3,ao5vlb,t2_aee7w,avacash,"NTA. For two reasons: First, there's 'definitely some shit going down over there', in your own words. It sounds like there might be verbal abuse, at the very least, and maybe more, since you can only hear it, not see it. So, it is the right thing to do to alert the authorities to your concerns. Second, they're causing what sounds like a pretty major, continuous disturbance in the place where you live. Look up the noise restriction guidelines in your area- most likely, you can report this as a disturbance, and they will receive a visit, if not a citation, to address the issue. At the very least, you can take this first step to actually have a peaceful home."
3,addlha,t2_2v85r5jh,Yellowbird1980,"NTA and I’m struggling to understand why people are giving you a hard time. The tax in question was clearly related to your husbands business, of which you had absolutely no involvement. He looks after his business and you look after your joint responsibilities at home. That seems fair to me, it also isn’t news that people who work pay tax, we all pay tax if we earn over a certain amount so I don’t think naivety is at play here. If you have no access to the business how on earth did he think you were paying the taxes? This is a fuck up of monumental proportions and I think you want him to acknowledge this, not unreasonable. Please don’t give up your PHD or do anything rash.......... you own a home, can you get a loan for part or all of the amount? Not ideal I know but better than selling your house, and this may bring the repayments down. If you can’t afford the repayments you need to talk to them again. DO NOT QUIT THE PHD. As for your relationship, I don’t know, it would bother me too.... you need to talk and tell him how you feel. "
3,addlha,t2_sz7im,alphakari,"* Editted my verdict from the top so it doesn't get counted, as I changed my verdict. I originally said everyone sucks here tho. Doesn't really matter whose fault it is, and you both suck for blaming each other like it does matter. It's not like this is a mistake you guys will make twice, so why does it matter who made it first? EDIT: I think it's NTA based on the convo I think making the situation to me that she's pissed about what it means that he doesn't take ANY responsibility for what happened (by my understanding at least). Which makes it less rabble rousy than just being pissed about who did it. "
3,addlha,t2_1kcllzhe,Knupsel,"I’ll play devils advocate here and say YTA. Hear me out, you said the man works RIDICULOUS hours already, and you take his money every cheque, correct? So he has no money, since you control and take care of the finances. It’s not his business’ tax that’s outstanding, it’s the personal tax, which means that’s part of the household’s finances, which you manage, no? If you take the cheque as soon as it comes in, how is he supposed to pay for something if he doesn’t have control of the money? On a different note, you said he made good money, how is it that a couple thousand dollars are almost putting you guys into bankruptcy? If you control the finances, and he makes good money, shouldn’t you have also been putting money aside?"
3,b3ujn6,t2_21t55rvf,Farlyfjord,"YTA. She might have sleep paralysis. Which is a terrifying disorder. Look it up and educate yourself on it (it’s very interesting) And even if it’s just a nightmare you’re TA for getting angry at her instead of just being supportive. Yeah, she probably should have responded sooner, but she sounds like she was terrified. So just try to be understanding in the future and talk about how she should respond at a later time not when she’s freaked out. "
3,b751z6,t2_3etuw5uv,aly38,"YTA- I have two younger sisters, aged 14 and 8 and I also live with my boyfriend. Now let me just say, my sisters can be absolute little shits sometimes. I can also be a little shit when I'm with them, for example, when we all go to my grandma's, we wrestle with each other and her dog. We have our inside jokes and such. My boyfriend welcomes them spending time over at our place, and he just games in his room while we watch movies together. In fact, he's helping me put together a mini-Wrestlemania party for me and my 14 year old sister. But he does sometimes think they're annoying and even gets onto us for how obnoxious we're acting. But he'd never say that they couldn't come over because he knows they're important to me because my family is important to me and I like spending time with them. It would honestly be a deal breaker for me if my family wasn't allowed over for no good reason. Your reasons seem to be you feel left out of probably 20+ year old jokes, you don't like their impressions, and you don't like her sister because your personalities clash. Depending on how often she comes over, I can see asking her to cut back a bit. But saying if she sees her sister once a month, that her sister can't step foot in your apartment just because you don't like her, it's not something that would go over well with most people. If I were you, I'd just start asking for like 3+ notice that she's coming over so I could have plans and if she's still there when I come home, greet her briefly and head to bed. "
3,b751z6,t2_1dss259n,egalex,YTA they're sisters for goodness sake they've been with each other their entire lives of corse they're going to have inside jokes and references also its her apartment too you have no right to ban her sister from coming over

I’d suggest you talk to the management and let them know you don’t want a cake, no hard feelings. Seems like a good way to celebrate birthdays is to do it once a month and combine. That way, you’re spreading the attention, and less time is wasted celebrating birthdays. They really do get old after awhile. Edit: the above makes it so you don’t have to take a sick day. Don’t cheat yourself of sick days, it’s not fair to yourself."
3,b9ymhl,t2_2zi8oo1z,lexen3997,"NTA. Lower Status? Obviously these assholes were influenced by the idea that black women lower the quality of a music video. I saw the video about 6-7 years ago(my memory is shit, don't quote me on time or exact wording) where artist would sexualize black women in the beginning of their career, and once they became more well known would upgrade to other models, as black women lowered the quality of their music videos. Honestly there's a problem with how black women in general are treated and dismissed as lesser. Sometimes even by their Male counterparts. Just sad. OP this was a clearly racist comment, to have the other guys agree only makes it worse. Don't surround yourself with these idiots. "
3,b72w8f,t2_68001,Marinaisgo,"NTA - Your parents are harming you by not respecting your boundaries. This is going to effect your ability to form trusting, healthy relationships as an adult, and it's not going to prevent anything from happening to you, which is probably the reason they give for being so nosy. Nosiness didn't stop your dad from cheating from your mom, did it? Do what you can to preserve your privacy, if you keep a journal, destroy the pages after you've written them. It's important to have a private life. You're growing up, and eventually will have to exist outside your parents and your family, whether they like it or not. Don't mistake the fact that they feed you and don't physically harm you for them being good parents. They probably want to be good parents, almost everyone does. But they're getting it wrong. "

If you take your diet seriously you already should have been. Second, you are assuming that her actions are why you feel sick without having taken any action to verify that. It's likely that she's cleaned the kitchen after cooking in it (Obviously, since you didn't know she was doing this) and it's highly unlikely that the mere presence of flour has had such a severe effect over such a long period. If it has though, you still have no right to be making demands of her when she is already sacrificing for you. >I attend university and don't have enough money to move out This is a common meme among University students. Yes you can. You just don't want to because it will be hard, require a lot of work and you won't keep the same standard of living you have right now. So let's recap. * You blew up at her when you don't know for certain that she's the problem * You did this based on a thin premise that doesn't really stand up to scrutiny * You called her inconsiderate, selfish and a ""terrible person"" despite the fact that she is letting you live with her * You destroyed her food after the fact * You aren't taking responsibility for your own health and are instead bullying her into catering to you despite the fact that she is letting you live with her Also, >I was feeling really helpless, exhausted and desperate As you screamed abuse at an old woman. >and my symptoms were severe so that added to my anger So of course you can't be responsible for your behavior. >cross- contamination can't be eliminated and it was constantly making me sick. This is, flat out, fundamentally not true. I'm going to attribute this comment to ESL rather than ignorance. Honestly I have some choice words for you but based on this paragraph size look into your life, you are the asshole. Not just in this instance but just in general.

She needs a long, serious talking to, and it sounds like you've given it your all and she still isn't listening. It's my personal belief that keeping it together in a difficult conversation is important, which is why I see a little bit of ESH. If you can phrase your anger with a cool temper, it lends you strength and credence, and helps the other person keep a clear head.

They agreed you could live with them and have that room for a while; that means treating the person living in it with basic decency. The fact that your parents pay the bills doesn't give them a free pass to enter what you both agreed would be your personal space. If they don't want you to stay with them, they can tell you to leave. Imagine other scenarios: what if you allow a friend to live with you in your apartment for a time because they have a difficult time; would it give you a free pass to go into their room (a room you voluntarily agreed to let them use) even against they *specifically* told you not to come in?"

I think it has more to do with her struggles as being a woman, there are people who kinda lose themselves (men also) in that struggle and end up seeing that everything is wrong in modern society (the way that character dresses for example) and since they can’t solve all the problems they lose their shit, it’s a real problem; I’ve heard of women who can’t trust a single man so they’re always up for a fight and acting defensively and even aggressively, that’s really tiresome and could ruin their social relations with people, specially men. But you kinda lost yourself as well and went the asshole way, she drew you out, it takes a lot of patience to know something is wrong and act accordingly specially when you’re being taunted. But I understand how frustrating it must have been (for both of you actually). Clearly you guys are not okay, it’s like something is wrong in the relationship and nobody really knows what it is or don’t have the guts to address it (it’s a snow ball that wrecks communication, which is very important on a relationship), so you guys keep arguing about to see if it leads to the discovery point of talking things out. And for all I know you could’ve started the discussion (in a more soft way) that culminated on the events you described at that specific day, something you asked just like her, insinuating and being presumptive to externalize your angst.

The fact that you attempted to contact the friend in multiple ways throughout the timeline shows that you were trying and you do care.

3,av4so5,t2_93qs1,black_eyed_susan,"NTA - even if it was 2x. Welcome to tech. People come and go all the time. The average tenure right now is \~2 years I believe, but I've worked with people who have been out the door in under 6 months for a better opportunity. You don't owe the company anything. You need to do what is best for you and 5x is a HUGE pay raise. Long term you can save better for your retirement. It would be silly not to explore an opportunity like that. Honestly it just means you're underpaid at your current role. "
3,av4so5,t2_yjb8dmd,landersclocks,"NTA to the current company’s bosses, and potentially YTA to the friend who recommended you but you can try to mitigate this. To the current bosses. NTA. Business is business sometimes. Just be professional and honest about it, apologize for the inconvenience you know you’ve caused them and that this should by no means reflect badly on your friend who recommended you, and explain the reason why you’re quitting. In business and as people mature, people understand everyone needs to make a living and pays bills. A little YTA to the friend who recommended you. But, I think if quit, just tell your current bosses by no means should this reflect badly on your friend. Also, talk to your friend when you quit so they don’t feel resentful they went to bat for you and you quit so soon. Explain the same thing — 5x was just too good to pass up and the finances will really impact your life in an incredibly positive way right now. "
3,av4so5,t2_1nkisos2,Whiskey_hotpot,"Yta. You should still take that offer. But you are screwing over that other company, or at least the people who hired you. They at least invested time and energy into getting you on board, and leaving in under 1 year is probably not fair. But if it is really 5x... or even 2x the salary, you take it. I've had this situation happen to me, as a manager. I hired someone, he found a much better offer in about 6 months and he left. While I understood his decision, it screwed me over and I ended up working longer hours (and I am on salary) for months until se could replace him. "
3,av4so5,t2_64okfqd,CNNWillBlackmailYou,"NTA - I was actually going to warn you against doing this at first (being in the programming field myself, and knowing what kinds of things we look at when hiring). There's costs involved in spinning up a new employee (you have to figure the first month is basically onboarding, then the last 2 weeks are short-timer's syndrome). So when you hire a new employee, you can estimate that it takes them working for about a year to ""break even"". So as a rule, when making hiring decisions, I look at a resume to see if someone's a ""job hopper"". (It's a good way to increase your pay, but obviously bad for the company.) For myself, I figure even when doing a contract that I'm fairly certain will be a fail, I'll give them at LEAST a year before moving on. HOWEVER, if the pay is literally FIVE TIMES what you're currently making, AND the job is secure and stable, then there's TWO things happening simultaneously here: 1.) Your current company is grossly underpaying you. 2.) The new job is going to grossly overpay you. So basically, if you're making $50K / yr. now, you're on the very low-end of the spectrum for a programmer. A 5x multiplier on that would put you at $250K. If that's what's on the table, that would be a ""too good to be true"" scenario for me. (I've been doing this for 20 years, and am - not just bragging - one of the top in our field. I only make $175K.) So if they're *honestly* offering 5x the pay, and it's not one of those ""pie in the sky"" offers (like the way my brother always has an idea for a business, but pitches it like I should just quit my job now and join him to make a bajillion dollars) then ***you should absolutely jump on that shit, WTF are you doing on reddit right now?!***"
3,av4so5,t2_dizz1kr,WhyDoIKeepFalling,"NTA fuck company loyalty, you owe them nothing. However, I would caution you to reach out quietly to the guy who quit and find out why he quit. 5x salary sounds awesome, but if it comes at the cost of 70-80 hour weeks, it might not be worth it in my opinion. Also if I know anything about tech, it's super volatile. Companies come and go like dust in the wind. Make sure the company is stable for the long term so they don't close their doors in 6 months and you have to come crawling back to your current employer"

Not knowing how or wanting to handle that is all fine and well, and there's no reason for you to have to stick with him unless you actually want to. He's handling it poorly, as he's more or less indifferent to your response. Even if he is incapable of an emotional attachment, he should recognize and appreciate the value that you bring to his life. Since he's not even feigning empathy for your confusion, he's not putting in effort to help you understand a situation that he himself put you in, which is assholish."

I get that you hit your breaking point, and it sucks that he is forcing you to believe what he believes, but at the same time I assume you live under his rules, rent free etc? Kind of one of those things where you gotta follow your parents rules, if that means going to church on Sundays then you need to. Not because you respect the religion, but because you respect your parents and their rules. This might mean you have to move other things around and prioritize things differently. It sucks you're in this position, and I'm not saying your father isn't in the wrong here also. Your father should be trying to get you to want to find religion, not forcing you to believe. If I were you I would say something along the lines of ""I'm sorry for how I said that, I shouldn't have yelled etc. But that I feel that way and I do not believe in your religion."" I'd also just attend church out of appeasement if I were you, but I'm also very non confrontational. That may come with some consequences, and if you really need to put your foot down and not attend church because of your own beliefs then go ahead, but there can be repercussions, ie him taking away your stuff.

I honestly thought you were getting disrespected and talked down to, but all you had was a “difficult” table. Everyone who works customer service has had to work with “difficult” people, but they’re a far cry from rude/disrespectful people. You didn’t have to publicly shame the guy just because he ran you ragged. If you really wanted to get back at him, you should’ve reacted in a complementary way. He made your life harder, why not just make his life “harder”?? Take a long time to get his food delivered, stall on getting his declined card back to him idk. But instead, you look like the asshole for embarrassing him in a way no one wants to be embarrassed. And you’re also dumb because you screwed your self out of a tip. What did you think was gonna happen??? Also, with how you refer to his friends as his “posse”, him as a “gangsta” rapper (as if any new, up and coming artist still fits that genre), and constantly harp on how they don’t belong in your upscale restaurant, you must have several sticks up your ass.

I’m with another poster, how was the declined card issue going to be resolved without actual communication? Customer chose to take it personally and as an insult (like most of them do, children). And the server got screwed out of his tip. The manager should have comped some of the bill so *some* of that 1200 went to the server. "

Ordering items that are not on the menu and sending them back three times make me never want to serve you again no matter how well you tip.

I think this should be standard policy for folks who can't afford to tip"
3,aopv5x,t2_15xd9c,TmoBeyGee,"NTA. You did your job very well, the dude was a total douche, all you did was let him know his card was decline in a way that he deserved.

It is my guess that everyone that’s typing ‘YTA’ has never worked in the service industry. It’s not like you ‘accidentally’ dropped his food on the floor the 3rd time he sent it back. You did good!"
3,aopv5x,t2_bu85a3o,Louwye,YTA...As someone who has worked in food and customer service for 7 years now it is literally your job to pretend to be nice even when someone is a complete asshat.

3,aopv5x,t2_29gmcdgx,Ekaterina702,"From the wording of your post, you seem really hostile towards this guy and his ""posse"" without outright saying it. Also, when did a $50 a plate establishment become upscale? I guess it depends on where u live, but that's really not important. Every establishment reserves the right to refuse service, so if he and his ""posse"" were throwing bread as one of your comments says, why were they not 1. warned first 2. Asked to leave if not following etiquette. Hopefully this is a SHP, but if not then YTA. Try going into situations with an open mind before casting judgement on your customers. If the situation wasnt a ""rapper and his posse"" but ""a businessman and his colleagues"" would you have reacted the same way??? You say you enjoyed ""making him look stupid"" ...but in the end it was quite the opposite. He left without giving YOU a full payment, withheld YOUR tip, and YOU were reprimanded by your manager."

That is true through all of life, but it’s especially true in high school when you’re not an adult yourself. If she is being abused she needs help you can’t give her. Tell someone what’s happening. I had a friend who met someone at high school who claimed she wanted to kill herself and constantly called him and talked to him all night about the ways she’d kill herself. Eventually his grades where effected because of lack of sleep and he was terrified to leave her alone. Thankfully, he ended up telling his parents who told her parents who got her help.

You both made the decision to not use a condom so it's not all on you with that issue. People take plan B all the time every day it's there for a reason exactly like this when two people fuck up. I don't even see why anyone can blame you for wanting her to take it because if she would've gotten pregnant it would be a shit show for you I'm sure.

None of that matters. You're an adult now and you have to pay your own way. Doesn't matter if other people have better paying jobs, most of them will when you're just starting out. Of course that applies to money you actually owe (like to your mom), not money freely given without any expectation of being paid back (like from your aunt). "

Listen to them, ask them maybe how you can better approach others when seeking emotional support, or just general strategies on supporting oneself internally rather than externally. As others have said, don't worry too much about it as you are still very young, and might actually just grow out of it naturally. Even if you don't really, there are lots of girls who love to provide lots of emotional support, so focus on these types. As an aside, maybe this is generational, but for me high maintenance always meant a partner you had to spend a lot of money on specifically for their appearance.

I'm not saying that you are wrong and that they shouldn't pay you back, but what I am saying is that you expected to be paid back from people who couldn't make payments to begin with. Your daughter's love life is none of your business and if she feels like she wants to stick this out, then so be it. You should leave that right alone. She is your daughter and you should extend the olive branch and come to terms that they are not paying you back. Then also make a mental note not to lend them money again. Stop being offended by your daughter's decisions, they are not yours. When she makes the decision to ask you for money she should also not be offended when you tell her no. Neither of you are assholes. You should just move on and learn from both of your mistakes and stop being childish. Life is too short for you to have this ongoing argument with your daughter.

Still, if as a couple, they are both okay with the brunt of the loan resting on your daughter then that is their decision as a couple to make. If her husband was working and your daughter wasn't, would the criticism be the same or are you just upset because your daughter is attached to someone who isn't the primary provider? Also, it seems unfair to say that he lacks motivation after saying that he continually acquires jobs. He can't continually be getting jobs by accident and they do take time to get. So he's clearly trying."
3,9uouyt,t2_17gma2,BelligerentBenny,"YTA- If she said she was going to pay you back. Then you kept harping about him getting a job TO HER. Yes you were probably in the wrong. Reverse the sexes would have said that? No, and it's 2018. It would have been on your son to pay it back. Now if she's not actually paying you because they just have no money then maybe there is some grey area there. But it wouldn't seem prudent to me to push her about the actions of her husband. If she gave a shit about these things why would she have married him? You're giving her too little credit for her convictions. Clearly she came to the conclusion it doesn't matter he's not a traditional provider or whatever. The time to have this conversation has past you trying to berate her to get him to get a job isn't going to work. Whatever happens best to just leave it alone. Apologize when the opportunity arises, wait for your 100 dollar payments to trickle in . Don't try to use it as leverage, clearly not going to work. The whole money is just an idea thing is troubling, i'd be worried if my hypothetical* kid said that in this context. But that's not what u came here for so GL with that part of it. TLDR - insulting him probably ok as long as it's not pissing your daughter off too much, demanding her spouse get a job? Yea you went way over the line. Reverse the sexes and that should tell you all you need to know. Inappropriate in todays age, although maybe in the not so recent past socially acceptable. "

You don't sound religious, but in the Catholic Church and some other Christian denominations, burying the dead is one of the Corporal Works Of Mercy (for reference others are feeding the hungry, visiting prisoners, shelter the homeless). You are a just and merciful young woman. For you to never speak to your mom at the age of 11, I'm sure she was evil towards you and the ones you loved. Your actions are a testament to the strength of your character. You are a hell of a person. I don't know how you phrased asking for assistance, but did you leave it open ended or did you give them a budget of what you needed? Because funerals can run >$20K without really trying (source, my dad died in the summer). Circle back to every one of them, remind them there were some good times and present a budget of what you still want to spend and what you've already spent and give them an exact number that you want them to contribute. Let them say, they won't contribute $300, $500 $1,000 to help bury your mother. If you can track down any of her friends from the last two years, find out what church she attended, if it's one of the major denominations, reach out to your local and tell them your story and what you want, a reverend coming over to say a few words, give out a blessing, in return you can give him(or her) some coffee and a pastry. (and if that reverend/priest doesn't want to do it just call around to other churches, one will help you out). "

Small talk at least sometimes is necessary for most people its practice, an interview, it keeps the bond when you don't have anything serious to discuss. As far as keeping up with people who have moved or get busy. you don't have to have hours-long conversations, you can communicate via other means etc and your stance will very likely result in you having fewer friends in the future.

You brought food specifically for yourself and your daughter, it’s not like you came in insulting what else was being served or expected her to cater to you. Next time you’re at a meal with them, I’d just serve your daughter yourself. "

Probably just result in an argument. Im not vegan or vegetarian but I totally respect people who are. As long as your daughter is thriving there is no problem. She is your daughter and your her mother you know whats best for her, and you seem to be completely open to her making her own choices when she reaches that age.

3,abms7w,t2_dogjb,greenpinkie,NTA and MIL was out of line but consider relaxing the restrictions until your daughter can make her own informed choices. I was raised strict vegetarian and wish I had eaten meat occasionally as a kid. It’s not an option for me to make a different choice now due to both aversions and not having developed the ability to digest meat as a child. It’s led to some problems when travelling and living overseas in less veg friendly settings and missing opportunities to take part in social and culinary activities that I’d otherwise have really enjoyed. I’m also now pregnant with twins and there is evidence that the smaller of the two would benefit from a super high protein diet but I’m struggling to get the protein in. If I could eat meat it would be much easier!

She's only five, she didn't need to know."
3,abms7w,t2_qrfkb,cautionjaniebites,"NTA &#x200B; But I do think you're overly upset. There will be accidental animal byproduct consumption in her life. You have to learn to shake it off, not make a big deal out of it that will upset your daughter, and then move on. That's not saying you shouldn't be upset with your bf's mother. What she did was underhanded and unacceptable. If you approach her again about it, there will be problems. She clearly doesn't respect the lifestyle choices you've made for yourself and daughter. So she will not apologize and will only throw insults to protect her flawed reasoning. Do you really want to put your bf in the position of being in the middle? If I were you, I'd take the high road and not discuss it again. Then in the future, not go to her family events and if she attends yours, be diligent that she doesn't tamper with your daughters food again. "

Giving animal products to a child who is not used to them may make them feel really unwell. You supplied specific food for your daughter and the mother is an asshole for taking it upon herself to introduce other things to her diet."
3,abms7w,t2_1ddpm46a,toz-cec,NTA For talking to your mother-in-law about how she over stepped her boundaries. From my experience when I've dealt with Baby Boomers (assuming your mother-in-law is a baby boomer) they don't understand vegans. My grandparents think it's the craziest thing. My grandparents would've done the same thing. She probably gave your daughter non vegan food because to her vegan is the equivalent of believing in the Easter Bunny. But the issue here isn't vegan or not it's an attack on your motherhood. She needs to understand when it comes to your daughter it's your rules not matter what. 
3,abms7w,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"NTA. What she did was dishonest, and then she shamed you and basically called you a bad parent. Then dhe lied to your little girl and upset her. I'd never go over there again. Her opinions are irrelevant as long as your daughter is heathy and happy. Should your daughter want to change someday, that's a discussion for the 2 of you. Not his mother. You can't trust her. Next time she's shoving hotdogs down her throat, and nonmeat can make a nonmeat eater throw up. But talking to her is essentially useless. You already tried and she insulted you. Talk to your boyfriend and be careful in the future."
3,abms7w,t2_tpa21,Kosmicpoptart,"NTA in any way! It's pretty common knowledge that a child can be healthy on a vegan diet (and unhealthy on an omnivorus one at times.) I'd also be willing to bet that your mother in law would disobey your requests even if she were told your child had allergies/intolerances etc. Don't be afraid to stick up for your family, and good luck. "
3,abms7w,t2_1ttiu9kp,lydiafluff,"Absolutely NTA, and wow reading this made me super pissed. I've been a vegan my entire life, and am now a happy, healthy, well-adjusted, tall 19 y/o, so anyone who thought I needed meat to get some meat on my bones, or that I would be some underdeveloped shrimp (a concern of many uninformed people at the time, even though my dad had been healthily vegan for many years prior), was very wrong . Your BF's mother is a massive asshole, and she's totally wrong that your daughter needs meat (or non-vegan dessert, for some reason). I think you absolutely should bring this up with her again because if she did this right in front of you, she would absolutely do it behind your back, and vegans can get physically ill from eating meat and dairy if they haven't had it in a while. She also has NO right to violate your principles or interfere with the way you raise your child, so... she can fuck right off tbh. You did everything right here (packing separate vegan dessert is exactly what my parents did for me at parties as a kid, and I never had a problem with it), and she decided to be a hostile jerk for no reason. Also, I just want to say it's a good thing that you pointed out the mistake to your daughter without making a huge deal about it--that was the right thing to do. Some people just hate/do not understand vegans, but it's 2018. If someone is raising their kids in a well-informed and healthy manner, and the kid is happy, then it's no one else's business. Damn, I could rant for a while lol, but it's late so I'm gonna cut myself off and say you can feel free to PM me if you want more insight on this kind of thing, since I've experienced it from the other side <3 But basically, you're NTA, your BF's mother is, and you have absolutely every right to talk to her. Maybe you can even talk to your boyfriend about backing you up when you speak to her, since he seems like a very understanding and chill guy. Best of luck to you! "
3,abms7w,t2_2idjifbn,kabea26,"NTA. However, might I suggest a sort of “semi-veganism” approach? It’s going to be very difficult to raise your kid completely vegan. As soon as she goes to school she’s going to want to try all the foods her friends eat, and she’ll feel like she’s missing out if you don’t let her taste them. So it might be a good idea if you make vegan food at home but allow her to eat non-vegan food on play dates and at birthday parties. I get this idea from my own eating habits. I don’t like to eat meat, but I am not a vegetarian because I eat meat at other people’s houses and so forth when it would be impolite not to. "
3,abms7w,t2_1lhgt2vi,MehWhateverZeus,"NTA at all... Its your daughter she has no right to do anything like that. Tell her she can pull that shit with her own kids but she ever undermines your parenting then you don't care to see her. And if your boyfriend doesn't support your decision to parent your child your own way then you should really reconsider your wanting to be with him. And raising your daughter vegan is in no way wrong. As long as you give her the opportunity to decide for herself when she is old enough to make those types of decisions. My boyfriend was raised vegetarian but his parents gave him the option to try meat if he wanted once he got older, he chose to stay vegetarian. "
3,abms7w,t2_7861nye,poptart_divination,"NTA. As long as your kid is healthy, that woman has no right to impose her dietary beliefs on her or you. That having been said, I'd drop it and just make sure to not put yourself in a position where she has control over what your daughter eats. She probably thinks you're a nut case, so she's not only likely to not listen when you ask her not to feed your kid animal products, but also to keep trying to slip her stuff even if she seems to back down. "
3,abms7w,t2_2mxp0kx3,agatha-burnett,NTA. I would never be vegan or raise my child vegan. But...you sound reasonable and as long as that child is healthy you have every right to feed her the way you like. She was disrespectful and honestly i wouldn’t have let it slide when it happened.

3,abms7w,t2_2ew7kosq,2dpaperplanes,"NTA. You seem to be handling a child vegan diet very responsibly and if your kid and your pediatrician are all okay with it, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

She just doesn't like your lifestyle and is one of those people who wants to be an asshole about that. "
3,abms7w,t2_15vx9y,impressivepineapple,"NTA for this situation, but YTA for raising a child completely vegan. Hear me out - it’s not a bad thing to be vegan, and to teach your child those morals. However, even if you think you aren’t depriving your child of a choice to eat how they want later on in life, you are. Many times, people who are raised vegetarian and vegan have trouble digesting animal products when they get older since they weren’t exposed to them as kids at all. By not feeding your child any meat or dairy, you may be forcing them to be a vegan their whole life because of digestive issues. To make sure this doesn’t happen, maybe you can get small amounts of ethically raised meat/dairy from the farmer’s market to feed your child once a month, to make sure she doesn’t grow up intolerant to any foods she may choose to eat later. "
3,abms7w,t2_86iinu,LearnedButt,"NTA as to the specific question, i.e., confronting the mother. Her actions were not based on science, but merely as an affront to you. You may confront her over this without being an asshole. However, The science on vegan diets for children and infants is far from settled, with many legitimate studies pointing to possible harm. Conversely, we know that as an omnivorous species, eating meat as part of a balanced diet is not harmful. By erring on the side of possible harm over confirmed no harm, you are needlessly endangering your daughter. "
3,abms7w,t2_prlql,feluto,"NTA for being mad at your boyfriend's mom - what she did was really shady. However, YTA for forcing a vegan diet on your daughter.

3,b0pkn7,t2_336k4te8,follow-the-spiders-,"NTA it’s normal to have separate birthday events after a divorce. It’s nice to try and combine all the families for the first party after the separation so unless you just got divorced recently, his family doesn’t need to be at your house. Generally a divorce means that you and his father will no longer be part of the same family unit or doing special events together (weddings and the like excluded). If you did just divorce, it’s a bit more of a toss up but ultimately you should do what feels right for you and your son. I’m just concerned with the precedent it’ll set if you keep having your in-laws involved in his parties. My dad and his ex wife tried doing that with my sister and now we are coming up on her 15th birthday (5 years since the divorce) and she is demanding that my dad and his new girlfriend have a birthday dinner with her and her mother. They tried to say no, but because it’s been this way every year and she’s used to it, she got her way once again. However, 6 years old is quite young, so there are certainly allowances you should make for his happiness. Other commenters just seem hell-bent on this party being one of them, and I’m not convinced.

Depending on relationships with them, that can become completely awkward for everyone around. Even if you had a good relationship with them, you are no longer married to your ex. You are the parent, it’s a party you are throwing, as the adult you make the decisions on who comes to it, not your child.

The natural punishment for this is the fact that you now get to explain to your child why he will have two parties, instead of just having it happen naturally. Growing up with divorced parents there were a few events that they would get together for ""for the sake of the kids"" but honestly, those were kinda awful.

He doesn't understand why both sides can't come and clearly won't be spending any time with his dads side for his birthday as of now. That has to really suck for him, and he matters most.

Your son is a member of both families. If he wants both sides of the family at his party, you need to swallow your pride and step up for your son. He should always come first, especially in a matter of pride. My mother and father divorced quite bitterly when I was only a baby, but my mother still took me to meet some of my dad’s brothers and sisters (just about the only family he has) BY HERSELF without my father even present. I wanted to know my family and she complied. It didn’t matter whose time it was on. "
3,b0pkn7,t2_jidlw,Youre_ARealJerk,"NAH. I’m in a blended family and it is absolutely ok to not want to have your ex-family in your home or coming to a party you are planning/hosting/paying for. If you guys get along or you want to invite her, great! But if you don’t, that’s ok. You can explain to your son that grandma is going to celebrate with him next week when he’s with his dad. If your sons dad was dead, Or moved far away, or had lost custody, or something along those lines, it would make more sense for you to try to facilitate a relationship between your son and his grandparents. However, your ex is equally involved in your sons life since you have 50/50, so it is his responsibility to facilitate that relationship. You ex is entirely capable of throwing a birthday party for his son on his parenting time, and she can be a part of that. Some families do joint celebrations, some don’t. Whichever you are comfortable with is OK. The fact is that you are divorced. You aren’t one big happy family anymore so it’s Ok for your son to start realizing that celebrations and holidays will be separate. The important part is that you aren’t talking bad about ex-MIL to your son. If you told him “grandma is a jerk to momma and i don’t like her so she can’t come” that would make YTA, but it doesn’t sound like you’re doing that. So, NTA. Your ex and ex-MIL also are NTA though, I don’t think. Son probably brought it up and if it’s not a situation that’s ever arisen before, it’s uncharted territory for you all. They may have been unsure how to respond to your son and just said they’d come to make him happy. You should talk to your ex and just lay out some boundaries for what you’re comfortable with going forward. And I think ex needs to be the one to have the conversation with kiddo about how they’re going to celebrate separately. Edit: I know this isn’t a step parenting issue per se, but r/stepparents is a good sub and situations like this come up a lot. Those folks have a lot of good advice sometimes for dealing with these types of things. Also, your ex-mil May not be bad outside this issue, but r/justnomil also is REALLY a great place to get advice about setting boundaries and communicating/enforcing them. This post would be great for that sub if you’re looking for advice on how to broach the subject with ex-MIL or ex-husband. "
3,b0pkn7,t2_vlrj3c3,Witheer,"NTA, your time your decision, my cousins parents are divorced ex mother in law came over freaked out and cursed out my aunt and her bf. Some people are crazy I would say don’t take chances."
3,b0pkn7,t2_15f1hrtr,GoldenRose1999,"NTA. I grew up with divorced parents, and anytime my dad, my mom, and my stepmom were even in the vicinity of each other, you could cut the tension with a knife. My family on my dad's side talked mad shit about my mom and how much of a bicth she was in front of me and my two sisters. I was GREATFUL when we had to do things separately. I'm won't speak for anyone else, because sometimes parents split amicably and they wanted a better family dynamic, but for me, anytime I could keep my dad's side of the family from throwing a fit in a public place was something that I wanted to happen."
3,b0pkn7,t2_1rlqmeir,a1337sti,"YTA- &#x200B; think of this from your childs perspective, are these relatives in his life? if so then your a giant Asshole for taking out revenge in a way that negatively affects your kid. &#x200B; i feel very sorry for your son. &#x200B; I'm also in your shoes, i'm divorced with 3 kids i have them a bit more than 50% of the time. i wouldn't dream of denying family members on my Ex's side to attend. &#x200B; S.O.s sure tell them not to attend. actual blood relatives, no way. "
3,b0pkn7,t2_hqg4o,everlyafterhappy,"YTA It doesn't matter that it's during your custody. If it's your son's birthday then you should have worked with his father to provide an all inclusive party. A party at a neutral location that you and your ex pay 50/50 for. Edit: his grandma is kind of an asshole, too, for agreeing to come without talking to you and his dad. But that still could have been avoided if you did things right to begin with. "
3,b0pkn7,t2_3e9jq95q,BB_butterfingers,NTA and guarantee this kid won’t be sad that he gets another party. No kid is sad that they get two parties unless adults are being spiteful and one upping each other which nobody is doing here so it’s fine. They can have their own party and make this kids life. Or they could be apologetic and supportive towards you and maybe you can consider letting them be involved in your life. But that’s up to you and they aren’t entitled to your forgiveness because a person with some of their DNA ties you together.
3,b0pkn7,t2_hm3du19,Maze_face,"NTA Honestly I would've let them come to the party, that would be my passive aggressive attempt at making them see how well I'm doing and to feel guilty for abandoning me, my pettiness veiled in graciousness. But that's probably not healthy so I don't advise it. I was in a similar situation once and I couldn't believe how quickly ""family"" pretended I didn't exist. My spouse and I got back together and everything's working out, but my relationship with his family never recovered and is strictly superficial. "
3,a6uynt,t2_1tsdihf5,Cleverusername531,"NTA at all. But if you do go with her, it could be a helpful and supportive experience for her. As opposed to her being alone (either in the knowledge that her family knows but still maintains contact with him, or that her family doesn’t know and she’s got this huge burden). And of course it’s going to affect how you see him. Her answer sounds like someone who was groomed to think that if she told someone, she’d be at fault for breaking up the family or sending him to jail - when the truth is he is the one who broke up the family by molesting her even if no one else ever found out; and if he went to jail it’s because he committed a crime. "
3,a6uynt,t2_2nw6m2ad,FriendlyMum,"NTA but It sounds like she has a very complicated relationship with her dad. The abuse may have happened ages ago and a they built a strong (appropriate) relationship since then so it’s a long time ago. This DOES NOT of course make what he did any better but more explain the... layers upon layers of normalcy placed upon a horrendous thing that he did. Personally I think she wants to sus out the situation now. See how she feels around him... see what she wants to do (tell people, confront him, go no contact etc....). This could be a big step for her now she’s admitted the horrendous things that have happened. I think its important for you to go to support her in this process. Not as a defender for her but just to be there by her side as a safe harbour. You’d just have to have polite conversations. Can you do that? Id also suggest you have a safe word that she can use for you to exit a situation. Something you can throw casually into a conversation and the other person gets the out of the room asap as quickly as possible with no fuss. Eg code word tired.... she says... ‘i tired after that drive’, you jump on board ‘me too lets go have a nap’. We use tired cause we got twin babies and it’s like our status now to be tired but pick a word that slides into conversation for you."
3,a6uynt,t2_20qhbr6p,uwufuc,"NTA she still sees him as a ""father"" though and wants to ignore the disgusting piece of shit monster side of him... but at the end of the day I think you need to support her, there's also a high chance that she needs to stay in contact with him to not be isolated from the rest of her family"
3,a6uynt,t2_111o2n,IncredibleGonzo,"NAH, *but* if you want to have kids and plan on having them with her, I'd be *very* cautious given her desire to maintain a relationship with her father and seemingly kinda gloss over what he did. I mean, I get that it's complicated and confusing trying to resolve those conflicting sides of him, but depending on how her relationship with him progresses, it's possible she might end up having trouble accepting the danger of having potential future kids around him..."
3,b9w5ko,t2_35832jcz,Jasper_J_Jones,"YTA Why would a wedding be casual and laid back? Anyway, you knew that not to be true because the invitations always state the dress code. Sorry, but the safe country you're in, has done nothing bad to you, so there is no rational reason for you feeling this way. I don't blame your ex-friend for being curt with you. You are showing massive disrespect to the safe country who took you in, by suggesting their military men, who are getting married, and are enjoying themselves at a wedding would constitute harm to you. In no way, would a wedding constitute the reliving of traumatic experiences. This just screams 'snowflake', and it's annoying!"
3,b9w5ko,t2_77ip3,meiyoumayo,"NAH. You gotta look out for your mental health (and you definitely wouldn't have a good time at a party surrounded by stuff that made you feel upset and relive your childhood traumas), and she also has the right to hold whatever sort of wedding she wants. I think she could have been a little more understanding and kinder to you after you told her you wouldn't attend; how aware is she of your past? If she doesn't know what those experiences were, she might be assuming that you have a political motivation (which you don't), and that might upset her given her family's connection to the military, or if she knows, she might feel defensive because her relatives may have been involved in the conflict you escaped (I hope that isn't the case) and this is a very uncomfortable thing to confront, or they weren't (WWII, though I don't know how old you are) and she might think that you're ""blaming"" them for the conflict you escaped, even though you clearly aren't; trauma doesn't scan the person's uniform and go ""oh, that dude served in Normandy, not X Country, all good now, don't freak out"". "
3,b9w5ko,t2_awff2,CatherineConstance,"YTA, honestly this is pretty ridiculous. You aren't obligated to go to any events that you don't want to, but it's extremely weird that you would expect the invitations to make it clear that people will be in uniform, and again while it's your decision, YTA and I wouldn't want to be your friend after this either. Also being in uniform has nothing to do with whether a wedding is casual, most people in the military will wear their uniforms to events like that regardless of if it's casual or not. If you experience PTSD from something as simple and commonplace as people in the military attire of their country you need to get treatment for that ASAP because that is not normal and while your mental health is your business, you WILL lose friends over that because most people have at least some degree of respect for their nation's armed forces. To me this really just sounds dramatic and selfish, and I'll reiterate again that it's your choice and you aren't obligated to do anything, but if you can't put aside your personal biases for a friend, especially for something as important as their wedding, I wouldn't want to be friends with you. Edit: Before people say I don't understand PTSD - I do, and I suffer from it. But I get help for it very regularly and am on medication for this exact reason: I don't want to look like a whiny, sensitive child and lose my friends because I can't put aside MY personal experiences and trauma for something as important to my friends as their weddings."
3,b9w5ko,t2_fro2a,grog189,"NAH with a little bit of YTA - It is your choice to not go due to you being ""very uncomfortable"", and have every right to not go for whatever reason long as you are not being petty about it. But you are also being a bit of an asshole honestly due to the fact that like you said you are a refugee and it seems you don't care for the military that keeps the country that you took you in and gave you refuge. It's kind of like slap to the face for any family that has military members in it. If you can't suck it up for a few hours and support your friend just because you will see people in a uniform that keeps the country you are in safe then I don't know how much of a friend you are to her. &#x200B; Now if you truly were witness to some horrible things then yes ptsd is very real and you should try to expliain to her a bit more in depth as to why it bothers you and ask if there will be an after party or something in more casual clothing that you can still attend to support her. "
3,b9w5ko,t2_3i83go0y,JimLouHen,NAH I would be sure to send a nice gift with a note reiterating how sad you are that you can’t attend. Be sure to try to have a conversation with her and explain the panic attack you had at the parade and how you wouldn’t want to do anything to distract from her wedding in addition to protecting your own mental health. If she remains angry with you after that then she’s the asshole. And who needs a friend that can’t have compassion for what you’ve gone through.
3,b9w5ko,t2_mv5xy,CarnivorousCandy,"NAH. Potentially, NTA depending on Bride's next move. The PTSD isn't your fault and it's a really good thing that you find out about the attire before you arrived for the wedding. To ensure there's no hurt feelings, I might recommend sitting down with Bride to spell out for her what's going on. Make it clear to her that you saw/experienced some terrible things that have never left you that involve military (no need for details unless you want to share this with her). Make it clear that you're not declining because you just don't like the military or because uniforms make you mildly uncomfortable. She needs to know that this rooted in trauma, not something you can just power through for her. Let her know that you're still happy for her and support her. If you give her that info and she's still sour, then she's the a-hole. "
3,a5fjgh,t2_2not37vn,ThisBadgerBeeps,"NTA you're doing what is best for you and your family for three reasons. 1. If it's a trigger for you and you relapse, that's going to suck ass for you, and especially for your husband and baby. She could also trigger a relapse in your husband. You got to do what ever you gotta do to keep sober. 2. She could possibly hurt the baby while high. People do crazy shit while they're high. Maybe not intentionally, but the outcome is the same. At the very least your kid will see what ""being high"" looks like - that's not something you want to habituate your child to. You and your husband have addiction issues, you may have passed on the biological component to your daughter; you can't control the nature, but you can control the nurture. Don't expose her to any of it. 3. Having a drug user or drugs around a child could potentially lead to legal and custodial issues for you. If she brings drugs in your house, shit could go down, and next thing you know CPS is there. Maybe unlikely, but you've got to watch out for you and your family. You've done so much to lead a beautiful life with a beautiful family, don't let this person interfere with any of it. You owe her nothing and it's not your job to use your baby to get her sober... That shit has to come from her desire to get there. "
3,b0fofq,t2_nkpid,ejmears,"NTA - Ladders are no joke. Where I live improper ladder use is a huge issue. Someone died last year balancing on the top of a step ladder and over reaching painting a house not far from mine. I worked as an electrician for a long time, had a supervisor like John at one employer. Long story short after clashing over safety and paperwork protocol for months he went up the ""non rung"" side of a twelve foot step to adjust something while I was on the last legal step (10' up). I literally told him he's an accident waiting to happen, walked down the ladder, off the site and drove to the shop to quit. I had a new job within 48 hours and heard he got fired about 6 months later after almost getting the company sued. Don't get sucked into John's mess. Keep training Mike with integrity mm "
3,aiv1ng,t2_16rdjzx8,ReddiStediGo,"Nta but you will not show up positive lmao if been in a hotboxed room before a drug test and didn’t show up positive, basically if you don’t feel the effects you won’t show positive, you are more likely to show positive from eating poppy seed bagels "
3,b9fnag,t2_1z9hoc7h,gingeralidocious,"ESH - you guys need to have a conversation about how to split costs equitably rather than ""equally."" If you truly believe the heating costs are higher due to her, tell her that and ask her what approach she'd like to take? You could agree on a temperature that you can both live with and keep the apartment at that temp (this would allow you to split the bill down the middle), or you can take a look at who's ""spending"" more on temperature regulation and develop a formula for what percentage she should pay. Either way--have a conversation, don't issue edicts to your roommate. "
3,b9fnag,t2_r9re08m,Praise3The3Sun3,"NTA. I had a roommate who was notorious for this. We are up in kenosha wisconsin where it can get really really cold during the winter and even if you have good insulation you are still going to pay a heap of money for heating. Well one evening i'm walking down the main hallway when he walks out in boxers looks at me, mutters it's way too cold in here, and then turns up the heat. I just stand there not believing what I just saw. Like no shit sherlock of course it's going to be cold if you are not wearing anything. The solution we came to was that we knew roughly how much heating cost per month in winter at a stable recommended temperature. If he wanted to raise the temperature he would have to pay his half of the initial amount plus any extra amount the bill came out to over the predescribed average. He wants more heat. He pays for more heat."
3,b9fnag,t2_2x9xtewz,JoshDunkley,"nta. this drives me nuts at work. i HAVE to wear pants, socks dress shoes and collared shirt. im sweating my ass off cause the lady nearby is in sandles, short skirt and light blouse and turned up the heat. i cant take off anything else else without a trip to hr, but she could use a sweater and some socks. heh... sorry... somewhat related but clearly a tangent rant"
3,b9fnag,t2_2tm2gxjx,Ann-von-Beaverhausen,"NTA. Your roommate is absurd and/or has more money than brains. If you were shaming her for showing her body then yah, bad on you, but suggesting rather than paying to heat the place she should put on a pair of pants and a sweater may be cranky-dad territory, but cranky-dads can give really good advice. &#x200B; Good grief. "
3,b9fnag,t2_gyp00,CardinalHaias,"NTA, but you can handle that with more diplomacy. Don't tell her to wear more and not expect her fighting back. Talk about the cost of heating and how each ° saves x$ monthly yaddayadda and then suggest that a warm blanket, comfortable long sleeved stuff whatever keeps your warm enough. Or offer to buy a hot water bottle for her in exchange. :-)"
3,a9ba3b,t2_2rm1vndi,platinumsketch,"NTA I have family that's in a similar condition. We just don't go near them. They already hate us do to part of the family only being half related to me, and my (step? IDK the terminology) grandmother spreading lies about my mother and father and ignoring us as a whole. Meanwhile my mother's sisters still expect us to come over during holidays to visit them, but won't visit us on their own. I feel the pain amigo."
3,a7j6ae,t2_15xjp2,Annie_Benlen,"NTA for being mad, but perhaps some understanding and forgiveness might be in order. Your aunt made an asshole move. One. Unless this is a regular pattern then a lifetime of punishment seems kinds of assholey too. She said some unkind things, not stabbed your mother in the neck. Also, your formating it a bit wonk. You get the quote box format when you hit the space key 3 or so times as the start of a new line. Looks weird, and I do it myself fequently because I was taught to type on an actual typewriter and hit space 5 times to start a paragraph. But Reddit doesn't like that much. "
3,ajxfsq,t2_1m0abdfm,LivingAtAltitude,"NTA I understand what you're going through. Please seek help for yourself. When your tormentor is in your family and the abuse is secret it overshadows all family relationships. That secret will destroy you if you don't get help. If you're feeling bad about grandma you can just bring her lunch one day, tell her that you didn't mean to hurt her feelings but you were going through a difficult time and leave it at that. It may help to pick and choose which family members to visit and doing those visits one one one. You may want to stay clear of family gatherings, they're too tough."
3,ajxfsq,t2_13iqqs9a,BurningBerns,"NTA but, you refuse to tell anyone and lash out at them when they have no idea whats wrong and perceive you being disrespectful. You need to get some perspective on what it looks like from the outside looking in and you should probably get some counselling EDIT: due to some deeper thought about this ill be changing to NTA because its not your fault you have this mental state. But seriously if you wont tell your family, get some counselling because you seem to not be able to function normally in a social situation because of your trauma."
3,ajxfsq,t2_2w2icyyo,nigwardxcuntbob,YTA as sorry for you as I am I think that you should explain yourself in some way whether that be by saying you don’t like physical contact or that you don’t like people coming into your personal space or if you are comfortable doing it just outright explaining what happened. You may be surprised and people will may just believe you but by doing nothing to make this known to people you are being exactly what they think you are.
3,abyryw,t2_1lvc81je,P_Flange,"NTA. Being a couple doesn't mean you have to (or should) do everything together. If he can't let loose and be unfiltered when she's there, then it's probably for the best that she isn't there at these things. It's once every six months, surely she can entertain herself. Alternatively, she could make an effort to join in without having it cater specifically to her. "
3,ad2su6,t2_fhzg5,C9316,"NTA. You were purposely not informed or invited to the party. If Ally had enough foresight to plan this party with the assumption that all their old friends would likely also want their SOs to attend you were clearly snubbed. Also if your girlfriend, after seeing how arraignments for made for her friend's boyfriend after the fact, didn't raise hell to get space for you she clearly doesn't value the relationship as much as you do. "
3,ad2su6,t2_1lvc81je,P_Flange,"NTA. I was initially leaning towards NAH, until you said that everyone else's SOs had been invited and they actually made space for a latecomer. I could have understood them wanting a catch-up with old friends, but even if that were the case Ally (if she had any sense whatsoever) should probably have found a way to contact you on the sly to make sure you didn't already have something planned. She ""forgot"" about you? Horseshit. You were snubbed by both Ally and your girlfriend. Then the sheer audacity of her telling you that Ally would be joining you for cake after you were treated like that? I'd be taking a very, very hard look at this relationship because this is incredibly disrespectful of you as well as your relationship."
3,ad2su6,t2_yg8kz,danimals3,"NTA obviously, for reasons well cited here. I’d also like to throw in that I’d be pretty annoyed at GF as well for not asserting herself more in that situation. I know it’s weird to suddenly be at a dinner you didn’t plan, but as soon as I saw other men there I’d be like “hold on I’m calling Steve. I’m surprised he didn’t know about this. We’re going to need another chair please.” Like this should have happened IMMEDIATELY. That she felt powerless (or simply didn’t want to) say anything is profoundly unattractive and I have a feeling that when you do hash this thing out, she’s going to get super defensive and harp on about how it “wasn’t her party to invite you to.” That is going to be very frustrating for you. Hopefully she understands that how she handles this going forward is going to be a VERY big deal."
3,ad2su6,t2_npcu11l,mathxjunkii,"NTA- if one of my friends did this I’d basically tell them sorry, no, I have birthday plans I can’t come to the dinner. You should have spoken to me first. But also, upon getting there and finding out you’re not invited? I would have left. Immediately. No way am I letting my sweet amazing boyfriend sit at home and do nothing when he’d plan to make dinner for the two of us, while I’m out with a bunch of friends and he’s “not allowed” to join. Fuck that, fuck her. You can’t have a surprise event *for someone*, and not invite the people closest to that someone. I would even argue that your girlfriends siblings and parents should have gotten an invite too. If this was just meant to be an exclusive friends thing, it needed to be the next day. Not the day of. Edit: wait, dude, you ate her cake? My boyfriend never would have done that to me....... if you act that way often, I understand her apprehension in trying to get you invited at the last minute. "
3,ad2su6,t2_364glt,Nuova_Hexe,"NTA - You're rightfully annoyed, it does seem like you were purposefully excluded and hopefully your girlfriend will see that if you explain your reasoning. That's not to say Ally or your girlfriend are assholes, it's certainly a faux pas to not invite you but invite everyone else's significant others, but she might've meant no disrespect and is merely socially awkward. Make her another cake, apologize for bailing, and explain your feelings on the matter."
3,ad2su6,t2_283x19sf,newphone_whodis1104,"NTA. If I was in your girls spot... I'm asking about my wife right away... why she wasn't there, was she invited... and if I got a bullshit answer im out. No body is going to snub my best friend and think it's cool. I'd be salty balls if I were you. You made plans before she knew... and she's the main event, she should have spoke up right away knowing she was going to have to cancel on you"
3,ad2su6,t2_152pca1,forkinjanet,"NTA and I'm surprised your girlfriend isn't upset about it. If my friend organized a surprise birthday dinner for me and didn't invite my partner of 1.5 years I'd be upset with her. If it was an oversight and the friend didn't know them well I'd call them up and ask them to come because I'd want them there to enjoy my birthday with me and hang out with my friends. That said, if this is a good relationship otherwise and she's apologetic and it was all just a big miscommunication I would just make her a new cake and let it go. It's possible Ally didn't invite you because she doesn't know you well and then your girlfriend felt uncomfortable imposing on something that someone else arranged which is why she didn't have you come after. You can voice your disappointment, ask that it not happen again and move on from this if there's not a bigger reason she didn't have you come. "
3,ad2su6,t2_10khah7k,popskiller20,NTA. I don’t know if this has been said before. I see a lot of people defending OPs GF saying she couldn’t have done anything cause she was surprised with dinner. I understand that part. The part that is mind blowing to me is that she clearly had plans with you and immediately blew them off to go be with her friends. I hope and am 99% sure that if my wife (and even before when we were just dating) were in this situation she would tell her friend that she had previous plans and wouldn’t leave me sitting at home. I’m sorry OP but this relationship is one-sided. In retrospect are there any other times where something similar to this has happened with your GF? 
3,ad2su6,t2_2sj8cik2,TheRealPudd,"NTA In my opinion that's massively disrespectful. Ally and your SO are in the wrong here. Ok it was her birthday and it was a surprise but regardless she should have tried getting you involved, considering she would have known that you would want to be there for her birthday and other people's partners were invited. And the fact that there is no way she could think you wouldn't want to make plans for her birthday. Possibly Ally doesn't like you for whatever reason? I can't imagine why someone's best friend wouldn't consider the fact they have an SO that should be involved as well. Especially when their FIANCE is going. Anyway, I digress. Plus the fucking audacity to say she's going to bring Ally over the day after to share the cake YOU BAKED with you? I'd have blown a fucking gasket mate. The level of piss taking in that is just unreal. Sounds like she isn't as invested into the relationship as you and if that was me I would seriously think about what this means for the future. Or maybe she just hasn't reached where you are yet, but I would seriously let her know that something like that will not happen again if she wants you guys to continue. You're only as respected as much as you respect yourself. Let her get away with this and stuff like that will happen again and again."
3,ad2su6,t2_1cq9v8hh,SeraphofFlame,"NTA. I thought it was just a little misunderstanding and just a friend group party until you mentioned that a bunch of them brought partners, that's not cool that they didn't let you join"
3,ad2su6,t2_9zqnk,mideon2000,"I was yta at first because of ""get together of their old girl friends group from school."". Girl time, why would you want to hang out? But totally nta when i saw it was a couples thing. Totally not cool of ally"
3,ad2su6,t2_ayjy8gn,eofree2be,NTA - Sorry man. Sounds like you have other issues. Here’s how the talk is going to go she’s going to ask all the reasons you feel the way you did and she’s going to give you all the reasons why she didn’t do anything wrong. Fuck Ally and I would unfortunately give a lot of thought to being with this girl long term. There’s a level of decent respect that your GF should afford and Ally too. But she’s one of these girls who would think even if you were married to this girl that she holds more weight than you. Fuck that. I’m leaning towards you enjoying the single life. 
3,ad2su6,t2_cwd7s,WhapXI,"So, NTA. I can understand how you feel and would feel exactly the same in a similar situation. Feeling left out of the lives of the people who are most important to us sucks ass. There's nothing lonlier than knowing that everyone you love is having a great time without a thought of you crossing their minds. That said, I counsel restraint. Ignorance doesn't equal malice, even if it hurts the same. I've never had a surprise party thrown for me, but my instinct wouldn't be to see if I, the party recepient, could start inviting people along right there and then. It could be that your gf didn't feel ""able"" to invite you, owing to social convention and whatnot. The fact that others came along isn't your gf's fault. It doesn't mean that you're unloved or unwanted. If you were, she would be leaving you. By the sounds of it, this was more of a friendly gathering. Not specifically a girls group gathering as was likely expected, but friendly nonetheless. It's entirely possible your gf was hoping to celebrate her birthday with you privately. It's perfectly fine to want to keep different social circles seperate. I have clear boundaries between housemates, workmates, and childhood friends from my hometown. If I was having meetups with people from either of the latter two categories, I likely wouldn't bring my gf. YTA if you let this become something it isn't. Be a great bf. Show your gf what she was missing. Reasonably speaking, you can't make demands of people's time. "
3,ad2su6,t2_9n8ju,GingerZarah,"NTA though I will say you need to remember your girlfriend didn't know you were also trying to surprise her. To her she showed up to a surprise party and canceled and fun but not special night in with you. I think Allie made a mistake by not inviting you, but that wasn't your gf. Talk to your gf first but remember that only you feel the disappointment of her missing her surprise. If this is a part of a bigger trend of her ditching you then the situation changes."
3,ad2su6,t2_zw413,Checkmqte,"YTA Some people have been saying that your girl friend didn't seem to want you there, but I disagree. It sounded like she was having a great time, and didn't want to inconvenience Ally by asking if she could pull up another chair. This group of friend was one she hadn't seen in a while, and it sounded like she just wanted to catch up with them and have a good time with some old friends she doesn't get to meet very often. You totally overreacted.

You're comfortable with the idea of a larger mixed gender group, but struggling with the idea of her hanging all mint with just one or two guys without you. Just share your feelings - don't say this is something she can't do. Wait to see how she responds. It's very possible there were more people there. It's possible the others left earlier and she was still just having fun hanging out with a couple friends and didn't realize it would bother you. She might be open to setting some compromise boundaries that let her have fun but lane you feeling more comfortable. Or she might not, at which point you make some hard decisions.

For some it can really cut to the core. I've had this happen with me with my own family. My brother and his wife make passive-aggressive comments about my salary all the time. We all have the same amount of education, but I went into private business where as they went into the public school system. I have more risk and the rewards are better, but they have better benefits and a guaranteed job as long as they don't screw up. But they're still a little resentful that my first year of profits was better than their combined income. I've learned that I can give all the details about my job to people that I want, but it's still best if I don't tell them how much I'm able to pay myself. In the end I think all your friend was really looking for was what type of work you were going to be doing. She probably wanted to be happy that you landed a career. When you brought up the wage gap between you two then that made her feel like it wasn't fair that you were making more. It's not your fault at all and she's being childish, but feelings and emotional reactions are not always rational. Just be honest that you didn't want to be holding back information and that you didn't mean to offend her. If she can't handle that then that's on her.

I need some INFO, my question to you is what was she caught doing? Was it drugs? Was it being around shady people? My mom often dated abusive men or was around bad people, and this was my dad’s biggest concern. If it’s drugs, keep an eye on her for some time. Let her know that you are more comfortable having your shared daughter visit only if she’s sober. If the issue is shady people/bad area/stuff like that, suggest your daughter and your ex spend the day at the mall, park, etc. Either way, I’m going to say NTA. You’re concerned about your daughters safety it seems, and that’s 100% understandable. How old is your daughter? Personally when I learned what my mom did, I no longer wanted her in my life.

3,aqh7w1,t2_994jo,thiscouldbemassive,"NTA. Hang in there. My oldest was diagnosed with autism at 4. During his toddler years he was the tantrum king, having hour long tantrums as many as 8 times a day. He had six pack abs from all his fussing. And he had no language skills to express himself. It was very, very hard. What helped immensely was a combination of taking parenting classes through the local hospital, to learn how I can cope with his behavior, and getting him into Early Intervention. I'm in the US and so Early Intervention was free and he smoothly transitioned into Special Ed as soon as he was school aged. Thankfully, as my son has grown, he learned to speak, and was able to mainstream and get a normal education. While he is obviously not neurotypical, he still has turned into a kind and functioning adult. He's now in college learning how to code and I expect he'll have a good career. I hope your child turns out similarly. Stay strong. Be patient."

He can talk and communicate but mostly though repeated phrases. He's 17 now and my mum has put him in respite care as he's a 6'2 boy and if he has a fit he's very hard to deal with, I don't blame her. I mostly avoided the worst of it because I am older but my other sibling, I feel, didn't get as much attention as he deserves.

Med-student here, and because I'm a student I don't hold all the answers in the world, what I can tell you is that, as far as I know and according to a lot of the physicians I have learned from, there's not enough information to definitely correlate autism with a particular factor. What I mean is, there's not enough information to say that if you choose to have a second child, it would have autism as well, autism has not been confirmed to be genetic, environmental or infectious, etc. I would understand not wanting to have a second child because you feel you already have your hands full, or that you wouldn't be able to give him/her the same care, that's completely understandable and that would be a good way to approach your wife on the subject; but I repeat, just because your firstborn is autistic, it doesn't mean your second child will I hope you and your wife find some common ground on the situation, best of luck! :)"

I get your reasoning and understand that many higher-functioning autistic people don't agree and that's why I provided the argument I did. But also... I've lived my life with severe anxiety and depression and don't want to pass that on, which is why I never want to have biological kids (I may someday adopt). It's not a bad thing to want to spare your future kids suffering. "

It sounds like your son is on the more severe side of the spectrum, and as such will require extensive therapies to get him to a point of coping with real life and maybe make things a little easier on you. To give you some perspective on that: my daughter is mild/moderate on the spectrum and has to have speech and occupational therapy at school as well as applied behavior therapy 6 days a week at home. That takes a lot of our families bandwidth time wise, and her sister who is 2 years older has a hard time understanding why that is. We do our best to have special mommy/daughter or daddy/daughter days with just her so she knows she is special too, but it is still VERY hard. &#x200B; Bringing a baby into this situation is going to take away from your son with autism, who needs so much more help. Likewise, having a child with autism will take away from the new baby. And this is all regardless of whether or not the 2nd child ends up being neurotypical (NT) or not. I understand your wife's perspective in that she maybe feels robbed of having the NT child experience, but it would put immense strain on your family and marriage to have to split your focus. Your heart is in the right place, but best of luck to you. If she wants a 2nd child, that will always be hanging over head and heart if never happens. "
3,aqh7w1,t2_igx3m,MeowMyOvaries,"I'm a high functioning autismo. Aspergers. I'm a 24f. I also have a slew of mental illness i suffer from. I have depression and severe anxiety, being in an area with a lot of people or noises overwhelms me and aggravated my anxiety too. I get overwhelmed frequently. I get stressed out because of it. I throw up because of it. I frequently get panic attacks and need to desensitize myself to function, my autism and anxiety work hand in hand and it's debilitating. I don't understand body language and don't pick up on it. I don't get social cues. I've tried and failed, and try again. It's like watching everyone do a dance, trying to copy a dance i don't know the moves to. You're always off beat. I know what I'm supposed to do, but i don't KNOW it. It hurts, to try your best and be likeable but for people to turn their noses up at you. To not know why. I have been bullied, beaten, and sexually assaulted because of my autism. Yes. Because of it. These things made the first 12years of my life hard, and relearning how to world and people worked after those things occurred took another 12 years and therapy. So much therapy. I have been fired because people don't know what aspergers is. (Yes, i tried to pursue legal action but it didn't pan out) My mom tells me not to let anyone know i have autism, to hide it. That it would be easier for me if i just did my best to hide it. I hate feeling like i am ostracized for something i have no control over. I've had kids be told by their parents to ignore me, A woman called me a ""school shooter"", because the kid who shot up sandy hook had aspergers. I've had other kids call me a retard to their parents and they just ignore it. Those kids threw rocks at me, pushed me, hit me, stole from me. I had friends leave me and boyfriends dump me because they didn't want to deal with me anymore. Because i was too weird. Too ""eccentric"". Dating was the worst. I knew what men wanted,and what they were after, after the assault. That was the hardest to relearn. The strain on my parents as i grew and they learned how to handle my behavior strained my family.my sisters hated me and didn't understand why i was like this. I've also learned so many valuable things. Like how many good people are out there. How many of us have experienced things and grown as people from them. How life isn't black and white, like so many like me tend to feel. I've met some of the kindest, funniest people and value their friendship, for they accept me as i am and love my weirdness. I found a man, a wonderful man. He loves me for me and works with me and my autism. My family and i have grown stronger now that I'm grown, and can communicate better. I value my parents and want to do well by them. I'm able to identify my weakness and strengths and focusing on finishing school to find a career that values my work and not who i am as a person. But i still wish i was normal. I still stare at my bedroom ceiling, my wonderful caring boyfriend sleeping beside me, wishing i never existed. How my world would have been better if i was normal. How i wish i could restart my life over. Life has so many beautiful colors in it, but it doesn't take away from what's happened. My dad has aspergers. My children may have it if i have children. And knowing after all I've gone through, that it may happen to my sons or daughters....i had to suffer. I don't want them to. To worry about what happens at school, what my kids may tell me... Not everyone has these same life experiences. But my autism put me in a disadvantage for my life. I'm lucky to be growing up and existing in a time where people can help me. You're not an asshole for wanting your children to have the most out of life. But as someone with autism, i don't want children with autism. There is a lot to handle and i think a parent who can make that decision and realization is a good one. There's nothing wrong with wanting the most for your child's quality of life"

He has the energy of 20 kids, and tends to ""explore"" a lot (just this summer, went out the front door with no one noticing, and was found barefoot, almost 20 minutes away from home, near a large body of water, and a functioning Dam). My brother and SIL literally watch him in shifts 24/7 now when he is at home, and he has a ""buddy"" TA at school, for the same reason. He will never have a normal life, he will always be in need of constant care. As a parent, you want the best for your child, even if it means self sacrifice.

I couldn't live with myself knowing that I had brought someone else into this world only to suffer as I have.

He's 5, nonverbal, isn't potty trained, can't really communicate except to grunt and scream--constantly, shows very little interest/awareness in things around him, he's a loving little dude, but it's so heartbreaking and frustrating. And I worry about his future and his parents aren't well off and I'm guessing he'll never be self sufficient. And it must be so frustrating for him as well to not be able to communicate with us. Or to communicate in his way and not understand why we don't understand him. Obviously he's loved, but it presents so many challenges. It's not a path I'd wish for anyone so I get Where you're coming from. That said, both these kids have siblings who are ""normal"" for lack of a better word. So it's not a given that a future child will have autism. But personally I wouldn't want to risk it either.

When I was 8 my mother had a baby that was severely autistic, and due to personal and medical reasons, my mum just couldn't cut it - so I spent the rest of my childhood raising my babysister. She was told she would never walk or talk due to the severity, and she had low muscle tone to boot. It was rough and I'm not happy about it, but my sister is 19 now. She chats up a storm and moves around fine. I'm proud of what she has become. However, due to my Mother's negligence after I moved out, my sister hasn't gotten anywhere in life. When she was 10 she was answering grade 12 physics questions correctly. She was going to go to university and work for Nasa. But my mum let her down. It's definitely rewarding - autistic people have such HUGE promise, and such strong minds. You just need to be able to put the effort in - for life."

Also, even as a non-autistic person and someone who does generally enjoy physical affection, I'd be bothered by being kissed/touched on the neck by anyone other than a significant other, if that makes you feel any better.

It’s nice to be spoiled, but she is taking it to a whole new level and it’s not fair. Even if she is paying 20% more toward the household expenses, if she makes significantly more money, it’s still fair. Let her know what is bothering you, and why. I agree with the poster who said calling her spoiled is probably not the way to approach this, but it’s fair to say that you feel taken advantage of. Ask her if she knows how to set her alarm on her phone; you would be happy to show her how if need be. Same with the remote control. She can set an alarm on her phone to remind her to take her birth control, and maybe keep it in a location like her nightstand if she is in bed when she remembers to take it. You have a job and schoolwork to do. I’m sure you love doing little things for her when you can, but it sounds like she feels entitled to those things now.

3,b47s9v,t2_159q6p,CooellaDeville,"NTA but i disagree with some of the comments here saying shes intentionally manipulative. People are creatures of habit and often if people do things for us we get used to it. I suspect you're a nice guy and have a hard time asking for what you want or for help. Try to find your voice, ask her to do some small favors for you when you see an opportunity. If she asks you to grab the light when shes up and youre in bed just playfully say ""nah you were the last one up its your turn!"" Or something. Try to casually work her out of these habits until your situation improves. In the grand scheme of things this is a relativley small problem that ive seen a lot with really nice guys, but i believe it can be easily remedied. She also might still just be young and immature, not used to taking care of responsabilities herself. Help her grow out of it gently if you want to maintain the relationship long term. Continuing to enable her wont help. That doesnt mean dont do things for her, but ask for things in return and get her to pull her own weight."

That is, is it worth blowing up your relationship--since that is a possible outcome if you abscond with the dog in the middle of the night and dump him with the SPCA a couple of towns over. In this case? He bit your son. So I'd probably go one more round with your wife. I'd inform her that the dog bit your son, that I'm having none of it. I'm afraid the dog is a danger to our child. And I would explain why to me, this is the hill to die on--this is worth blowing up the relationship. (Edit to add:) In other words, make it clear what you are doing, why you are doing, how important it is to do it--and don't just wimp out and make the dog disappear in the middle of the night, since that will lead to less short-term anger, but a lot of long-term resentment."

It was painful as fuck and it still eats me up inside, but you have to protect your human children first. We'd tried training over the years, but the experts we consulted with agreed it wasn't traditional fear-aggression because the bites weren't always tied to an identifiable trigger and he didn't give a warning first (e.g. growling, ears back, etc.). Our vet helped us try so many different prescription regimens trying to help calm the storm in his head that caused him to lash out, but it wasn't enough to make him a safe family pet. We looked into every other alternative, but since he wasn't likely to ever be adoptable, and knowing his temperament, we eventually reached the painful conclusion that it would be less cruel to him to let him go surrounded by family than to abandon him in a cage, waiting on a very long wait list for a sanctuary spot that might not open in his natural lifetime. I hate that it had to be that way, and I delayed the decision as long as I could, but it wasn't fair to be playing Russian roulette with our son's safety. Your wife is fortunate that her dog is likely adoptable - many rescues do have trainers who can work with dogs who have a mild bite history on the Dunbar scale and rehabilitate them. But it will still be a painful choice for her to make, and that's where you need to approach it with a little more compassion. I understand that you're frustrated that she hasn't taken more responsibility to be proactive to protect your child, and that's absolutely justified, but if you don't acknowledge her grief (she's in the denial stage now), it'll put an unnecessary strain on your marriage on top of the existing conflict. NTA for holding firm on the position that dog needs to go, but YWBTA if you surrendered him against her will without even giving her a chance to say goodbye or propose alternatives, like direct rehoming to a friend without kids who can train the dog instead of shelter surrender. Good luck! https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/issues/5_4/features/If-Your-Dog-Bites-Someone_5444-1.html"
3,b1266d,t2_3dce6gzh,TriXieCatty,"NTA That dog has to go. Is the risk of having your child permanently scarred, mauled or dead worth keeping this dog? Hecks no! And I can’t begin to imagine why your wife shows more protective instincts for the dog than for her child. I survived an unprovoked attack from a dog just like this one when I was 2 - the scars (both physical and emotional) are permanent reminders of the attack and I am terrified of large dogs to this day. Protect your child and yourself. Your wife needs to analyze her priorities."
3,b1266d,t2_111o2n,IncredibleGonzo,"NTA. In a lot of cases I think poor child-pet interactions are down to the parents not teaching the child properly, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. It's understandable when an animal nips a kid for pulling on its tail, but biting for getting too close? Not OK. She didn't train the dog when she should have, she won't let you try to train the dog now... getting rid of someone's pet like that isn't *great* but you need to protect your kid and she hasn't really left you much by way of other options."
3,b1266d,t2_k50gj,donutshopsss,"&#x200B; NTA!!!! Note: I've spent 50+ hours training my dogs, have worked with 2 professional dog trainers and I have a pretty strong grasp on dog training / personalities as I work with big and powerful dogs with strong personalities. To put it simple: dogs are just like humans, sometimes they just don't like one specific person(s). My wonderful, amazing, kind and loving dog ""muzzle punched"" my toddler, a term used for when a dog bumps into you with his/her muzzle with the mouth closed. It's sort of a ""warning bite"". All my son did was walk up on him from behind and touch his back. That was a *clear* indication that the dog was saying he's not a fan of my son touching him - something I cannot guarantee my son will avoid doing. That was enough for me to get rid of the dog who was like a son to me and my wife. When I talked to my dog trainer he agreed that the muzzle punch was a clear indication that the dog was willing/able to bite the kid. If that muzzle punch hit my kid in the eye, it would have been enough to ruin his eyesight. Similarly, if that dog bit your son in the wrong spot it could cause serious and lasting damage... something you would forever regret. I adopted my dog to a wonderful couple that didn't have any kids as I refused to put him down. I would *highly* recommend that you get that dog out of your house ASAP. Your dog has already broken the ""warning"" barrier and I say with 100% confidence that your dog will have a *significantly* easier (i.e. justifiable) time doing it the second time, especially because he's not trained. When you train a dog, you need to make sure they understand their ""role"" in the house - i.e. they are not the dominant leader, *you* are. Based on your dogs actions, he believes he is the owner of the territory you're living in and he views your son as someone invading *his* space. Not good. Not safe. Not going to end well."
3,b1266d,t2_34lijbra,Randibug91,NTA but please rehome him to a family without kids. If you drop him at the shelter they will have to put down that he has bitten and then he won’t be adopted and might get moved to a kill shelter that will eventually euthanize him 
3,b1266d,t2_11ejf18w,puppetpauperpirate,"Why did you have children without training your dog first? You knew this dog was ornery and old and had a short temper, and instead of training it to possibly reduce those behaviors or eliminate them completely, you continued to ignore it, and instead and went and had a kid. You already knew beforehand that this dog was probably volatile around people it didn't know very well, it's not like you adopted this dog after the kid was born? YTA. I absolutely hate people like you, who treat their animals like garbage after they pop out a kid. You're a fucking piece of shit to be honest if you were to do that and take away her best friend no matter how grouchy he is, you could have tried multiple other avenues and outlets of training and behavioral therapists and socialization but you didn't.

Don't do it without saying anything to your wife though, she's going to be angry either way but it's either the dog or the kid's safety."
3,b1266d,t2_hqg4o,everlyafterhappy,"NTA Noe, you are kind of an asshole if you get rid of the dog, but it's understandable since your son is in danger and your wife is uncompromising and irresponsible. My suggestion is to tell her to do something about the dog or you will get the legal system involved. You are within your rights to just get rid of the dog, since marriage law makes it as much your dog as it is her dog. But it's going to piss her off, and if it leads to a divorce it's best to have a record to use against her."
3,b1266d,t2_26xpcwfe,little_honey_beee,"NTA. I love my dogs and was all ready to tell you to suck it up, but no, this dog isn't fit to be around children (or you, considering the growling thing on the couch). Taking him to the SPCA is almost certainly a death sentence, and I would never agree to that for either of my dogs, even if they got aggressive, but I would definitely find a suitable home for them. Which is what your wife should do. "
3,b1266d,t2_qliv4ps,GobbTheEverlasting,"NTA The second your dog bites your kid, that dog needs to go. End of story. When I was a little tyke (\~3-4) I was doing what kids do and being an idiot. I poked my dads doberman with a stick. She was attack trained, with sticks. So naturally she bit me on the chin. It left a pretty good scar that I have to this day. &#x200B; My dad LOVED that dog. Absolutely loved that dog. But the second she attacked me he knew it was over. He got rid of her the next day. Nothing should be more important to a parent than the safety of their child. Its by no means an easy thing to get rid of the dog and im sure your wife will be heartbroken, but what happens when your kid gets away from you again and the dog DOES break skin? What if he does more than a single bite? What if you don't get to your kid in time and the dog KILLS him? Its just not worth the risk. &#x200B; &#x200B;"

My first response was going to be this: Next time your parents charge you for rent, send them a bill for all the hours you put in babysitting. These are not your kids, and they’re not your responsibility. Your parents are hindering you from moving into your own independent life. You’re doing unpaid work for your parents, and they’re making you pay rent on top of it. If you put that work into a paid job and applied the 200 you currently pay in rent toward your own place, could you afford it? If so, do that. However, if you’re living in a really expensive market like London and moving out would be massively more expensive than what you’re paying in rent to your parents, than maybe you don’t have such a bad deal.

You need to start setting boundaries and keep them. If 1 is “irresponsible” at 23 years old it’s because they made him that way. 3 is old enough to get her license and they should invest some time into driving lessons for her rather than volunteering you to drive them. 3 and 4 should also start taking the bus home when mom and dad aren’t available to pick them up.

I would have a serious talk with them and tell them their reasoning is bullshit.

Then he complained that you weren't paying enough attention to him (a) after a ten-hour shift, (b) while doing the cleaning, and (c) while putting your child to bed.

This isn't a minor annoyance. It's exposed a fundamental flaw in the way your group handles harassment, and you guys need to have a discussion about what your code of conduct and formal disciplinary measures should look like so no one *has* to choose between getting to play or not dealing with unwanted touching."

You absolutely have the right to ask somebody to stop touching you, and if they continue to ignore your request, I do not think it's out of line to ""cause a scene"" over it. If his issues are impulse control related and the people around him know it, they are the assholes here. They knew that his behavior was becoming an issue and that he didn't necessarily have the capacity to control it. Assuming they did know him well enough to predict that, I think they were counting on you to basically bear the brunt of the situation and not make it a big deal. That is a shitty expectation and when you are in no way obligated to fulfill, in my opinion. I know there's a lot of assumptions there, but this is a pretty sensitive topic because I have an intellectually disabled cousin that my aunt and uncle do similar things with and to.

He got the job done. Hands wash. People do a lot of nasty shit on a daily basis and even earn their living doing it....he had to do nasty shit twice while acting fast during emergencies. In every case, those who do nasty shit on a daily basis to earn a living and your boyfriend's, hands wash. Once you get that last bit of poop from under your fingernail and your hands are clean as a whistle it's like it never happened. Nobody uses too much toilet paper. They arrive at the amount of toilet paper they use via trial and error. What women don't understand is that men have hairy, hairy assholes. Smear a spoon full of peanut butter in shag carpeting and see how much toilet paper it takes you to get it out. I bet it takes more than you think. No woman with their hairless ass should ever give men advice on how much toilet paper to use. You wrap it thick enough so your fingers aren't poking through via the pressure you have to apply, inadvertently fingering your own butthole, and keep wiping until it's clean. That's how men use toilet paper. Women with their hairless assholes don't understand this due to not having to apply pressure to get that peanut butter out of the shag carpeting. A lot of people in this thread over reacting like you did. It'd be hilarious to watch some of you people field dress a deer or even have to give an exam that requires you to stick your entire arm into a cow's rectum if you were a vet. Hands wash people.

I get home and start cleaning, because my twin sister and her husband are staying the night and we were going to have some fun (I obviously wasn't aware of the surprise party). I did yard work also, everything, quite the hustle (although my wife and I did shit during the week also). My twin sister shows up and we go to a local casino and gamble some. Then we head back home, and I open my garage door to a garage full of people, joke was on my twin though, because she thought it was a house warming party. I should have seen the signs that something was up, but I didn't (nor did my twin). The point of this story, how lazy can your husband be? I cleaned my house and prepped my yard for my own surprise party (it's good to have a clean house in my opinion). "

Did you look up tips on how to ease an adult cat into a new home? My cat was 2 years old when I got her and we kept her in a small room with her food and litter and gradually opened up the rest of the house to her. It took her over 24 hours to come out from under the bed and actually explore her surroundings. You just expected this cat to behave perfectly and gave him back after he kept you up for one night. I wouldn't feel too bad because you brought him back to his original owner who he obviously loved but I definitely think you could have explored other options and done some research on this before just giving up.

Ask of he minds maybe staying at his girlfriends house one or two nights a week. If she's staying there all the time is she contributing to the house or at least making food for you as well? "

Having constant company can make things get bitter quickly. OR she can pay to be a permanent resident, if that would make it more acceptable to you. If you haven’t agreed to her as a permanent roommate, you need to talk to your roommate about it. What you have now is not what you signed up for, and you’re feeling like a third wheel in your own place. Having boundaries is an important part of being an adult and preserving your own sanity. If he can’t respect your reasonable boundaries then he is not only a bad roommate, but a bad friend. The only way you’d be an asshole is if you would do the exact same once you got a girlfriend. IMO if someone is not paying rent, they shouldn’t be there more than half the week, if that even. It’s healthy to have separate/diverse social lives. "

Ok so this opinion is coming from my viewpoint as the sister in my situation that isn't wanted as the maid of honour (albiet my sister mentioned two maids of honour but I think that was just her trying to be nice). So your sister shouldn't have freaked out like that. She's probably hurting. I know I am. Like I said, I'm 99% positive my sister doesn't actually want me as maid of honour, though I think she is maybe ok with me being a normal bridesmaid. It is something to be said about allowing your sister to at least be a bridemaid. To counterpoint that though, at the end of the day, it is your wedding. Not hers. Not your moms. Yours. And at the end of the day, like you said, you're not even engaged or about to be at the moment. Things may change by the time that comes. I feel your family's reaction is a bit silly (I will not invalidate the hurt your sister probably feel though just as I will not invalidate your frustration and probably also hurt over this).

Maybe you do need to have more involvement in her finances - maybe you have control of her money and she gets an “allowance” as needed. I don’t know. I don’t think your terms are unreasonable at all.

3,b0pppg,t2_5gbjl,blackdragon8577,"ESH If I was assigning percentages, yours would be low, because it seems like your heart is in the right place. But you cannot force people to do things you want them to do like this by slipping in clauses in contracts. In fact, I don't think this could even be enforced. She is a grown woman. Best case scenario here is that she will take the money for the house, tell you that she won't give him the money, and then she will give him the money anyway, which is why I think she is partly in the wrong too. There is nothing you can do other than stop giving her money. But it sounds like she will give away everything to help him. And of course your brother is a giant asshole in this situation based on your description. One thing you might be able to do is to have her move in with you and have you take over her finances as power of attorney. You could route any monthly checks she gets into bank accounts owned by you and pay for all of her stuff. She may even warm up to this idea because then you would be the bad guy cutting off your brother, not her. And it sounds like you don't really have a problem playing the bad guy in this scenario. Plus, she is getting up there in age. Already having power of attorney and making sure you are the person making the decisions, and eventually being the executor of her will after she passes will make your life a whole lot less stressful in a legal sense. Maybe phrase it so that you are doing this so that she can just focus on her hobbies, friends, other leisure activities, etc. And you will take care of all the financial stuff for her. Then tell your brother to kiss off. Just a thought. However, I would strongly recommend getting all the legal stuff out of the way so that you are the one controlling things if she can't make medical or financial decisions or for when she passes so that there is no grey area in who is in charge of her and her stuff.

3,a37od2,t2_jlmcl6e,MoreIdeasFaster,"I think YTA as it currently stands, but you would be NTA if you established predetermined times when you'll be using the speakers. You can use headphones some of the time and then switch to the speakers when it's important to have the higher sound quality. If it's just, like, one hour at a time, and your roommate knows that ahead of time, he can know when not to nap. I don't think having to listen to someone else's bass is *that* big a deal, but it's super annoying when you don't know when it'll start or end."

It depends how often you do this kind of thing. If you're doing it every single day and he feels like there's not a single given time he could try to nap, the you are TA, but if it's once a week or so, I think he's being unreasonable. His right to his free time (napping) is not inherently more important than your right to your free time (recording). You seem like you took the necessary precautions of checking if this was okay before you even bought the speakers. &#x200B; I would honestly just try to avoid the problem and ask him for his class schedule so you know when you have a few free hours to produce. If you have a situation like your friend wants to come over and drink and jam, ask your roommate in advance if it's okay. I still think you're NTA but I also really understand desperately needing a nap and again, if you do this constantly, I can definitely see his frustration. &#x200B; Also, stop arguing with people in the comments.

What I find interesting in this sub today is that universally redditors had no problem recognizing a man’s dominion over his food and his preference to not have it violated, but when a woman was upset that her body was being violated by her husband there was a whole lotta “we need info,” “what exactly was the touching?” “you have to give him time to change his habits” “what if the touching isn’t as bad as the OP says?” "

I can't relax knowing that if I want my full portion of fries I have to keep up. Sometimes when I'm really in the mood for a particular food I'll know to order my own so I can relax. I was annoyed just reading the things your wife says to you after taking your food. Like, super annoying! I am curious about one thing. *I had ordered something I was looking forward too, something she had tried before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some.* You mentioned a few times about ordering for her.

My own husband, when we were dating, asked me not to do this as his last GF would order a salad for appearances and try to eat off his plate. He began ordering second plates and she got mad at him for being wasteful. Point was that she wanted to put him in his place and wasn't particularly interested in seeing him as a person with interests and preferences of his own. That was the dealbreaker. Let her have her tantrum. Just shrug and say that it's not up for debate anymore. You will order a second plate the moment her fork ventures over to your plate. Her objections are moot."

Thats just ridiculous. That said, NTA and no, you shouldn't have to ask. Because even if this isn't a recurring theme and isn't about control and manipulation, what she is doing is unreasonable. You have given her options, including spending more money just so she can enjoy her food, even if it may not be practical. She has built a habit of doing it and is selfishly prioritizing her enjoying the food without ""looking like a pig due to ordering multiple dishes"" over you having a good meal and enjoying yourself altogether during dinners out. Because while yes this is still speculation, she did get upset about it, meaning its a subconscious, or even conscious concern for her. Not justifying her in doing something you have repeatedly asked her not to do though. Insecure or not, she could compromise on her own expense if ""looking like a pig for eating too much"" really bothers her that much. You should only have to ask once, not every time.

If Sarah truly does not feel that way about you (you should have spoken to her before cutting off the friendship) then it's up to you whether her friendship is enough (if she'd even actually speak to you after this!)

He waits for permission to touch again and still asks if certain contact is okay. If this guy can't handle an easy act of respect such as not touching your lady bits when you ask him to stop, maybe he has a lot of growing up to do. Personally I wouldn't tolerate it.

He felt certain he would never choose to have kids and to me it made sense to take that off the table and make it less of a concern. Its been about 3 years now. Does he feel the same about never wanting kids? Honestly no. For the place he is at in his life a kid would be welcome. He is still okay with the choice he made (and I think that is important.) Having watched him change his mind...I honestly suggest you wait. You mention being afraid to have sex because you fear pregnancy, while I don't want to dismiss your fear the risk of pregnancy can be mitigated. Yes there are failure rates... but a vasectomy does too. (Not saying this to scare you further.) I would ask, do you have a life partner, someone you have non sexual intimacy with? If no, are you 100% sure that you would feel the same was about sex if you did? About having children with that partner? If you can say for certain that you will never want kids under every concievable idea 100%... go for it! Nothing wrong choosing to be childfree.

Either that or they won’t, but only at the expense of them calling you a total pussy behind your back for the rest of who knows what? Not worth. It’s toxic. It’s fucking toxic. No one who respects you, as your own fucking wife should, would give this type of shit the green light. The fact your BIL and your wife did means that neither of them really know you as a person or care enough to respect your boundaries. No one is this situation respects you. Accidentally breaking the headset shouldn’t even be a mentionable aspect compared to the trauma they have/could have put you through. “Oh, I was only pretending to rape you”. It’s disgusting. It’s fucking abhorrent. This is why people in porn never really get to leave it. Because they don’t know how normal humans function anymore.

Nip this shit at the bud, bro. They’re are plenty of people who will for one respect you regardless of whatever. Two, never compromise your feelings or security just for a shitty joke. People in porn never mature passed high school because their whole career is based off the same hormones that are flaring up around then They don’t have to grow up. They should, but they won’t.

Mainly because a VR is meant to make something look real and can be off putting for some. Imagine a VR serial killer that comes after you. It can be startling to say the least, so how you reacted isn't surprising. 3. If you have that bad experience in your past then your wife should have been more concerned about you than the VR. 4.

You absolutely shouldn't pay even one penny towards the broken equipment. This wasnt in any way your fault. The machine was your BIL's responsibility and since he doesnt own it and it's owned by his employer, he should've known better than to use it for a nasty practical joke. That was the risk he took by being careless and irresponsible and the responsibility to pay for the damages falls on him. Your wife and BIL owe you a huge apology for what they did to you (your wife especially since she had prior knowledge of the abuse). I dont know your situation obviously, but she comes across as being very uncaring and coldhearted. I'm sorry you're married to such a person.

I can't think of anything more uncomfortable than having my partner and a relative standing outside the door laughing as 1) I was surprised by porn and 2) I got unwillingly turned on by a porn scenario I wouldn't have chosen for myself. Especially that the scenario involved imaginary relatives (step daughter) while my real relatives were standing outside waiting for my reaction. While you're in VR you're vulnerable to the real outside world. I mean, they could've snuck up on you while you were in VR. (I know they *didn't* do this, but I can't stop thinking about how vulnerable you were, visibly physically turned on by something that mentally doesn't turn you on, and possibly being visibly turned on in front of your BIL. So many boundaries were crossed.) And this is all *before* your wife allowed a gross PTSD trigger into the VR. Your BIL was insanely irresponsible with the equipment. He should've told you before you even started using it that he didn't own it and that it was expensive, possibly irreplaceable, and delicate. He should've kept you in a carpeted area with no furniture or fixtures to suddenly trip on. Putting you in a bathroom with nothing but hard surfaces and no space to move was beyond stupid. And anyway you don't fucking scare people who are using breakable, expensive equipment. Is this your wife's brother? Because they sound like they're equally immature and inconsiderate. You were really brave to explain to them why you were triggered. I know you previously told your wife about the abuse, but standing there in the moment and being courageous enough to talk about it in the midst of your PTSD... wow. Here you are telling your BIL about it for the first time, in the worst circumstances. And their reaction was to be dismissive? They needed to be leading you to a chair to sit down, getting you a glass of water, rubbing circles on your back, and apologizing profusely. I am so angry at your wife right now. If you play a practical joke on someone you need to accept responsibility for the consequences. Your wife and BIL should be scrounging to pay for this mess, not you. They should be apologizing for putting you in that situation in the first place. Look, I know internet peeps jump to ""dump the asshole"" with next to no knowledge about someone's relationship, but I really want to tell you to dump the asshole. At least go to a couples counselor! Or get some books on recognizing and building healthy relationships. What she did and how she reacted is probably on one of those ""this relationship will fail"" prediction lists. At any rate, you deserve more. Really, even if the equipment cost $50k, your real problem here is your partner."

I don't think it's your responsibility to pay for it at all, but you could offer to chip in as a goodwill gesture if you're so inclined. *Definitely* don't pay for the whole thing though.

3,ag8qzp,t2_zjzp2,codyvanderfox,"SHP, seeking validation, you're obviously not an asshole for freaking out unexpectedly and accidentally breaking something. It's certainly unfortunate. I don't think your BIL meant to be callous by being more upset about over VR equipment (as opposed to your feelings) if he seriously thinks he could lose his livelihood. Anger is a common initial response to intense unpleasant stressors, like being triggered by molestation memories or having your livelihood threatened. I'll be generous and assume (dangerous to do, I know...) that your wife never suspected this would trigger you. They should both try to be more understanding of your strong response to a powerful stimulus. I'm sorry that this is a big mess that's straining your relationships.

I would offer partial or full repayment as a way to keep the peace, even though he's a huge dick for his reaction and you definitely are in the right.

3,ag8qzp,t2_k1le5,Rambo1stBlood,"YTA. Possibly SHP...This would be like using xhamster or pornhub and smashing your laptop because a naked guy or some gay porn popped up in an ad on the sidebar. You knew it was porn related when you put it on! If the human form traumatizes you, that is fine, but I wouldn't act like that is their fault or that you can just break whatever you want because of it. If anything being molested in the past might explain the reaction - but it definitely doesn't make you any less responsible for the VR system. You need to get help for that trauma, instead of breaking expensive electronics for triggering you.....and if you are going to forego that you need to be ready to pay for the tech you are smashing over it. Be an adult and pay for the VR system, and also realize that when browsing porn, on any device, you might see something for a second that isn't for your orientation. "
3,ao9swn,t2_p3j2k,powerlesshero111,"Honestly, NTA. Look, you've been through a lot. You were taken from your shitbag mom, and basically picked yourself out if the trash. You've dealt with the mental issues from it, and come out on top. It's hard as fuck to do that. Honestly, I don't know how old you are, nor does it really matter. You need to talk to your siblings as they call you, but honestly, tell them you that they will have to take it slow with you. You have a whole life, and you've built your life around not having siblings. Tell them you can just afford one phone call a month, and set a schedule for it, like Sundays at 3pm to 5pm. I won't lie, it's kind of an asshole move to just block them all out right (even though they sound annoying as fuck), but you spent the better part of your life not being an older sibling, and forcing you to just jump into being the big brother is a definite asshole move on them.

3,apc2b5,t2_1a0oyhbz,Momof3dragons2012,"NTA. I am sensitive about my weight too and would be upset if someone called me a pig, but I would be mortified if I ate someone else’s food and I would never do it again. In fact, I would replace what I ate. The fact that she kept doing it over and over is infuriating. She is probably one of those people who feel that can’t help themselves so why should they try? The entitlement is great with that one. She sounds like a Narc. I’d tell your brother that he created this situation by allowing his girlfriend to turn your kitchen into her personal trough, and give him a bill for replacing food and for a lock system. Tell him that if he wants to continue living there then he will have to pay to have locks installed on certain cupboards. I believe you can buy lock boxes for the fridge as well. Then lock up your food. I’d love to be a fly on the wall when she comes back and sees that she can’t help herself. I imagine there will be tons of histrionics. If you can’t lock up the fridge when spit in your food. And label it as such (leftover Thai. Do not eat, I have spit in this food, Miss Piggy do not eat). If she eats it anyway remind her that she ate your loogy and then give your brother a bill for the food she ate. I had a friend put cigarette butts in his food (he was a smoker and it didn’t bother him to pick them out). She sounds like a nightmare."
3,apc2b5,t2_i6jpu,Thundergreek,"NTA - Yeah what you did was a dick move, but having shared a place with roommates and all of us buying our own food, I know that the distinction is crucial. I get personal about my food, I pick what I want and I always know what I have left and if something were missing I'd be explosively furious. The fact that you only took it that far I think showed some restraint. &#x200B; I will say the majority of your anger should have been focused at your brother though. In the end, he's the roommate, he's on the lease and its HIS guest getting away with this shit. The more mature thing would be to have a one-on-one sit down with him and tell him that if his guests don't show you and your property the respect you deserve, he will be kicked out. "
3,apc2b5,t2_h7a0r,Pyrhhus,"NTA. Hell, you're pulling punches and being laid back compared to what my reaction in that scenario would be. I grew up poor enough to go to sleep for dinner entirely too often. Fuck with my food and I will call you far worse than ""Miss Piggy"". On a side note, tell your brother to stop dating a thief with no self-control. Who gives a shit about her weight, that's the real problem. Any longterm relationship with people like that will make life a lot harder than it needs to be"
3,apc2b5,t2_2ec51ac2,11nealp,"NTA, play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Your brother is the asshole too, he should have the respect that if she keeps eating your food he makes it clear it's not ok to her, and if not, she doesn't come over, full stop. Can he really imagine himself going on to live with such a disrespectful and thieving snowflake? People here saying ESH because your comments were mean but mean comments are a big step below stealing shit and you were out of options short of doing something that stresses your relationship with your brother. She totally had it coming. NTA"
3,apc2b5,t2_2hodg4x7,uselessflower13,"NTA You're losing money and time because of her. You have confronted her multiple times - you are being mean and disrespectful to her by calling her miss piggy and oinking at her, but, let's be real - isn't stealing other people's food and continuing to do it after being confronted multiple times mean and disrespectful too? She's and asshole, your brother's and asshole, you and your roommate are justified imo. Maybe tell him to move out or not let her come in your house? "
3,apc2b5,t2_5dhon,poeticdisaster,"NTA. Had a roommate whose boyfriend did this and neither of them would clean up after themselves. I got to the point where I just bought a minifridge and didn't use the kitchen at all anymore. Your brother is a pushover for letting her continue doing this. She's a bitch for directly ignoring repeated requests for her to NOT eat your food. Calling her Miss Piggy and oinking in her face is a bit wrong but if civil conversation doesn't get it across to her that she needs to quit, then I can see why you would be pushed to doing exactly that. I would also suggest telling your brother that she isn't allowed over until she learns how to respect other people's boundaries - including those involving their things. If this is what she does when you tell her not to do something, imagine what she's doing when she's in the house and the 2 of you are not. "
3,apc2b5,t2_uu8a7iv,Jb2head,"NTA, if people think calling her miss piggy is equivalent to her eating food that doesn’t belong to her or her boyfriend deliberately and thinking being cutesy and half assedly apologizing makes up for it, then she’s a huge asshole, and frankly so is your brother for not doing anything about it. If I were you, I would’ve done a lot worse. I would stock something up for her to eat that would give her the shits or make her throw up. If it continued I would constantly have something stocked up in the fridge to set her off until she learned her lesson."
3,apc2b5,t2_62k86,Jbliu,"NTA. The fact that she is fat is incidental to the fact that she is *stealing your food*, which is why she's a pig. If her weight makes her sensitive about being called a pig, she shouldn't steal your food and warrant being called a pig. She could be rail-thin, bulemic and purging your food after she steals it, and the best way to describe her behavior would still be ""piggish."" (Though at that point, perhaps the best tack would be to get her professional help.)"
3,apc2b5,t2_2thxbm61,Ashlipig22,"NTA I mean your comment to her was mean, but I’m quite a big girl too but if someone was like “hey that food was mine, please don’t eat it” and I didn’t know it was theirs I’d be like “oh I’m sorry” and offer to replace it and I wouldn’t eat their stuff anymore. I wouldn’t just keep eating their shit to the point where they had to hurt my feelings just to get me to stop eating their food."
3,apc2b5,t2_15haui,zzaannsebar,"ESH. &#x200B; I think you were a justified asshole. I maybe wouldn't have done exactly that but absolutely would have retaliated. I'm a fan of direct confrontation for things like this. If you have the balls to call her miss piggy to her face, you could probably do this. Take the food from her while she's eating and either throw it away or put it back in the fridge. But either way, physically remote it from her and block her path to get back to it. Don't stand down and if she complains, start charging her. Like say she ate your takeout leftovers that you spend $20 on and had half of it left. ""That'll be $10 plus +$5 for an inconvenience fee in the fact that this is my food and my house."" &#x200B; But yeah, totally justified imo. And your brother needs to grow a spine and tell her this isn't okay. She probably thinks it's still not a big deal because her bf won't say anything. If you can get him on your side, I'm sure things would be different. "
3,apc2b5,t2_1bdqders,DerHoggenCatten,"ESH. This is the sort of behavior you tend to see in elementary school (on all fronts). I realize that she was being super rude, but your being super rude in return means you are no better. Your brother should have stopped her, stopped bringing her, or replaced the food in some fashion (e.g., buying you take-out). Insulting someone for bad behavior just makes you seem mean. Her bad behavior is a reflection of an eating disorder, but that doesn't make it your problem. It does mean that calling her a pig is like calling a depressed person a party pooper. There was a more mature way to handle it and none of you traveled that path. "
3,apc2b5,t2_2vfmsudw,g0juice,"NTA. Anyone here saying other wise is probably just offended by your comments because they share similarities with the lady in question. She is literally stealing from you. You have tried to be civil and confront her time and time again. Imagine if she was stealing any other resource. People would be pissed. But because we are in the world of anti fat shaming people are going to say it's your fault. Not the lady that knowingly was stealing from you. I have had numerous room mates through the years for all types of different reasons like school, work, friends etc. This is bonkers and it would have come to a head long ago. Imagine if she was stealing money or your clothes. You paid for it and it's YOURS. That's it! Anything else is just someone feeling bad because you oinked at this thief. Honestly if she won't stop and your brother won't make her I would ask them to leave. Sounds like they aren't adults. I've been lurking for a while but I created an account just for this. And I'm tired of the prompt when I go to upvote stuff. "
3,apc2b5,t2_2f6sm83m,TheAccountOnMyPhone,"I say NTA you scold children when they don't stop childish behaviour, sometimes scolding uses mean words. I can understand why people say ESH but I imagine you've been putting up with this for months. It's not like she has any food for you to eat so eye for an eye some other way. I wouldn't want to add a monthly budget titled ""feeding my roommates girlfriend without anything in return."" It would make me get resentful."
3,apc2b5,t2_4tk700v,McBashed,"Unpopular opinion incoming: Sometimes you have to be a dick to get your point across.

Fuck right off. NTA"
3,apc2b5,t2_2o42tdco,L1b3rtyPr1m3," NTA. While what you did was rude, Id still argue its completely justified. Hell I doubt I was the only one thinking ""Id just make a spicy booby trap"" or even go for laxatives. And honestly miss piggy barely classifies as an insult, pre-existing baggage or not. There are far worse things you could have called her. And since she didn't stop/react this way the first time you said it I doubt it really had all that much impact. I would go as far as to say she is victimizing herself right now to get her boyfriend on her (the wrong) side. "
3,apc2b5,t2_9lw9odq,arunphilip,"NTA. And don't offer an apology just to play nice when she returns. Wow, titles can be misleading - just the title made me think it was you who was a slam-dunk TA. I read the narrative, and my next thought is, it's everyone. But then, who was TA first, and who last? She was first TA, for eating your food repeatedly even after being asked not to. Your brother, sad to say, the next, for not putting a stop to it. Your roommate and you finally, for name calling that was mean. But hey, sometimes you have to get down to that level. And your alternative was silly - buying a fridge out of your roommate's and your money just because she (not even a roommate) couldn't control her impulses? Nope, what you did worked, without any passive-aggressive behaviour like having a separate fridge. "
3,apc2b5,t2_nhp0e,GucciJesus,"I'm gonna say NTA. You asked nicely, then told nicely. When the behaviour continued it was always gonna be very aggravating. Yeah, the chick cried and all but it is largely a situation of her own making. Eating other peoples food without permission is rude and ignorant. She was happy enough to cause you guys extra work, and cost you guys extra money. She is a rude person and in the end she was dealt with in the same way she treats others. I wouldn't make a cup of tea in a friends house without asking if that was okay. "
3,apc2b5,t2_8shu44f,jameseglavin4,"NTA. I absolutely despise that attitude of “haha, whatever, AreNt I SooOoo CuUuTeeEe?” when they’re legitimately being a real piece of shit at someone else’s expense. It’s like taking money from her purse and just laughing in her face and saying “awww but I love moneyyyyy” and thinking you’ll get away with it because of some social obligation to a third party. She’s not just being a shithead to you, she’s putting your brother in a terrible position and making them look like absolute trash as a couple. And yes, ignoring repeated polite, firm, or even hostile requests to not steal - and it is stealing - is serious asshole territory. At that point, any verbal abuse is fair game. If she ate my home-cooked leftovers I spent time and money on, I like to think I would wake her up from a dead sleep with a tornado klaxon and harass her with a megaphone until she left or the cops came. Words hurt, yeah, but they hurt less than being pushed or slapped or forcibly kicked out of the apartment. Shit like this makes my blood boil. PS for all the “lock your fridge” suggestions, that should really be at the expense of the brother, if anyone. I don’t care if you left your wallet full of cash on the seat of your unlocked car in broad daylight, while that would be unwise the onus is still on thieves to not steal from people."
3,apc2b5,t2_nyoc7,blueelffishy,"NTA. Yeah its mean but you guys are all adults. Are you not allowed to be a little mean when someone takes all your stuff. Its an in the moment clap back, if it were perpetual bullying thatd make you an asshole"
3,apc2b5,t2_2jcujfgd,majesticjules,NTA Tell your brother you would be happy to apologize for calling her names if she apologizes for eating food shes been asked not to and pays you back for every bite of food she took that wasn't hers.
3,apc2b5,t2_cpdq0,nostromo909,"NTA. People like miss Piggy will stomp all over as long as there are no consequences for their behavior. You confronted her and asked her not to eat your food that you paid for multiple times. You escalated to sarcasm and that still didn’t work. No regard for anyone but herself. Finally you found the silver bullet. It’s too bad you had to resort to name calling and oinking, but she finally got the message. You did what you had to. Sometimes taking the high road doesn’t work, in fact for people like her, they count on it. “Shame, Shane” on your brother for not saying anything. She’s going to walk all over him. "
3,apc2b5,t2_17jjhe,wander-to-wonder,"NTA. You are kind if the asshole, but I don’t know what else you can do. I’m going to go with not the asshole because if the amount of times you have told her to stop eating your food. It is extremely rude and I couldn’t imagine finishing off someone’s leftovers as a guest in a home or another roommates for that matter. How old are you guys? I’m also overweight, but I overeat my own food I buy, not other people’s. Your brother is also the asshole here because she is his guest and he apparently needs to explain boundaries to her. I’d make something with laxatives in it and clearly mark it in the fridge as yours. "
3,apc2b5,t2_20ln9mmn,Nemirel_the_Gemini,"NTA, It is one of my biggest pet peeves when people eat my food without asking. It is super disrespectful. I used to have 2 roommates who would not only eat my food and steal my alcohol (while both being underage), they would also use my dishes and leave them in their rooms unwashed. Eventually, I got a mini fridge and kept all of my food and dishes in my room. I kept my room locked when I was gone. They got pissed and called me selfish but idc food is money and money is tight when you are a student or just got out of school. Honestly I think you should try to keep as much as you can in your room if you can. It may be the only way to solve the problem completely."
3,apc2b5,t2_adjgq,russharv9,"NTA and fuck the opinion of anyone who says differently. She tried to justify eating food that wasn't hers after being asked to stop and the conventional first steps of getting her to stop were ineffective, so OP was forced to find their own method of resolution. They had been calling her that for some time, but refused to stop repeating her actions. This forced OP to step it up and drive home the point that *it's not ok to eat food that doesn't belong to you.* OP didn't do this simply for the reason that she's fat, OP did it because she was willfully acting like a gluttonous asshole."
3,apc2b5,t2_10o15o,Bathroomious,If she's been told again and again not to eat your food but keeps eating it anyway then no amount of polite confrontation is going to stop her.

3,apc2b5,t2_oifqb5y,Avijel,"I'm between NTA and ESH. Her for eating the food which isn't hers (if you are hungry buy your own food) Your brother for not having conversation with her about eating other people's food You but only for comments.

3,apc2b5,t2_gkull,greytarot,"NTA. Food ain't free. Not only does it cost money to buy, but it takes time to make and can cause some big issues (I work nights so I could just imagine getting home, discovering the food I planned to eat was gone, and then not having anywhere else to go buy more food being closed). She refused to stop despite being warned many, many, MANY times. Hell, I've raised hell and highwater in the past over similar stuff with roommates in the past, even if I'm often very lenient about sharing food provided that permission is asked (I usually make at least two large dishes a week that yield several portions, so I try to let my roommates grab a serving each for the two of them). Maybe you could have handled it better, but to be honest? If she's not swinging by, then it sounds like you achieved your goal - at least for the time being. Playing stupid games, winning stupid prizes... All that jazz. Personally, the only option that wasn't explored seems to be the obvious one to me, which is to say that she should pay at least five dollars for each time she eats some leftovers. That should be enough to cover the cost of ingredients used in most cases for a portion at least, but I could totally see someone bumping it up higher if they wanted to do that."
3,apc2b5,t2_hguhx,RiotGrrr1,NTA because it seems like you tried many times before to get her to stop eating your food and it didn’t work. Shes essentially doubling (at least) your food bills. It was kinda a dick thing to do with the pig noises but I don’t blame you since you not were left with many options aside from having to buy another fridge with a lock on it. But I think I’d lock the current fridge and tell your brother he needs to buy himself a fridge since he can’t keep his girlfriend from eating your food. Should be his problem if she comes back. 
3,apc2b5,t2_120l75bb,blitzedginger,"NTA. I don't care what anyone says. She's been stealing from you relentlessly and literally will not stop no matter how many times she's been confronted, to the point of you considering having to buy a second fridge and lock it in your own home. I'd have gone off worse on her and sooner than you did tbh. She can call you an a-hole and cry all she wants now but, hey, at least it got her to stop coming over! Guess that's what it took! In fact, I'd make it clear to both of them (MP and bro) that not only is her now ""refusing"" to come over NOT a threat, but that she's flat-out not welcome there until she acknowledges her crappy behavior & guarantees she won't do it anymore. You have a right to put your foot down when someone else's guest is behaving this badly."
3,apc2b5,t2_fferw,Nitemarephantom,"ESH but that's ok in my book. You're comments were an asshole reaction to an asshole move. It's not like this was the first time and you overreacted. This happens REGULARLY and even after being confronted many time she still does it? Sometimes you need to rise (or lower yourself) to someone's level. Plus as far as I can tell you would've done this even if she were skinny as a rod. It was more commentary on her behavior. Honestly I'm surprised you guys didn't pull the old ""laxatives in the food"" gag. "

She’s making it very obvious that she’s overweight because of her own choices, not genetics...if she ever tried to use that excuse. Food isn’t free. Had this happened once, it would be bad enough. How in the world a grown ass adult thinks this is ok is beyond me... even after being confronted about it, she laughed it off and kept doing it. She’s a spoiled brat, and if your brother isn’t willing to put his foot down, I think you and your other roommate should consider making him pay a certain amount to you every time you catch her doing it. Someone has to pay for your missing food, and it shouldn’t be you. "
3,apc2b5,t2_gyxo6,misternizz,"Yeah, YTA for the fat shaming comments... but I've been in this situation a few times and I completely empathize with why you got driven to do it. You're brother's an asshole for not stepping in and getting her to stop stealing. She's an utter asshole for blatant discourtesy and disrespect of your repeated requests to stop stealing. You should not HAVE to buy a separate fridge and padlock it. That's an awful solution. I don't condone name calling or bullying but in this case it appears to have achieved your objective. She says she won't ever come over, so problem solved. (Edit, last thought) Possible alternative: OP, how do you think asking her to kick in for some of you and your other roomate's food expenses, since you have both involuntarily been put in the role of financially subsidizing her food intake?"

3,apc2b5,t2_53rtx,ShepardG,"NTA Here's the thing I disagree with, considering everyone here saying this is a ESH, scenario. You've literally told her and your brother that this is a problem. They have both disregarded you and your roommates feelings on the mater and not corrected the behavior. Your passive aggressive insults were meant to invoke a reaction, and they were successful. Fuck her, and definitely have a fucking talking to with your brother. When you have clearly exhausted all options, hurting someones feelings is MUCH better than physically hurting them, or worse, bowing to their actions (getting a 2nd fridge with a lock??? really?) I hope she gets help, I feel like people have constantly accepted her inability to control her caloric intake and finally steping up and doing something, even if it was passively, is probably freaking her out. Drop the passive next time, and be a little more forceful with her. ""Stop eating my fucking food, you've been told repeatedly, there are consequences to your actions and i'm literally telling you that those consquences are 1)I kick my brother out of the apartment and you with him 2) I file a police report concerning theft and we let the law deal with it. 3) You continue to promote an unhealthy life style and it's going to kill you early.

3,apc2b5,t2_d2bboh8,TrayusV,"ESH You are most definitely an asshole. The only way I can put it is that you are bullying. In what circumstance is calling someone ""miss piggy"" okay? (I'm not trying to be judgemental, it's a rhetorical question to make OP think about the situation, as is much of what I say against their actions). This girl is also in the wrong, she is eating your food, that you pay for, without permission, despite being told not to. But there are so many better ways to stop this. Simply enough, ban her from the apartment. I'd recommend you stop by a police station and ask about your options, don't just call the cops when she refuses to leave and make a big scene that would end up on trash tv if filmed. Make it very clear that she is trespassing and stealing, and that she is banned from the place. Also, inform your brother before this goes down, don't let the powder keg that is this situation explode all at once. Also consider the cost of food added onto your brother's rent. Talk to your landlord about the situation, keep receipts and add it onto his rent, and take it off yours. That will very quickly force your brother to act against the girlfriend, as it now affects him. Sure, at first you'll keep coming home to see the food you planned to eat is gone, but it will stop once your brother has to pay for it. It's his girlfriend, he's responsible for her actions at your place. See, much better solutions than bullying. Many others are saying that you were justified, but that's not the point here. Regardless of whether OP is justified or not, he is an asshole for bullying someone. So sure, some might think you are justified, but you're still an asshole.

3,apc2b5,t2_r4x6t,FriendlyFellowDboy,"NTA. And here's my reasoning, if it's honestly as bad as you say and there is a complete lack of respect and boundaries with multiple attempts to remedy the situation with zero progression. At this point the end justifies the means, imo. No one but the b.f wants her there, she will not respect the sanctity of your home/food/money if calling her ""miss piggy"" and being albiet completely rude and immature gets her to leave and not come back, than good riddance. Tell the b.f you will apologize when she does, and stop when she does. Otherwise I think the better option, would have been to fuck with the food somehow, obviously in a non-dangerous way, but something that would teach her not to simply take food that is not hers. Maybe a little fib about something foul being in there for any would be thieves. Hindsite is 20/20 though.

Be willing to replace other persons accidentally eaten food immediately by driving to the store if requested to do so. DO NOT drink my alcohol without my explicit permission. If your friends eat someone else’s food or drink, you need to replace it. You may also pay for it plus a $10-$20 dollars more for my time to replace or re-make it. There are very few legal remedies, unfortunately. I am a landlord, and am wary of suggesting anything like trying to add a fee to your brothers rent, charge her, lock her out, or so forth. The best I can suggest is to ridicule her every time she comes over, walk around naked all the time. You could also video her *in common areas like the kitchen* and post it online. You are going to be a big asshole for that, but there are few legal remedies otherwise."

She's eating you out of house and home, refuses to listen when asked not to and that's just fucked. If she doesn't like being called miss Piggy then maybe she shouldn't eat everything in sight"
3,apc2b5,t2_z3kve,arieljoc,"NTA I was ready to say asshole but she’s SO unashamed and doesnt give a fuck. Let her think you’re an asshole, you don’t want her there anyways. Is it shitty to have called her that yea sure maybe a bit, it perhaps it will make her reflect on her choices. Honestly I would put a lock on the door in front of her everytime she’s there. Or even as soon as you see her yell “hey the asshole that steals our food is here grab the lock!!” Any time I saw her eating food at your house, whether hers or yours, id snatch it right from her and start eating it"

You wanted to hurt her. No she shouldn’t eat your food. Name calling isn’t the solution. Think about your brother. He sucks for not assisting in stopping her (that we know of). Now what is he supposed to do. He is now between his gf (unknown seriousness) being super upset and his brother and it all relates to where he lives. Sucks big time. GF obviously doesn’t give a fuck. Second fridge sucks but is a better idea than name calling. Used one can be had for cheap. Ask brother to pay part of it. Another solution is to ask GF or brother to contribute extra and then perhaps you can make additional servings if that isn’t additional work for you. It’s not ideal but hopefully it means you aren’t out of pocket money and you still get your food. 
3,apc2b5,t2_fq3cn,redidiott,NTA You don't get to rob other people and then expect your delicate sensibilities to be tiptoed around. Psychoanalysis mode: maybe food is how people in her family connect and sharing food is a way to feel like part of the group? Idk just spitballing why someone would act like that.

3,apc2b5,t2_ic5rz,NamityName,"NTA, your words were mean but sometimes you have to show a little ass to get things done especially when dealing with other assholes. futhermore, that lady needs to be shamed for her actions; she is an unapologetic thief. they left you few options. you tried talking to them repeatedly. there is not much more you can do without being an ass. your non-ass options are pretty much to buy a locking minifridge and move all your food to that, but that's a major inconvenience that you should not be expected to undergo especially in your situation. you can try filing a police report for the stolen food, but that seems like it would only result in the officers laughing at you. regardless of how you proceed, you should demand that she return her key and to refrain from being in the apartment when your brother is not there. she acts like she lives there. your brother is enabling it. and from a legal perspective this can cause all kinds of problems. Namely, she could have claim to tenancy that would force you to go through legal eviction proceedings to remove her. even if she isn't on the lease, she has a key, she is there most of the time. it's easy to get a bill sent to a new address to confirm residency. i'm not saying this lady would do this. i don't know her. but you should always protect yourself."

3,apc2b5,t2_av1t4,peregrin5,"Yes YTA. It's annoying that she ate your food but your behavior can't really be described as anything but assholeish. Think about what you would think if you saw that scene without any context. You would think the dude was a raging asshole. As for other options you had you could tell your brother that his girlfriend is no longer welcome at your house because she keeps eating your food. You could as you said put a lock on the fridge door and require your brother to store his food elsewhere since his girlfriend is the problem. Calling her names, shaming her bodyweight, there's really no excuse for that."
3,apc2b5,t2_eutmw,rograbowska,"YTA for the clumsiness. it almost sounds like the GF has a compulsive eating disorder, which she should seek help for. Calling her Ms. Piggy and oinking at her is something the villain from a teen movie would do that pushes our heroine over the edge to seek bad-ass revenge. A more sophisticated villain would feign deep concern about her mental health, sit down with her and ask why she seeks fulfillment through her mouth, and whether it’s at all related to the way her family and friends never really liked her. This potentially would disturb her more, and you can claim that you just wanted to help her. Think the psychiatrist Phoebe was dating in an early episode of Friends “remember, Monica: it’s just food, not love.” Say THAT to her every time she eats your food rather than this juvenile Miss Piggy thing. You can do better. "

Its like those annoying people that will laugh through a murder joke, cancer joke but then take it upon themselves to be offeneded by a pedo joke that no victim asked them to be get offended over on their behalf. I had a friend that said if I die of cancer I want you to come to the funeral as a cigarette. This stupid woman out of nowhere goes on about ""how would you feel if you actually had cancer, do you really think that's funny."" Him ""yeah I think it's fucking hilarious especially considering I actually do have cancer."" She fucked off in a Huff. I was in a meeting and someone came up with this example about dating and peacocking, I blurted out its a waste of time I just carry a knife and balaclava to get laid. The point is its a joke, if they get offended that's on them, your still a Jew yourself so bigger reason to give no fucks. A joke is simply that a fucking joke.

What if pushing her into something she didn't want **temporarily**, ultimately helped her in the long run... would that change what you wanted? What if you just wanted a **temporary** 4 month reprieve from the financial burden you now face? Is it possible you are too proud to admit you need help, if only for a few months? > If you’re going to take the job, then you need to own that choice.

By the same logic you can't blame her if she tries and is miserable, which is a distinctly possible scenario, and one you didn't seem to articulate to her. A road to redemption was never given to her in the event of a failure. > It’s not like she can’t keep writing if she takes the job. Somehow she’s convinced herself that it’s all or nothing and now she’s crying. This is true in a few ways, she will have less time (a very valuable resource) to put into her work. Also from her perspective you aren't assuring her that her previous work and any work she would put in when she has the precious time after her job has any value. In short you aren't re-assuring or expressing any confidence in the value of her work (you are upset at her lack of confidence but it's usually a two way street). If you assured her you believed in her then she would make confident decisions. (just a hunch) "
3,b009zd,t2_2nf2f6d5,JackieChansStuntGuy,"NTA at all my dude- first of all for English being second language that was a pretty smooth read. Anyway, I know it feels kinda weird and you feel like an ass because everyone is supposed to love their family/parents right? But the truth is that this is really common, there’s even a subreddit for it. Just because someone gave birth to you (I know you’re adopted but it still applies) doesn’t mean that you automatically have to love/respect them. Tons of people out there are shit human beings, and guess what, that doesn’t deter them at all from procreating. I know it’s hard to look at your mom with criticism, but she’s a human being just like you capable of flaws and imperfections. Her’s just happen to be extreme. Mostly importantly, her decisions and attitude are NOT a reflection of you. You get to break the cycle and be a good momma if you decide to, and that’s awesome. Keep your head up."
3,a65rr1,t2_lf6rd,ACBluto,"YTA I love dogs, but they are still animals. Even the gentlest and mildest dogs can react poorly to strange situations. I don't know where you are from, but nearly all cities have leash laws for this reason. There are often off leash areas you can take your dog to run loose and free - usually gated, fenced parks. If you had control of Milo, he never would have got close enough to have a bag swung at him. So even though you ""immediately stopped"" him, he still got pretty close to someone. Keep your dog on a leash in public, for everyone's comfort and safety. "
3,a65rr1,t2_75wxn,Kll8902,"YTA. Lease laws exist for a reason, both for your dog's safety and the safety of others. A stranger on the street has no clue what your dog is like, and even if they did, they may have their own anxieties involved with dogs, especially kids! You're being incredibly inconsiderate and selfish. On top of that, what happens when your dog sees a shiny across the street and darts into the road, getting hit by a car? Ultimately, it doesn't matter how friendly or nice your dog is, it should always be on a leash unless on your own property or within a fenced dog park space. Anywhere else, and you're always the asshole."
3,a65rr1,t2_1n3567j8,annoyedatlackofuser,"YTA. Hugely. I am extremely wary of dogs. It’s amplified 10X when my kid is with me. I don’t know that your dog is friendly, to me it’s a decent sized animal with severe maiming capabilities running up on me and my kid. Also, I don’t want dog slobber and hair all over me because you can’t control your dog. I will absolutely kick at a dog running up on me. If you want your dog to run free, take them to a park that doesn’t require leashes. Thanks."
3,a65rr1,t2_npcu11l,mathxjunkii,"YTA- for a couple reasons; in this situation, your dog was harmless, but this guy had no way of knowing that. I’m sure he could have picked his kid up or moved further away when he saw the dog approaching, instead of hitting your dog, and that’s on him. But your dog needs to be leashed because people don’t know him the way you do. Also, it’s safer for your dog to be on a leash, because no matter how good or well behaved he is, he’s still an animal, and prompted by a cat or a squirrel, he may dart away from you and end up getting hurt (or sprayed by a skunk!). Another reason: your dog should be a on a leash because my dog is an asshole. Seriously, my dog is a jerk. He loooooves people, he loooooooves children, (he even lays down to play tug-of-war with little kids because he’s aware they’re smaller and not as strong), he’s sooooo well behaved, he walks nicely on a leash too. BUT, he hates other animals. Like HATES anything else with four legs, if he’s on a leash, and they are not (and he hates cats whether he’s on a leash or not lmao). My dog is also VERY strong. If he sees your dog roaming around without a leash, and approaching him, before I see your dog and move my dog out of the way- my dog will lunge at your dog and possibly bite him- and not a gentle bite, I would imagine. I have had him lunge at other dogs before, I had to stand on my dogs leash, and pull him to the ground to keep him from hurting a dog that was 1/5 of his size. The woman who owned the small dog had let her dog off the leash, and yelled to me “don’t worry! He’s friendly” and I told her “great- my dog is not friendly with other unleashed dogs. Don’t do that.” There are sooo many reasons to keep your dog on a leash, for the safety of others, for the safety of the dog, all of that. If you want your dog to have some unleashed play time, take him to a dog park. My dog, and dogs like my dog, will never be present at a dog park, everyone at the dog park will be expecting to be approach by unleashed pups, and all dogs will be licensed and safe, and the area will be fenced in, so they can’t run into the street. "
3,a65rr1,t2_tm0xn,shikonnotama,"YTA. People in my complex always let their dogs approach me or my dog without asking for permission first and get all flustered when I asked them to call back their dog. I don't give a shit if your dog is nice, make sure it's okay before they approach another living being. Also, if you continue walking him without a leash, you should still bring it with you as a precaution. Just because your dog is nice doesn't mean other dogs will be too. "
3,a65rr1,t2_16tjeror,yougottamovethisss,"YTA. I'm a dog owner with super duper gentle pugs and, unless we're in an official off-leash dog area- I would never let them roam solo. They'd never hurt ANYONE, but I don't know how others feel about dogs or if someone is allergic, etc. Public territory should be a safe space for those who do not want to interact with your dog. &#x200B; And this is coming from someone who legitimately will ask to touch any dog that she sees -- but thinking of being on the other side of this, I understand why it's unfair to those around you, no matter how gentle Milo is. You don't know if someone is allergic or if another dog could go after Milo or if something in Milo snaps or if a passerby has been bitten by a dog before and is uncomfortable, etc. You need to be responsible here."
3,a65rr1,t2_ngykgzr,RealAbstractSquidII,"YTA Leaving your dog off leash on a public walk is bad for many reasons. 1. There are leash laws pretty much everywhere. You likely violated the law which could subject you to fines of significant amount if an officer or dog warden decided to stop you. If done enough, in rare cases the warden will begin proceedings to confiscate your dog due to negligence. 2. You have no idea what could happen to your dog. He could easily run in front of car. He could excitedly run into a small child and injure them. He could get anxious and snap at/bite someone. He may approach someone whose been bitten before or is scared of dogs. This person may react violently to your dog, like what happened in your post. He could run away. Someone could snatch him if he got away from you. And more. 3. If an unleashed dog approaches a person in a precieved aggressive manner, it is legal in most areas to use force to prevent the dog from injuring you. In many US states shooting your dog would have been a legal action in this scenario. 4. Just because YOUR dog is friendly DOES NOT mean that dog hes running after is. If the leashed dog then attacked your dog, you and your dog would be held legally liable because your dog was off leash and you were not in control. This could also kill your dog. This could also put your dog on the bite registry and at risk for euthanasia. If you are in the US most US states have a 2 bite law. If your dog snapped at, nipped or bit ANYONE or anyone's pet while off leash you are fined and your dog is put on a biter registry. If your dog then bites, nips or snaps at anyone or anyones pet a second time the dog is confiscated by your local warden and euthanized. There are no other options as the dog is then deemed too aggressive to rehab. The burden of prevention is on the owner and only the owner. Allowing your dog off leash in a public area that's populated (like the street/sidewalk or parks) is negligent and carries many consequences. It does not matter how friendly your dog is WITH you. He may be the bubbliest happiest creature to ever walk this earth. There are still factors at play in his behavior - such as if hes frightened, injured, approached wrongly or a number of other variables. As a dog owner you have the duty to protect your dog and to protect others from your dog by following local ordinances, law and common sense. If you are in public use a damn leash. They are there for a reason. If you don't like clipping a leash to a neck collar there are thousands of harnesses to choose from That will not injure your dogs neck/throat. If you cannot be a responsible owner while in public do not own a dog. "
3,a65rr1,t2_ob36p,Excal2,"YTA big time. The leash doesn't just keep other people safe from your dog, it keeps your dog safe from other people. For example, in the US in states with legal concealed carry of firearms that old man could have shot your dog on the spot and faced little to no punishment. You love your dog and that's cool but his safety trumps your imaginary projection of his desire for ""freedom"". "
3,a65rr1,t2_1un815gk,Avaylon,"YTA, sorry. The guy sounds like he overreacted, but a loose dog can be dangerous especially to small humans. I have a number of neighbors who let their dogs off leash. One is fine, one is questionable (charges up to my dogs but hasn't actually been aggressive yet), and one has shown aggressive behavior to me by charging up to me and stiff legging/growling at me in my own yard. I'm getting ready to call animal control on that last one."
3,a65rr1,t2_2avq4hk3,vertigoedge,"YTA If you've ever been bit by a dog, you will Never trust 'He doesn't bite' again! Also the man was with his kid, if his kid decided to launch a hug around Milo with no notice are you positive your dog wouldn't have snap in surprise? I know someone with a 3 inch scar on their cheek from that very scenario. Milo should be at your side on the leash while you walk when you see other people who don't know you or your dog."
3,a65rr1,t2_zjf7j,Triknitter,"YTA. I had a dog who loved walks. She hated strange dogs (there were a few dogs she got along with, but introductions were slow and supervised by a trainer). Assholes like you who couldn’t be bothered to leash their ducking dogs meant that she had to be muzzled for walks because while your dog may be friendly, *mine was not.*"
3,a65rr1,t2_prv9m,MayorMcBees,YTA look at my dog. Big sweet Burnese who loves everyone and I've never even seen snarl. However she has a weird fetish for little old Asian ladies (I don't know don't ask) and likes to run at them full speed to give them kisses. Obviously they are frightened so after our first and only unfortunate trip to a dog beach off leash she's always on one. 
3,a65rr1,t2_hwwhk,cap826,"YTA do not take your dog out in public off leash. Here’s a personal story that illustrates why, I was hired as a dog walker. The dog I was walking for a week was very lovely and friendly to his owners and me once I was properly introduced, but this dog was very defensive and did not like strangers or strange dogs. We will call him Zach. Zach wasn’t aggressive but he would bark and growl at people and dogs who approached him. Because of this I kept him on a short lease and avoided people while walking him. This was pretty easy as Zach’s house was in a quiet spot right on the water. One day I was walking him back to the house along the shore and out of nowhere another dog runs up from behind me and smashes into Zach. I was startled and so was Zach. This big golden was obviously very excited and just wanted to play. Zach was barking and growling, trying to get away from the golden, I tried to get Zach out of there asap but the golden kept running around us trying to play with Zach. The Golden’s owner came into sight and shouted for his dog who didn’t respond. The Golden’s owner shouted to me that he was friendly. It didn’t matter Zach was becoming increasingly agitated and either I or the golden could have gotten bit. I shout for the guy to call his dog and his dog won’t come, too distracted. He has to run over and grab his dog before I can get moving on my way with Zach. Luckily no one got bit but it could have been a bad situation. Please keep your dog on a leash. Sorry for the giant text block."
3,a65rr1,t2_ssmbi,Bearded4Glory,YTA There may b places nearby where you are allowed to walk with your dog off leash. Don't do it just down the street. Dogs like my dog can sometimes have an issue with another dog and while your dog is friendly if your dog approaches mine I might not be able to pull mine away if your dog keeps following us.
3,a65rr1,t2_t5stfs7,HilariousInHindsight,"YTA. People don't know you or your dog and every single shitty pet owner says their dog doesn't bite. They're animals, you never know when he might act like an animal and do something unpredictable to a stranger and even if he never does it can be intimidating to strangers to have an unknown dog approach them. The world doesn't revolve around you or your dog, if you want to give him freedom then take him to a dog park. Leash laws exist for a reason."
3,a65rr1,t2_1vqodz9e,killawhale27,YTA. I have a rottweiler who used to be friendly towards other dogs but had a traumatic experience and is now terrified if a dog runs up to her. When I walk her I'm always scared that a loose dog is going to run up to us and she'll attack it out of fear. You never know what other dogs you'll come into contact with out there. 
3,a65rr1,t2_1ofh9lx3,Azzie94,"YTA. Ok, I'm gonna break this down, nice and slow, because apparently you need it. Leash. Your. Dog. I don't care that he doesn't bite. I don't care that he's ""super nice and OMG THE BEST DOG EVA!!!"" Your dog is: 1.) An animal. And a predatory animal at that. Predatory animals have this little thing called 'prey instinct.' What is that? It means that, no matter how domesticated a species is, no matter the breed, if something small and/or high pitched comes across as prey, there's an instinct to absolutely murder the ever living fuck out of it. 2.) A stranger. The guy didn't know your dog. If I were in his position, and a dog came up to my kid with ANYTHING looking like aggression, your dog is getting grabbed by the neck, and pinned to the ground. Now, that doesn't seem to be the case. Milo seemed to be chill by just ""sniffing his hand"", but a stranger (especially someone who could be unfamiliar with dogs) has no idea how to read the dog or the situation. Leash laws aren't just there to protect other people from an aggressive dog. They're also there to protect your dog from people who don't know how to handle having a dog in their space. If you don't respect those laws, you're showing an incredible amount of disrespect to other people, and you're putting your dog at risk of being hurt. I'm sorry if I came off like I'm being condescending, but Christ on a bike. Leash your dog in public. Always. End of story."
3,a65rr1,t2_qww1jx8,astral_fae,"ESH. While I agree you shouldn't let your dog off leash because strangers don't know your dog like you do, there is no excuse to be violent towards an animal that wasn't acting threatening first.

This asshat over reacted really badly. Reason I say info was due to was it a public area like a park or just somewhere to walk? Because having the dog off the lead causes problems for other dogs that are of a poorer disposition. I get pissy at dogs off the lead where I walk because my dog is very energetic and has not had much interaction with other dogs, he gets a bit nervous and one yappy little shit one day was off the lead and would not leave my dog alone, despite me walking away in multiple directions. The owner was so nonchalant to the event that he came over like ""oh my dog is a good dog which is why he is off the lead - he never instigates any trouble"" Wanted to drop kick the owner over the fence and play fetch with his dog. I digress, keep doggo on lead fren and you wont have cunts come up to you and mistreat you and doggo."

3,aidx3a,t2_48kjz,Teshi,"NTA. Skiing is a pretty high-intensity experience and lots of people find it unnerving. Over time, you might learn to enjoy it... or you might not. But you're right, it doesn't matter, and it should be optional for you to participate. Whether you go on the trip or not depends on what there is to do aside from downhill skiing where you are going. Is there hiking? Cross country skiing? A town? Will you be in a nice chalet/hotel/house where you can sit around and read books while the others ski? Your husband is kind of a jerk for suggesting you should see a doctor for not enjoying skiing, but hopefully mostly he's just saddened that you can't enjoy this activity with him. Stand your ground on the skiing, say you're happy to go with them on the holiday and meet for lunch and dinner and whatever it is they will do aside from skiing, but you're not into downhill skiing, and you're not going to ski. *Which is fine; lots of people don't really enjoy things like roller coasters and downhill skiing*. I think that people that enjoy such activities sometimes regard them as indicative of a strength of spirit or being in the tough ""in crowd"" of adrenaline junkies, and get kind of weird about others just not wanting to participate. Sort of similar to those people who are offended when people don't drink, or won't get drunk. Both are super optional activities, but certain people think that meeting people who have these preferences need to be ""fixed"". With that in mind, try to steer to conversation away from this disliking skiing being a pathology (an illness) towards being a simple preference. It's not like he doesn't have anyone else to ski with. You can go, or not, whatever he prefers, but you won't be skiing. End of conversation."

In your early 20s you'll probably get some pressure and teasing for it because people tend to drink a lot socially at that age and can't comprehend why anyone wouldn't, but at a certain point your peers will get over it and nobody will bat an eye at ""no thanks, I don't drink."" No need to explain yourself or give a TED Talk. Just decline, and if anyone's like ""OMG SERIOUSLY? YOU NEED TO LOOSEN UP."" or something like that, I think the best reaction is to just look at them and deadpan respond, ""I don't know if you meant to sound incredibly rude just now, but you did.""

My fiancé has had her since she was a little puppy, 16 years. She has always slept in his bed and then our bed. When it states we kept her in the bed, tried diapers or just taking her out right before bed and then really early. We finally agreed she had to go in her bed, I was the most resistant, well after the dog. For a week we would have to get up and physically put her back in the bed when she would try to jump up.

And kids are definitely hard enough to cook for without trying to change up their entire diet. He's the one being unreasonable wanting a separate menu for himself, or for wanting everyone in the family to change what they're eating because he is. Again, he's making himself the center of everything and apparently justifying it by being the breadwinner. That's very disrespectful of you and how much work YOU do to take care of four children \*plus\* him. That's not nothing. Frankly, and I don't want to be rude to either of you here, but if he wanted a dynamic that was more ""luxurious"" and focused on him, with a wife who caters to him in exchange for her being SAH, then he shouldn't have had 4 kids. Because with that large of a family, sorry, there's not a lot of money or space left for doing extra work & special requests. He ALSO shouldn't be going off on you for ""mindlessly supporting the meat industry"" and whatever. Again, self-centered and disrespectful. IMO he needs to check himself and realize that you're in this together and that taking care of this family is a lot of work \*for everyone\*. It's not about just him and he's not some old-timey Alpha Patriarch the whole family revolves around. You're working just as hard as he is and he NEEDS to acknowledge that. "

3,ati7b2,t2_bdxuc,IDUNNstatic,"NAH/NTA veganism is hard to wrap your head around (pm me for some kid friendly vegan recipes! I'll give you a killer lasagna one) So it's not assholey to stick to what you know. Especially if you have a budget. Specifically vegan food (like mock meat) are super expensive - but plant based food can actually end up being cheaper. I've dated people who eat meat and I've never made them accommodate for a diet that is as tricky as mine, but at the same time I don't have the added bonus of being in a committed relationship with kids either, so while I get where he and you are both coming from, I also don't. He's probably only just learned about some harsh realities of agriculture, and it's natural to want to shout if off the rooftops, but if I, personally, was to talk to him right now, I would tell him that he's being an ass. And that he's hurting his own cause by neglecting his family. I know your kids are fussy. But I personally feel like they should be a little more grateful for the food they're given. If you're living on a budget they need to figure out that what you serve them is what they will eat. I came from a family life that lived pay check to pay check. If I didn't want the food.

Your reasons sound like inconveniences, not some insurmountable labor that would detract from your duties as a mother and homemaker. If supporting your husband's passions and core beliefs are inconvenient for you, perhaps cooking for him is the least of your problems. Out of love for you, he should not have burdened you with his idiosyncrasies. Out of love for him, you should not marginalize his beliefs as a burden that you cannot bear. "

Veganism doesn’t have to be all new food, You already eat vegan food daily. But veganism is a major diet change, and it’s a whole new way of learning to cook and look at food. You’re NTA for not making everything vegan and switching overnight, but if you refuse to even try or think of ways to support your husbands diet and have your kids learn healthier food skills, you kinda suck. But really, your husband is the one who needs to take initiative and cook veggie burgers one night or bean tacos or veggie pasta or whatever. If he’s not doing any cooking at all, then yeah he’s being a dick. But you two together could learn some new recipes that the whole family enjoys and could benefit from. "
3,ati7b2,t2_buay1,centurion44,"NTA but your husband is. I'd rather go to work than take care of a household with 4 young children in it.

3,ati7b2,t2_onn4j,ChefChopNSlice,"NTA. If your hubby decides to suddenly change his diet and has been “reasarching it” you better tell him to start looking up some recipes and learning how to cook. I grew up in a home with the mantra “if you don’t like it or don’t wanna eat it, then go make *yourself* something else”. You’re also making lunches for him, and he’s this ungrateful ? Having picky-eater kids sucks enough as it is. Finding something that 4 of them will eat is hard enough, and that’s if they’re “typical kids” - my son is autistic and a hell of a fucking picky eater - I get it. Budgeting isn’t easy, and making it all work takes some effort. The last thing you need is a nearly 40 year adult acting like a 5th child in your home. Next time you get any shit from him, tell him to mow the lawn and make himself a nice salad."
3,ati7b2,t2_acmcq,Amonette2012,"NTA, it's not a great idea to feed kids a vegan diet anyway. Too easy for them to be malnourished. Plus you're already feeding four picky kids, you don't need to up that to five. He should be supporting you in keeping meals on track, not throwing in curve balls. Cooking for six every day is already a hefty job; asking you to change the way you do it completely when you're already accommodating his veggie diet is just unreasonable. If he wants to get into food, he can spend his free time on it, not demand more of yours. He's not just asking you to budget for and make different food, but to learn a new style of cooking and start working with unfamiliar ingredients. That's too much. Typically the person going on the food adventure does the cooking. However I have a suggestion for you to meet him half way. Plus, cooking for vegans when not everyone is vegan is a bitch. Is it possible that when you're cooking for the family, you could set aside some of the ingredients for him to cook with? For example if you were using veggies, you could set aside part of the chopped stuff for him to make something with when he gets home. That way he doesn't have to do the full prep for it but you don't have to cook the food. "
3,ati7b2,t2_7mzha,k9centipede,"NTA. My siblings are strong vegans so compromises in that area are known to me. Maybe talk about a compromise of finding a place in your budget for easy to cook vegan stuff like frozen vegan burgers, etc. So he can have a easy vegan meal. And maybe once a week do a vegan family meal. Maybe one he plans himself to offset the stress. See where you CAN convert to vegan options in the house. Soy Milk cooks the same as regular milk. Margarine instead of butter. A lot of vegan cheese options are pretty authentic. Having vegan options isnt as daunting as it sounds. But he should be putting in the leg work to get things set up instead of just treating you like a short order cook. "
3,ati7b2,t2_2bn9nezk,hazelchicken,"No. **NTA.** When I went vegetarian my father (who cooked for the family) accommodated it when it would mainly fit with the rest of the plans for dinner, but I knew I'd be making most of my own meals otherwise. You can make your lasagna vegan, you can make vegan versions of everything - but that's expensive. and vegan cheese is horrid. Its far cheaper to just make proper vegan meals that aren't cheap copies of meat-based meals, but... you have a bunch of kids who *aren't vegan!* His diet is not your job. His diet is his own choice and responsibility. You can only stretch yourself so far. "
3,ati7b2,t2_f8uiz,ipsum629,"NTA but also I have some pointers for arguing with vegans. You aren't going to win by saying ""it's to inconvenient"". You need to attack the core reason why they are vegan. They think they are making a difference. If you can make them doubt this for a second, your husband won't bother you. The thing is, it's not our choices that determines what is sold in stores. It is what is most profitable. Because of things like subsidies for meat, meat will always be profitable. Corporations will always have more resources to push for meat to be consumed. Being vegan doesn't even put a dent into their bottom line because they still make money selling vegan foods. By bothering others about not being vegan, your husband is playing right into the hands of the real bad guys by taking blame away from the food companies and onto consumers. This is the same shit they did to get us to blame ourselves for not throwing away coke bottles when they are the ones that made them non reusable."
3,ati7b2,t2_nfbx2,GetWrekt420,"YTA, in my book... can you at least attempt to compromise? Look up some recipes? Ask him to look up recipes? Going vegan is tough, but not all of the dishes are that fancy, and maybe he wouldn't mind having his own separate meal... I get it your kiddos are picky, but it still sounds pretty lazy pf you to just... refuse to look into it. Discuss moving things in your budget for his new food preferences and see if hed be willing to help with his special meal prep...ffs... you're lucky he makes enough to support you and that many children. If he chooses to go vegan you should suck it up and add it to your routine. "
3,ati7b2,t2_resnoyi,domesticatedfire,"NTA, but you could get him the basics and just load up on salad fixings. He can make his own salad dinners and if he wants something more fancy, then tough noodles, he can cook it himself. If he does do this **please** remember to load up on vegan fats (coconut oil, nuts, etc) and proteins. If he's not already on a multivitamin, find him a vegan one. I've had lots of friends who try to do an extremely limited and lazy vegan, and they can get MAD mood swings from improper eating (I think this is where some of the crazy militant vegans come from tbh...). If your DH is already being a booger, then I pray that his eating habits won't make it worse; vegan can't necessarily fix unhappiness, in my experience, it usually just makes you hungrier... My husband and I switched to keto, and for a bit there I was exhausted and he was constantly grumpy. Turns out I was just bad at eating enough Vitamins B and D, and he wasn't consuming enough salts :/ a daily vitamin and electrolyte drink fixed us both up :) I'd make it a point that *he* needs to come up with a meal plan and food prep for himself. Plenty of other adults with full time jobs manage to do this, why not him? Good luck OP!"
3,ati7b2,t2_5gbjl,blackdragon8577,"NTA You have kids. Those kids are very likely not going to enjoy or go along with a vegan menu. If he wants to be vegan, great. He can take care of himself. You cook for the family. You don't go to his job and make it harder and tell him what to do. He shouldn't be doing that to you, because your job is raising the kids and taking care of the house. It sounds like he thinks he is your boss. You guys are partners. He can't make unilateral decisions that really don't impact him but cause a lot more work for you. Basically, if he wants to eat vegan, he is welcome to and he can secure his own food. You are cooking for the family that has young children and you do not have the time and energy it would take to cook two completely separate meals. "
3,ati7b2,t2_352pv7s5,jeanbean15,"NTA because you’re not obligated to accommodate him. However, on a separate note, just the way you describe veganism and how he talks about it in your most makes me assume that you’re actually not very supportive of his decision. It can be hard to read tone over the internet so maybe I’m wrong. It kind of sounds like you’re unwilling to try to support him at all. You’re not obligated to accommodate him, like I said, but honestly it’s not hard to plan a few easy vegan dinners a couple nights a week, and I think it would be kind of you to show you support him in that way. Spaghetti is an easy one, just cook the meat on the side and skip the cheese on his plate. Make some garlic bread with olive oil on the side. I think your husband would appreciate it and feel loved and supported. You can make a lot of dishes vegan just by skipping the meat, and cheese, replacing the butter with oil. If you’re up for it, it’s not hard and you don’t have to waste an entire grocery shopping trip like you’re concerned about. "
3,ati7b2,t2_uyh5oq,PatientFM,"NTA 100%. You've got enough to deal with already. He needs to take on the responsibility for this lifestyle change if that is what he really wants. He is asking a lot and there are only so many hours in the day. Personally, I would be more receptive to cooking for him if he did all the necessary research for me to be able to buy and cook what he wants easily and on a budget. Maybe this could be a compromise? However, if this is simply not possible for you, then do not bend to the pressure. You sound like you're already working your butt off for the family and you should be proud of your hardwork! "
3,ati7b2,t2_yj4o8,PM_TITS_OR_DONT,"NTA. I think he's being absurd throwing a fit like that. You're an ""asshole supporting the meat industry?"" You're his fucking *wife*, and he ate meat while you were making four children together. He owes you an apology. Under the fit he's throwing, I do think you could support him in eating vegan himself to some degree. Telling him ""I can't do it"" seems like too much. Saying you won't cook for him anymore seems like too much. You're a team, right? You want him focusing on the job he's doing while you take care of the home front. Like, obviously it's too much for you to throw out a bunch of dishes your kids will eat out of the rotation and make vegan dishes just to cater to him. You're not going to stop making your signature dish, for instance. And it's too much for you to make a whole separate home-cooked dinner for him on top of what you're cooking for the kids. But maybe you can reassure him that you aren't telling him he needs to cook for himself 7 nights a week or anything. Like, he needs to expect to eat a bunch of garden burgers. And maybe he needs to hear that you take pride in your cooking and don't *like* the idea of serving him crap like that. "
3,ati7b2,t2_1m3h7gi5,fliffers,"NTA at all. You'd have two options if you supported it and he still expected you to cook for him. 1) you cook vegan for him and normally for everyone else, which means your budget for groceries gets cut so you can buy smaller portions of a large variety of food. Vegan alternatives are usually more expensive, and you won't be able to buy as much in bulk or the proper proportions to feed everyone else at the same price. You also now have to cook more meals, even if you share some dishes, there will be many meals you'll have to make separately. This is a really unreasonable strain on your time and budget. 2) you rework the budget and all your meals and feed everyone the same thing. Vegan food can be expensive, so it takes a lot of effort to figure this out. It's also *very* dangerous to put young children on a vegan diet because they need so many specific nutrients and you *must* ensure you're cooking foods that will give them all of these things. Between them being picky eaters, and the extra time it can take to prep and cook meals that are suitable alternatives, and the entire idea of feeding a four year old a vegan diet, this is so highly unrealistic and could go badly really, really easily. If he wants different meals, he should have to rework the budget to figure it out, and he can take the time to cook and prep them. Yes, he does work a lot, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have to contribute or that he's doing you a huge favour (as if taking care of four young kids, your house, and husband is no work at all!!!). When he asks what the point of you staying at home is if you can't support this means that he doesn't consider everything you do to be supporting him. I think you need to sit down and tell him about the budget and the time, and why the two current options don't work. And if he says something about support, maybe taking the opportunity to explain what your day as a SAHM really entails, and all the behind the scenes that he doesn't see and needs to start appreciating. Maybe it's for the best that this happens, because it sounds like he doesn't appreciate it enough as is."

Prior to being ill (in a previous relationship) I was the breadwinner while he stayed at home. Anyway, you’re not part of “the staff”! Taking care of kids (especially young kids) is really hard work. And trying to shop for groceries and do housework with them in tow can be impossible. Cooking for them is a pain. One week they like chicken nuggets, the next week chicken nuggets are “yucky”. If he wants to radically change his diet, that’s fine but why do you need to be the one to implement it? The HARDEST part of going vegan is figuring out all the foods you can eat and figuring out how to cook them. Friends of mine have spent hours online researching this stuff for their own diets. Not only that, but it wastes money at first because brands of different foods are different tasting and there’s a lot of trial and error. Not to mention that there might be new cooking techniques and styles with the various recipes, some of which you may not be comfortable with depending on your ability. If this is something he wants to do, then he needs to do the work instead of making you do it for him. "
3,ati7b2,t2_tjl1lzb,crinnaursa,"NTA this isn't just adding new recipes to your repertoire or new ingredients to your pantry. Part of the issue in here is what he's asking you do to do is not even the first step. Going from omnivore to vegetarian is manageable because it inherently is a little more flexible. The transition for you is not as extreme because it's just a matter of omitting meat products. Going from vegetarian to vegan is another matter entirely. I'm not sure it would even stop with the menu change. What happens when he starts worrying about cross-contamination from the foods that you are eating. Or if he gives you issues with you eating an omnivore diet around him. or when he begins to take issues with the products you use in the house for self care. Or the items of clothing that you choose. Veganism should be a personal choice. In a marriage personal choices should not negatively affect your partner or children. He doesn't seem like he's considering anyone else in this but himself. On a side note, because he mentioned extreme or life-changing health effects as reasons for going vegan you might want to watch out for Orthorexia. It's kind of new in the medical field regarding eating disorders. "

There are a ton of recipes that are easy, flavorful, and suitable for picky eaters. It's just going to take a while to find them. So maybe talk to your husband about spending some time each weekend looking for recipes and cooking together. Also look into ""accidentally"" vegan foods that you probably already eat, or would be familiar. Spaghetti with marinara sauce is vegan. Meatballs, parmesan, sausage etc. can all be cooked on the side. You can make a veggie stir fry with rice, add some roasted chicken for everyone else and top his with some crispy baked tofu. There are a ton of resources in the internet so that you don't have to figure it all out yourself. I think if you were both open to seeing this as a journey you are on together rather than a fight you are on opposite sides of that would help a lot."

That said, I don't think it should be on you to come up with vegan meals for him to eat. Initially, he really needs to be taking the initiative and maybe figuring out what he could make that would be easy for you to add to in order for your kids to be open to eating it. He's the one that should be researching recipes. Does he ever do the cooking, like on weekends? My mom was a SAHM and cooked on weeknights. My dad cooked on weekends. "

Point is he needed to give you all time to adjust but shouldn't expect all of you to cater to his diet. For the record, veing vegan or vegetarian is not a cruelty free way of eating. My grandfather was a farmworker and the working conditions are absolutely horrendous. No animals are hurt but the human toll is often ignored."
3,ati7b2,t2_77kf9,zombielunch,"NTA. Vegatarian is hard enough, going vegan is a stricter regime and having picky eaters on top of that is near impossible. Your husbands reaction was over the top. I have made it clear with my husband and kids, I make one meal. If you dont like it, you don't have to eat it but do not expect me to cook and cleanup another meal. Only exception is when people get sick. We are lucky, no one has food allergies. Maybe try to meet him part way if he apologizes. Have him go shopping with yoy and have him meal prep on Sunday."
3,ati7b2,t2_32yzdxc3,mlenzac,"YTA If you had a child who was gluten intolerant you would look to cater for them. I am not vegan or vegetarian or anything of the like and I hate the whole ""holier than thou"" vegans/vegetarians who think it is their right to impose their will and choices on others. However.. He pays for you to be a stay at home parent and one of those is ensuring each of the individuals in the house has suitable options to eat and there are a lot of options for vegans, including vegetarian lasagne etc. If he is the only one, then you could always cook up a vegetarian lasagne (plenty of recipes online) and have him eat that over a few meals by freezing it etc. If he was trying to force you and the kids to join him in the journey and you said no.. well that is fair enough, but he just seems to want to ensure he can have vegetarian meal to eat at dinner with his family? You have chosen to be the one responsible for that. "
3,ati7b2,t2_ijk6v,RachyRachington,"NTA. Is he such a man baby that he can’t collaborate with you to sort his own meals out? (Ie making something that you can separate and add meat too ie paella, pasta dishes roast dinners as he just needs to cook his own meat alternative and have the same veg) vegan food is easy once you get the hang of it and with some experimenting but you should not be responsible for this alone. Everyone should be looking to cut down on their meat and dairy for the sake of the planet but again, he can’t leave this up to you! Edit: you should be willing to collaborate and your post isn’t clear. If not then you’re both the ass holes. Further edit; if this helps popular to contrary belief vegan food is cheaper if it’s mainly whole foods (not relying on meat replacements and expensive cheese alternatives) Last edit I promise; wow so many ignorant embarrassing opinions from both sides! "
3,ati7b2,t2_12202f,peanutbuttershrooms,"NTA - you and your kids don't have to conform to his new diet. He is a big boy and can cook for himself. That being said maybe theres a compromise somewhere? Maybe agree that you'll make one vegan dinner a week that you think the kids will enjoy (throw some cheese on top of their plate or something if need be). Or make him one large meal that he can then reheat every night for a week. I feel like vegan spaghetti would be pretty easy, you could even make just a little bit of vegan sauce for him and then put meat and cheese on your spaghetti."
3,ati7b2,t2_b6iaca6,Boreall,"Would have been NAH but he blew up at you for not wanting to learn an incredibly complex new diet, new dishes, cooking either two meals a night or starve your children, all for something optional? NTA but your husband is being one"

My mother made us do a cleanse/basically go vegan for part of one summer and I threatened to literally move in with relatives for the entire summer because I was not eating her crazy food. You're right for not wanting to shift everything up just to accommodate him
3,ati7b2,t2_4h063,dreadneck,"INFO - Could you both meal prep beans, rice, 1-2 inexpensive vegetables, some dessert containing fresh fruit for one week and then some sort of vegan lasagna the next week? The two desires (Him having a vegan dinner and you not having an increased workload and staying on budget) are not incompatible. Having elaborate vegan meals when you have four children in the house is not a realistic desire, but basic nutritious meals that are easy to prepare in advance is not. AND he can help make that happen."

Once you really start to look at the dairy industry, it bothers you heaps. He probably also doesn't understand how hard it is to feed picky children....or even to be a SAHM. However, it's so much easier now to cook nice vegan meals. You could try having meat free monday, where everyone gets the one meal. I'd suggest not telling your kids that's what it is though....that's bound to make them fussy on principle. Spoken as a former fussy child. You could make it spaghetti Bolognese night, and use lentils instead of mince, or a meat free mince. "
3,ati7b2,t2_13qn0t,kR4in,"NTA. It looks to me as if he started making decisions that he expects you to follow blindly... If he is now saying you're supporting the meat industry. Sure, he's done his research and he is making changes to his life as he sees fit, but you have not seen that research. He can't just jump right to ""Hey I'm vegan now and I just need you to cater to that, okay thanks"" when there's been no other discussions about this. "
3,ati7b2,t2_vexb3qn,ArcadeKingpin,"NTA. But can I help offer some advice? Help him a bit by making a couple things like stews vegan. One of my favorites is shakshuka. It's easy to add egg and shredded chicken or pork. Pick a day to do some meal prep and do things like pulled pork and shredded chicken that can be added to your meals. Making tacos for him with avocado instead of chicken won't be too hard. If you would like any more suggestions I love taking food and would be more than willing to share ideas on how to make this work, on a budget, and maybe even have a little fun!"

3,ati7b2,t2_dkkce,poltyy,"NTA. You don’t stay home for fun, it’s to raise your children. He’s minimalizing your job and life’s work by saying what’s the point of “him” working so much. Meanwhile, four kids are an awful lot of work that he doesn’t seem to acknowledge, even if two are at school all day. "
3,ati7b2,t2_2pfsrpct,thisiswhatweget1739,"NTA - you could try to have a few standby alternatives that he'll eat but if he's all of a sudden going vegan then he should realize it's a personal choice, not one to be pushed on his family because he takes on radical beliefs. If it were a dietary issue like he can't eat cheese anymore because he became lactose intolerant or he had Crohn's and couldn't eat gluten that would be a different story but still wouldn't necessitate you and the kids to adopt the same restrictions."
3,ati7b2,t2_reifg,bakersmt,"NTA - I developed severe allergies to a ton of foods and had to decipher which ones were causing issues. So I had too do a severely limited diet while working part time and going to school full time. I took on the responsibility of cooking for the household. I don't have kids but I didn't expect my S.O. to shoulder the burden of my new dietary restrictions. The duty was previously shared. I still do the cooking because of my restrictions. If he wants something that I can't eat he has to step up and cook it himself. We currently both work full time and I'm in school part time. It's entirely unrelated for anyone to expect you to accommodate a dietary wish. He needs to do his homework and learn how to be a vegan. It's intense to learn all of that, and with 4 children, oh hell no! That's a massive sense of entitlement if I've ever heard of one, wow."
3,ati7b2,t2_z3pn6,zombie_goast,"NTA at all. Vegetarian cooking? Easy peasy, just avoid meat no big deal. Vegan cooking? EXTREMELY difficult, especially on a tight budget, and even MORE so with little ones who, picky eating aside, NEED all the basic food groups (I am very against putting kids on vegan diets simply because it is so easy to screw it up and give your kids certain types of vitamin deficiencies since their little bodies are growing. Again vegetarian is fine though). You need to respect your husband's choice, but it goes both ways, he needs to respect your choice *not* to as well. "
3,ati7b2,t2_7i4vc,hallgod33,"NTA, he's going through some changes and needs to sort it out on his own. Being vegan vs vegetarian is a huge jump, and requires a lot of supplements that are rather expensive to maintain optimal health. That's why vegetarians have existed as long as recorded history, but vegans haven't; the inclusion of yogurt, eggs, milk, etc was essential to live to adulthood up until quite recently in human history. If he wants to avoid those as well for moral reasons concerning animal welfare, he's gotta take that burden on himself. If you don't agree, sucks to be him unless he is able to emotionally blackmail you into picking up HIS slack. I was vegan for 18 months, which was pretty easy being mainly vegetarian most my life, and I got reeeaaaaalllly sick. I had to go in the opposite direction of all meat for 6 months to repair my gut lining, and restore my vitamin and mineral balances, so I'd personally tell him he's gonna compromise his children's growth over this but that's emotional blackmail xD Either way, good luck. Veganism is the biggest fad right now, and hopefully he doesn't lose any teeth over it due to the decay that many face. "
3,ati7b2,t2_9cbmh,Imago_Mothtoya,"NTA. You have four kids to take care of. That’s a full-time job and him going vegan is going to cause more work for you, more problems with trying to get the kids to eat, and will probably ruin your budget unless you all go vegan, which doesn’t sound like it’s an option. If he wants to go vegan, he needs to take responsibility for his own meals. My wife is a SAHM, but I do the cooking when I get home from work because I enjoy it and I’m good at it. Unless she requests a recipe, I generally plan dinners myself, but if she suddenly went vegan, it would be up to her to take over the cooking or at least take responsibility for her own meals."
3,ati7b2,t2_15gjoi,argama87,NTA. Major lifestyle shifts should be at least discussed with your spouse. Simply deciding hey I'm doing this that way now simply never works. Vegetarian was one thing like you said and could be worked around. Vegan is another thing entirely and unfair to simply impose on the rest of the family. My wife would have told me good luck with that here's your chicken.
3,ati7b2,t2_2iqhdsr5,hungryhungry-hippos,"NTA. My husband was recently told by his doctor he needs to be on a restrictive diet. I'm an at home mom and pregnant so I cannot be on the same diet. We have very picky children (3M and 2F) so that means I had to start making 2 dinners. But about half the time I just made my kids what I knew they would eat and he figured out his own dinner. He also did his own lunch and breakfast most the time. I do the grocery shopping so I would buy what he asked for, but he is a big boy and knows I have enough on my plate with picky kids. So he didn't put pressure or force me to figure out his tricky meals on top. And that was doctors orders, not just something he felt called to or was interested in. "
3,ati7b2,t2_166oxw7x,HelpMeOuch,"NTA. I love when people preach that eating plants is so much better than eating meat because nothing had to die... I think they forget that plants are living creations as well, and the space that would be needed to farm for everyone to become vegan would be more destructive to our environment than humane animal farming would be. Your husband is being selfish, and should probably do proper research on the topic instead of single-sourcing his info. "
3,ati7b2,t2_2gmjuuaz,bcbudinto,"NTA. If he wants to go on this diet, he's more than welcome to do so. You're not stopping him and sound like you're supportive of his choices. If he's wanting to go on this diet but unwilling to prepare his own food then, he gets to eat what's made, not demand special treatment. Surely you wouldn't accept your children demanding individually tailored meals, so why should it be acceptable for him to do so? Also his ""you're supporting the murder industry"" comment is a red flag for me. That suggests to me that even if you did accommodate him with a separate meal you'd find yourself subject to the stereotypical vegan peanut gallery during meal times. Fuck. That. Vegans who demand accommodation but do not reciprocate that by at least shutting the fuck up about other people's right to eat what they want need to get hit by a bus IMO. "
3,ati7b2,t2_27cagmmv,Keowaii,"YTA (yes, he was TA too for yelling at you too). At least give it a go for him, rather than absolutely refusing. You're already making vegetarian food, all you have to do is swap out the dairy/egg with substitutes for him. Sit down with him and work out some ideas and budget. Trial it for a month or so and see how it goes. And your kids - if you're struggling to afford to buy specific food they want then you need to really put your foot down with them. They aren't babies and old enough to eat vegetables/fish/chicken and whatever it is mother is making. "
3,ati7b2,t2_l2oh3aj,half-sleep,"NTA. going vegan is a pretty big lifestyle change and if you do most/all of the cooking it's pretty dickish of him to expect you to just handle it - like, cool, it's his choice, but it affects you too! sounds like you guys need to hash some stuff out. "
3,ati7b2,t2_e1oyy,Floppycakes,"NTA. He's being totally unreasonable. That said, maybe you could offer to do a meatless meal once or twice a week, like a pasta or potato based meal. You could also do burrito bowls, where everyone can put together the ingredients as they like. That way, you could cook a meat and he just won't add it to his dish. While he shouldn't expect you to cater to his new preferences, and he certainly shouldn't be shoving in your face the fact that he supports you, this is marriage and marriage involves compromise. I think it would be reasonable to make meals that can work for him a couple of times per week, while giving him the choice to have a big lunch and skip dinner or cook for himself on the other days. He's a big boy, he can feed himself."
3,ati7b2,t2_2elr3rxr,FlippingPossum,"NTA. My parents have different dietary needs and often fix their own foods. I fix dinner. Don't like it? Fix something else. I do try to take preferences into account but one person doesn't dictate the meals. I like to have everyone look through cookbooks and pick something. I was a FT SAHM for 8 years. When my husband was home, he pitched in around the house. He typically got home early enough to cook some dinners. DH fixed his own breakfast and packed his own lunch. Why can't your husband research affordable vegan meals and prep his own meals? I'd have a real problem with someone forcing their beliefs on me. "
3,ati7b2,t2_184he00d,girlwhoweighted,"NTA He's a grown man, here can start crying his own tofu, and you are not a restaurant. And this bs about what's the point of him working etc etc... Baby-man would have to work even if he wasn't married. So he it's LUCKY that you are there to take care of the house and family while he takes his journey... a journey he is choosing to take without all of you. But side note... Of you start looking into premade vegan foods (like tofu-dogs) you may find that some accommodations can be made fairly easily and your kids might like the stuff... a lot of it is very well made these days and surprises a lot of meat eaters. Maybe suggest a compromise? Ask to try ONE vegan meal a week until you feel like you have some products and recipes under your belt. Work up from there. Maybe if he sees you are willing to try he will be willing to help as well."
3,ati7b2,t2_4e932,Loggerdon,"YTA - Your 'Lasagna with beef and cheese up the wazoo' is very bad for your kids health. Most American kids have the beginnings of heart disease by age 10. You are a SAHM for Christ sake. You should take your family's cooking as seriously as your former career. Kids palates will change. Why can't you make a pot of beans with veggies once a week and freeze it? How hard are big salads? You need to begin to eat LESS meat / shitty cheese, not more. You're the adult. I'm serious when I say that if my wife took your attitude I would leave her. Your husband has awakened to the fact that animal protein is unhealthy, not just for him but for everyone. You can't 'unclose that door'. He will become increasingly healthier and you will get increasingly fat and unhealthy. Don't be surprised when this thing escalates in two or three years and he leaves you. The diet your husband is suggesting is not 'radical'. It is the diet most consistent to that of our evolutionary history. That said, your husband should take the lead and help with food preparation. He could help prepare things and show you the easiest way to do things because, guaranteed, you don't know how to make a proper salad. "

If this was out of the blue I would understand the frustration, but it sounds like he has always been transitioning to this and you've just kind of ignored it hoping it would go away. He seems a little in the wrong with how he blew up, but with how dismissive you are being here I assume this was a long time coming. In fact it sounds like he assumed him earning more and you staying at home was going to be the thing that finally allowed him to go Vegan, sounds like you might have used that as an excuse. ""I would make you the food but we don't have the money and I just don't have the time"" ""I'm too stressed with work and the kids to try and join you in not eating meat"" ect. That's the vibe I get anyways."
3,ati7b2,t2_ztc9r,kittymctacoyo,NTA if he’s that set on it he can buy and prepare his own separate meals with money he gets from cutting back in his own areas.

3,ati7b2,t2_5s1ap,xaminmo,"NTA, you already work harder than he does, and you don’t get as much time off from work as he does. It sounds like he’s got some emotional/stress issues piling up, and may need to find someone to talk to about it. If he’s actually calling you names, and has not apologized, that needs to be addressed as a serious respect issue that can unravel your relationship. Things will change as the kids get older, but having TWO sets of food is a huge burden. Adding another because he’s changed his mind needs some accommodation from him.

I think he should also feel able to eat what he wants when he gets home.... then again, he can also cook his own meals, or learn some recipes for himself as well, work on a realistic budget or things that your kids can eat without choking down. But veganism can be super expensive too, so I still feel that as well. Four kids that don't even eat normally, makes it hard to get them to choke down things they definitely would not be used to."

My uncle has dietary restrictions because of medical reasons and I think it’s insane that my aunt cooks a meal for him, a meal for her and kiddo 1 AND THEN a seperate meal for kiddo 2 (this is purely because kiddo 2 gets whatever she wants and refuses to eat pretty much everything). The fact that he wants to go vegan is a big step up from being vegetarian. That’s a nightmare to factor in before you even start changing your recipes. He’s not being reasonable here at all. "

They need the calcium from milk (if they're not lactose intolerant) and the essential aminoacids from meat while they're on their growth spurt. Don't budge on it, or at very least go to a nutritionist and ask for their professional opinion of putting your kids on a vegan diet to shake your husband off you. Also ha on ""being the problem blindly supporting the meat industry"". Does he know where the veggie and fruit industry get their fertilizer from? All food industries are interwined unless you organically grow your own, whenever you like it or not. Sounds like he's just falling for a lot of propaganda."
3,ati7b2,t2_7ol5q,FatchRacall,"ESH, with the caveat that if I'm misreading the level of communication that occurred, either one of you could be the AH. He sucks for not talking this out and helping plan the vegan thing with you. He should have made the time to figure out how to deal with it. He shouldn't spring this on you. Vegan cooking is complicated. It's not hard, but it's very different. And if done right, it can be very, very cheap. If not done right, it will be awful, expensive, or both. It can be less expensive even than normal cooking. Also, to be fair, his attempts to follow some online bloggers about how veganism changed their lives is kinda... odd. Also, it sounds like he might be holding his income over your head. If that's true, that needs to stop. On the other hand, you used the term ""SAHM"". I have some... Issues with that. I know some people use it interchangeably with ""homemaker"", but it's really not. Your job isn't to be a mom any more than his job is to be a dad. You're a manager (biggest portion that a lot of non-homemakers or people who are 2 income households don't really understand), a cook, a maid, a nurse, an accountant, a chauffeur, handy-person, teacher, and a million other tasks. It's an exhausting job. But it's the one you chose to do. I'm sure you're aware of that. But part of your job is to make sure the single income winner (regardless of if it's the man, woman, or whatever) is as stress free as possible within reason. To make sure he can focus entirely on increasing his own income in whatever free time there is (whether this means self improvement, applying for other work, working late, or schmoozing with bosses about their new awesome vegan lifestyle). To make sure that most of the time he has with family is valuable. He's not allowed to see his kids, to see you, for the vast majority of his time. Try to make that time a positive experience. You're his support system. The reason you also suck is kinda complicated. You said your kids barely eat the food you make now. He also doesn't want to eat that food anymore. Maybe you should try a new menu. You say you'd be wasting an entire grocery trip on food ""you and the kids won't like"". What makes you say that? Have you tried making vegan food before and you hated it? Or are you just trusting what other people say? Have you made mistakes in the recipes? Some vegan food is admittedly awful (and any time someone tries to just use ""fake meat"" in place of real will likely fail), but spiced right and cooked right, it can be some of the best food out there. But yeah, this just sounds like a situation that should be handled and compromised on and, to be honest, it feels like he's compromising a lot more than you are right now, but he's also demanding things without talking them over first. Maybe you should talk to him about making an actual full vegetarian menu and asking him to drop the vegan thing, at least for now? Talk with him about it."
3,ati7b2,t2_1auk8jrt,VisualCelery,"NTA. He can't just decide he's gonna go on this strict, restrictive diet and expect you to cater to it. If he really wants to go vegan, he can make his own meals. It's not like you're suddenly ""not doing your job,"" you're still keeping the house clean, taking on most of the parenting duties, and feeding the kids. I mean, if you have time in the afternoon, you could compromise and get his vegan dinners started for him so he doesn't have to do as much prep (but again, that's only if you have time, it shouldn't take priority over all the other things a stay at home mom has to do every day), but you shouldn't be expected to either make vegan food for everyone, or make standard fare for everyone *and* special vegan dishes for him in addition. Either way, he needs to be the one figuring out what vegan meals he wants to eat - does he try all new things? Or does he take the foods he already likes and try to make them vegan? His decisions, his project. He can put the foods on a shopping list, or go to the grocery store himself to investigate options. Over time he might introduce new meals the rest of you might like, but again, it's his job to bring those foods into the home, not your job to figure out what will and won't work for everyone."

I wonder if he even realizes how much extra work that would be for you, even if your kids tried and liked the vegan dishes (they probably won't, they usually taste ""different"") I waited on a couple, who came to a steakhouse of all places, and announced they had just started a vegan diet. Vegetarian? They would have had plenty of options. Vegan? About 3. No mashed potatoes are not vegan, theres butter and whipping cream. The pasta dishes have butter in the sauce. Animal products in almost all of the dressings. They had salads with lemon, steamed veggies and baked potato with chives. They seemed so surprised that so many foods weren't vegan. They seemed disappointed that the bread wasnt vegan. I wonder if your husband is similar, if he understands how very restrictive and expensive a vegan diet is."

We do have our nights of rice, Mac and cheese, and meatless dishes. But you have to make sure that the kids eat as balanced as possible. Let him know once the kids are grown then it will be easier to transition built guilting you into doing it is wrong. For me that would make me dig my heels in. Vegan eating is an acquired taste. It can be done but it’s not an overnight switch. I know he wants to help the ecosystem, we all do. But it takes easing into it."

My Dad was vaguely like your husband in that he didn't seem to understand how much groceries cost to feed our family of 4-5, until my Mom made him do the monthly grocery shopping. He learned real quick to keep his mouth shut and special requests for fancy foods to a minimum (He was a big fan of those $13 fancy frozen cakes just because, not that it was a holiday or birthday or anything) Tell your husband that if he's so sure he wants this vegan diet for just himself, that he needs to sit down (or go to the store, whichever) and figure out just what the foods will cost and how exactly he expects you to work that into the budget while not starving your picky eaters."
3,ati7b2,t2_37wjmgqf,demonofgreed,"NTA - Although I can believe you he only supports things he believes in. I believe he believes this. Only problem is the dude seems kinda nuts lol. Tell him to chill. I mean you could maybe try doing it but although every vegan will claim to the contrary, it's cheap being vegan on paper but in practice it's a whole lot of work that frankly he could be doing himself if he's so invested in it. He pays the bills and you hold down the house, I get that. But you don't bust into his office telling him how to do his job. What right does he have to tell you how to do yours? Tell him to eat what you make or make it himself. He's free to pick out any meat or cheese if he wants. Or just phone it in and make him a salad every day until he changes his mind on the vegan thing. "
3,ati7b2,t2_6u8h2,yesssi,"NTA - Are you at all concerned about his behaviour? The odd accusation about you blindly supporting the meat industry kind of weirds me out, especially considering he ate dairy until recently and meat until a year ago. Is this out of character? (I mean, I can't picture my husband talking to me that way, but maybe your partner has always been a bit of a drama queen?) While I don't find his choice to be vegan odd, I do find the conversation/accusatory nature of his words odd. I'm just thinking perhaps the issue isn't as simple as it seems, if this is out of character."
3,ati7b2,t2_cxmhejk,SpaceAgeHamburger,"NTA. You've got a lot on your plate (haha), and plenty of picky eaters without your husband demanding you accommodate his new diet. I think there's a middle-ground to be found where you can have a meaty/vegetarian main course and some vegan sides, and he can pitch in for his own main course (Tell him to make a big batch on the weekend!). And I do want you to know that there is delicious vegan food (I'm an omnivore, but we cook from the ""Veganomicon"" occasionally, and it's great). But at the end of the day, it's on him to either gently persuade the whole fam to follow him on his food journey, or fend for himself."
3,ati7b2,t2_npcu11l,mathxjunkii,"NTA 1. You have a job. It’s called being a mother. So he can just get off his high horse about “what’s the point of me going to work blah blah blah”. The point of him going to work is so that there is a household monetary income which is necessary for you to do your job which is arguably more stressful and has longer hours and now apparently means catering to your husband who wants to eat only rabbit food. 2. Is he aware that he’s a parent? And that the food in the house has to feed children? Children don’t need eat weird vegan things that have been discovered on a “food journey”. In fact, the only “food journey” children take is when mom turns her back for 2 seconds and they eat the McNugget they just dropped on the floor. You’re not about to serve them roasted beet root and ginger butter. Not gonna happen. They will not eat that. They won’t even look at that. They will starve. And I imagine he enjoys the existence of the children, yes? So really, Veganism is counterproductive until they’re all off at college. "

I'm assuming it wasn't only your idea and it's mostly to save money. 2) you're putting in a lot of work. 4 kids is not at all the same as staying home and drinking wine while watching trash tv 3) how dare he talk to you like that? You're not forcing him to do a complete lifestyle change. He decided that on his own.
3,ati7b2,t2_51y8so7,yyy_guy,NTA. marriage should be filled with compromise. maybe you could try to leave the meat and cheese out one night per week? he can pick around the animal product bits the other nights? (this is close to the ratio of vegans to no 1:5n vegans in the house) or he could also compromise by earning more money so you could eat out and he choose vegan items off the menu ;-)
3,ati7b2,t2_16cxlp,sloth_hug,"YTA. You outright said you aren't even willing to try. A vegan diet is both healthier and cheaper. Of course, the ""fake meat"" substitutes are expensive, but you don't need them. Yes, you would have to learn some more recipes, but why is that a bad thing? Use Google and you'll find many. If your children absolutely must have meat (they don't), you can add it to the vegan meal for them. You aren't his slave, no, but to expect him to work all day, come home, care for the kids, do household chores (all normal expectations) AND cook for himself, while you're home all day, is ridiculous. You can cook for the family! Now, he should absolutely be on board with helping you discover and make these new recipes, but YTA for not even wanting to try. And the picky eaters? You're the parents. Let them go hungry if they refuse to eat. You're in charge, not them. Quite frankly, you aren't supportive of him. It's not feasible for him to make his own separate meals, as you've already said the budget is tight. If you aren't willing to at least try, he has no real way of going vegan. Since food is such a large part of life, you not trying to compromise will likely cause a rift in your relationship."
3,ati7b2,t2_1y57yifl,Occamello,"NTA It's not your job to cook for him, if he wants to make a lifestyle choice that's his decision, he shouldn't force the fallout of his decision on you.

All I can say is I wish you luck, and hope he will either come to his senses or you may lose him to the cult. Not all vegans are this way, the meat police brigade,but because of his flip out, he shows me that he has a need for control, much like religious folks. If you don't join him you are just part of the problem, is basically what he said to you. That's garbage. He wants a special diet, he should handle it. You are not his paid culinary expert. Anyone with a special diet should be working on it and cooking for it on their own, if the majority of the home isn't on it, that is not your problem. Be prepared for it to get worse before it gets better. He doesn't seem the kind of vegan that follows "" you eat what you guys eat, and I will eat what I eat, no problems"". Love me some vegan cultists."
3,ati7b2,t2_2sltig54,chooch57,"NTA. You have 4 other people to consider. If he wants to try vegan, then he can research the recipes he wants to try & cook them himself! You’re not obligated to take on the dietary choices he makes for himself. You & your children can eat what they find appetizing. I would say if he’s adamant, there are delicious vegan recipes out there you might be willing to try. Also should note, a vegan diet is not cruelty free. Tell him to research the wages, lifestyles, & workers rights of the immigrant workers who pick all of our fruits & vegetables in this country & ask if that’s cruel or not. The meat industry sucks, yes, but he’s blind with privilege when it comes to thinking that him going vegan is some humanitarian lifestyle change. It’s not."
3,ati7b2,t2_30yty8hu,MsFortune1970,"NTA, you are his wife and partner, not his mother and not his damn slave. If he doesn't want to eat what you cook for the entire family, then maybe he should make his own food. It's a whole different way of cooking to start with. Perhaps you can try to accomadate him - within reason - and within your food budget. If you have a crockpot, maybe once a week make up batches of vegan vegetable soup or Lentils and/or bean soup. (usually under $2 for dried and another $3 for vegetable broth) divide into individual servings and freeze them and keep a couple vegan staples around for his lunches. I wish you luck. "

3,ati7b2,t2_2krlgsu2,Ebox3rchamp,"NTA it is ridiculous for him to take his views and try to make them the whole families. It’s good you are supportive and you could make sure that he has some vegetarian dishes that are prepped ahead and maybe ready in the fridge. Maybe he is upset deep down that he comes home and has to fix himself a vegetarian dish? Sounds like some more talking is needed, but for him to expect all of you to go vegetarian he is definitely in the wrong. If you took up yoga, or weightlifting and told him about all the benefits would he like it if you said the whole family is going to do it, including him. That would not fly. "
3,ati7b2,t2_1okfn27b,quinarian,"Going against the grain; YTA. So your husband is the breadwinner, and hey, I'm not implying your contributions as a SAHM are less than. But as the female of a couple where Dad stays home and Mum goes to work, I'd be a bit disappointed in my hubs if he decided to die on this kind of hill. I know he does a great deal to support our home and family, but that's his job, he's not doing it for fun or charity. I don't put everything on him (I handle laundry, bills and appointments and such), but if I were to request he make a change to his workload in this regard, and he told me to take a hike because he already does everything, I'd be very disappointed that my own contributions to the home meant so little to him that we couldn't even work out a compromise that works for us both."

You can pick up what he needs at the store but you can't take on the extra mental work at the moment. Also, you can try to introduce new food over time but it's going to take a while to get the family to eat one thing. "
3,ati7b2,t2_7o6bf,UHElle,"Probably unpopular opinion here, but YTA. But honestly, as a person who eats strictly vegan at home (and mostly vegan, sometimes vegetarian outside the home), I actually lol’d at your ridiculous excuse of not being able to give up meat because your “signature dish” is lasagna. I make vegan lasagna with meat sub crumbles and vegan cheeses ‘up the wahoo’ every couple months (not regularly, because even vegan it’s still stupidly calorie dense). It *can* be done, *very* easily, it’s just a matter of whether you even want to try. The earlier you expose your children to different cuisine with expectations of them eating it, the larger palette they’ll have in life. At least *adding* some mock meats or legumes as the center of your meals into your diet or cooking base meals that your husband can add his vegan protein of choice to when he gets home is not unreasonable (as others have said), but to say you *can’t* and essentially won’t because your children won’t eat it (both of you are the adults and in control; perhaps reassert that to your children in a reasonable manner?) and because your “signature dish” contains animal products is utterly ludicrous. And while you haven’t specified that the issue is dinner, it really seems like that’s the most likely offender, because he could take the previous evening’s dinner for lunch the next day, while fending for himself on the weekend. All of this is to say, you’re talking about making ONE out of THREE meals a day vegan. Do the earth, your children and your bodies’, and animals everywhere a favor and just make 1 meal a day vegan, ffs. If you need a place to start, try youtube for quick and dirty vegan recipes. My personal fave is Sarah’s Vegan Kitchen, while Cheap Lazy Vegan does a lot of, you guessed it, cheap and/or lazy stuff. I find Caitlin Shoemaker sort of insufferable, but she also does some good one pot and/or easy stuff. "
3,ati7b2,t2_37kjnhzn,ElaiosAdonaios,"YTA Vegan food is just like non-vegan food, and it's usually cheaper. Learn some new recipes. It's easy. Honestly it would do you and your children a lot of good to not be eating ""lasagna with beef and cheese up the wahoo"" every night. Even non-vegans should be eating some vegan meals just by accident, because diets crammed full of animal products are really unhealthy. The fact that you see it as such a huge transition tells me that you're eating a really bad diet. You should want your children to eat healthier, because how kids eat in childhood goes a long way to determining how they eat later in life."
3,ati7b2,t2_391jegvg,mira_lolo,NTA Normally SAHMs are just super lazy and feel they shouldnt have to cook and clean at all but thats super extreme to just throw at you. Thats not even a simple request. Veganism is extremely expensive and not the easiest to cook. And he's not even taking into consideration about the kids nutrition if they dont take to it.

3,a94tln,t2_2mpfcq6a,LadyCass79,"NTA Gift giving is a complex social ritual. Yes, people on a basic level like to gift people they love. However, when the people who give us gifts give us bad gifts it underscores feelings that they either really don't know enough about us to know what we like. Or worse, they don't care to find out. It sounds like you are being gracious (and you should be), but that still feels icky. Gifts can also be a form of social power when they are given to create a sense of obligation or gratitude. A couple of options. 1. Continue suffering in silence and resenting this. 2. Let it go. Nothing changes here other than you tell yourself that your only gift will be the Knowledge that they cared enough to get you something. 3. Institute a gift list expectation for everyone. You can market this a it being easier for you. AMAZON wish lists are great because as each person shops it takes the item off the list. You can even remove items if you buy them elsewhere. This improved my extended family Christmas 10 fold. 4 Confront them.

There is nothing wrong with having a child and giving them up to an open (or not open) adoption. It's actually quite a nice thing to do, since your providing the child with the best life. But then she wants to have the child on her wedding with semi important role. Without telling family about the child's existence (and how can you explain to your family who the child is without telling truth - the child will probably tell herself!). And now... She contacts said family via tinder? It's going to be one of the craziest thing I said in quite a long time, but: Are you sure it's her family? Because not a single sane contacts their family via tinder. (Edit: Maybe one of them is the baby daddy and would pissed if he would learn she gave up their child to adoption without telling him? Everything is posibble. If you're not fake, bc your situation is highly unbelievable considering this post and the post about the baby are only 2hrs apart). I mean I can see it as a funny situation, you swipe right and left and suddenly you see your sister, best friend or someone like this and you swipe right just for funnziest. And then they swipe right and you messege the other one with a bunch of emojis or some funny line. But like... Having tinder just for contacting family? No, sir, no-o. Not to mention quite unbelievable since you have to swipe through a lot of people before and expose yourself to a lot of pick up lines and inappropriate photos. Sure, you could just swipe left on everyone except you family, but... a) I believe they ban you after too many left swipes in a row b) its beyond weird.

3,aahkj8,t2_8s7a3,Player_Slayer_7,"NTA. To be honest, it sounds like it was an emergency for you since it was a heavy day for you. If yu have to wait, that kid has to wait.

3,aahkj8,t2_jzm7grl,Rainishername,"No One could have known it was an emergency for you, too. They really shouldn’t be dicks about that. Plus it’s going to happen a lot with kids that small that they hold it too long before actually getting up to find a restroom. Kids don’t learn to go when they need to until a bit later. That’s going to happen a lot to that kid where it’s urgent until they learn how to read what they feel before it’s GO time. I think if someone didn’t have to poop that second or piss that second or bleed out that moment, it’s their choice to let someone go first. I do now and then. But you needed the bathroom. Simple as that. Pretty sure men don’t even have any understanding of how vital a lot of the crap we need to do in the bathroom is. They make fun of us for “making them pull over to find bathrooms” because they refuse to grasp that we have real beds and we aren’t just complaining to complain or have no self control or whatever. If that employee thought you were rude then, he’d have thought you’d have been even ruder if you’d have taken out your period product right then and there and left it on the floor for him to clean. That’s why people need to use the restroom and why you don’t have to explain or justify to anyone why you need to go. This isn’t fucking elementary school. You don’t need shit for permission. "

The father didn't get a chance to ask. Or apologize. I'm not saying you have to give up everything for kids, but they're still learning. Our self-awareness has a finer tuning, but adults are still learning, too. So, no worries. Some things take practice. I realized once that there are ""a million ways to communicate"" a thing. After I handled a situation poorly, I wouldn't remember ""a million ways to communicate"" until a couple days after the fact. I'd lightly kick myself. Eventually, it was one day, then hours, etc. Until, finally, I can remind myself in the midst of testy situations that I can choose how to communicate this thing, and it doesn't have to be jerkish. It's still not perfect. But, hey. I'm trying. Anyway, I'm pretty sure all dogs go to heaven. There was even a movie about it."
3,aahkj8,t2_c0ct5rc,XWitchyGirlX,"NTA. The kid needs to learn manners.

I fucking hate people that do that shit (cutting in line like that or going into somewhere/using something that you are literally just about to use/go into). I have motherly instincts so if the kid asked nicely I probably would’ve let them in unless it was an emergency on my end, but theres no way Im gonna just let them cut in front of me. If they did, Id be bitching out the parent letting them know they need to teach their kid some respect"
3,aahkj8,t2_gancp,AtticusFrenchToast,"NTA mostly, for the reasons others have said. But the fact that you claim you would have let him go if he'd been polite about it casts serious doubt on your claim that you were very worried about blood on your pants. Polite asking isn't more indicative of it being a super-emergency for the kid than trying to squeeze ahead—in fact, the opposite. And on your end, him being polite doesn't change your chances of bleeding through. So I think you're either exaggerating how worried you were about your pants in order to justify your decision, or overstating how much you think the kid earned his denial by being rude. In that way, you're a little bit TA for how you wrote the post, but you're NTA for going in the bathroom first."
3,aahkj8,t2_mp7jo,syscallgrl,"ESH or No assholes here. Somewhere between thise. I don't think you were the asshole per se. However, as a woman who also has extremely heavy periods, I do not think that a few minutes of letting the child go in front of you was going to cause you to bleed onto your clothes. I get the urgency, but saying that a few more minutes is an emergency is an exaggeration on your part. Did waiting a few more minutes for the child possibly mean him/her wetting his pants? Yes. Kids really do need to go when they need to go. Was it your responsibility to know this? (I assume from your post that you were a younger childless woman at this time, just an assumption) No. If he was in danger of having an ""accident"" on the plane where he would wet his pants and have to wait until landing or possibly home to change his clothes, then the parent should have told you. That's call parenting. Should the flight attendant have rudely scolded you? Absolutely not. I agree with others it sounds like he was just having a shit time and then had to deal with the mess and was upset about it. So, definite room for improvement for all parties in this scenario. You weren't *wrong*, but I don't think you were completely *right* either. If a redo could be done, maybe tell the kid no, like you did, then ask Dad - hey I have been waiting quite a while, can this wait or do you think he will pee his pants? If he said yes, then it might have been nicer to wait. If he said no, then he wouldn't have complained. I would be careful about coming to Reddit for advice and answers when kids are involved. The average age of Reddit users is 20-something (I can't remember which thread that was in, perhaps datai beautiful). Anyway, the users tend to be very anti-children as most of them have not had a child or simply do not plan to have children. So take these answers with a grain of salt. Including mine :). So maybe NTA but room for improvement??"
3,aahkj8,t2_10xyw5w,RareRino,"I can see why the flight attendant though you were an ass, and if you just needed to pee I'd say that YTA, since kids that young can't ""hold it in"" very well and it's either go now or soiling themselves, but since you were on a heavy day, NTA."
3,aahkj8,t2_f3jwk,Azmodien,"As a dad of a 4-5 year old, YTA, if you weren't in danger of pissing yourself right there just let the kid go for 30 seconds....kids that age really can't hold it very long sometimes and making a kid have an accident because it wasn't ""fair"" he cut in front of you is a bit assholeish...but I'm sure everyone will say NTA like usual here."
3,aahkj8,t2_t2lah,DisMaTA,"YTA but I'm right there with you. Little kids don't feel it in advance, they get the pee signal really late, when it's super urgent already. But daddy could've asked. Even just shouting ""sorry, please let us skip"" would have been acceptable IHMO. The kid trying to sqeeze by you is a nono, too. Again, too small to really know better but there should be some hesitation to touch strangers. Nobody taught him that's not okay. So, YTA because his was more urgent than yours but I would've done the same thing to teach a lesson both kid and daddy. Better they clean up than me. Also you could have taken care of your pad earlier, too. So, meh. But the flught assistant takes the cake. To scold someone ""that was very rude"" is condescending and ironically rude. Why would they assume that there was no emergency on your part? Are airplane toilets so desirable that one would want to use one if they had any other choice? "

3,aahkj8,t2_4jkl8,Zohso,"YTA. Kids don’t live by our rules. As such, “holding it” and “just be patient” are not part of their vocabulary. Not to mention sometimes the parent needs to react quickly to what’s going on as they have multiple things to juggle and getting a kid in and out of a restroom quickly is paramount. Now, I’m a parent and can understand this plainly. I’m also a “mind your own business” kinda person. So I would never be that parent to impose on anyone else unless it was a total emergency. And also, I would never be angry or feel ill towards someone who denied my request. Having said all that, it’s not that you SHOULD give it up. It’s just the kind thing to do. I for instance always offer my seat to older women. Or men for that matter. Or pregnant women. I always offer the person in line to go ahead if I’ve got more than than at the grocery. And I even let people go ahead of me at the restroom when it’s me and my kids IF I know it’s not an emergency solely because I know it can take us a little longer to do things. It’s all about being kind and not necessarily about being correct. So, were you correct at this moment, yes. You were there first, it’s yours. But nevertheless YTA. "

Don't want to talk to them? You don't have to. Wait it out, sit next to your friend and go home with her, those other people would have dropped off at some point on your way to her house and even if she invited a few of them over its not her fault if your change your mind and want to bail. Just say something. &#x200B; I had a best friend when I was young, we were friends for a long time and it was almost always just the two of us. I made a new friend and she was jealous, refused to get to know her or hang out if the new girl was there. She even went as far as telling me that I shouldn't be hanging out with new girl because SHE was my best friend not her. You know what happens to people who get jealous, try to horde their friend and refuse to participate if its not 100% their way? They lose a friend. I hated to cut my best friend out of my life as I really liked her but I didn't have many friends and her telling me I couldn't have another friendship was the breaking point. I get that your situation isn't like this yet so don't let it get there. Be a good friend, if you don't like hanging in groups and she does pull her aside and say that sometimes you want it to just be the two of you. That doesn't mean you can only show up for alone BFF time and not group friend time. Its a compromise, show her you care and want to be her friend instead of slinking into the background (or ditching ffs) every time another person joins in."

I’ve seen you’ve commented about her having scheduling concerns— suggest something like Uber or online medical transcription or something?

Today's economy isn't really built for ""one provider"" families unless you've moved up a lot in companies, or have a higher paid position (a lot of times requiring some type of advanced degree, but not always). It's unreasonable to say to someone who is working that they need to push for a higher salary if that person isn't willing to chip in, too, especially since it's currently easier to find a job than move up in many cases. Unless there's some reason that she would struggle at a job (""I don't want to"" isn't a valid reason), it's not unreasonable to ask that she help row the boat. Is her family fairly traditional? One of my uncles married a Southern (US) girl and she expected him to take on a part time job in addition to his full- time so she wouldn't need to work. "

I'm not exactly sure why your mother gets a say in a house she contributes nothing towards, but I would suggest if she's so altruistic she can take over the mortgage etc. for the full remaining amount from your father leaving him in the clear. If not, then they can move into something they can afford, perhaps she can move in with them to help out. But all that depends on how much control your father has given you over the house.

3,b2j231,t2_32r4v01w,tenlin1,"YTA - In high school, I used to have a teacher who would give 5 bonus points on Monday if you turned in the homework then, 4 if you turned it on Tuesday, and so on and so on. It gave incentives to kids who got things done fast (not me), but also didn't punish kids who still did well and knew their limits when it came to procrastinating (me). If you turned things in late, so long as it was a high quality, she wouldn't take points off either. The thing is, while everyone in the class thought it was a nice favor, there was one little prick who thought it wasn't good enough, and demanded more if she turned in the homework the same day she assigned it, and started asking other teachers for the same treatment. Long story short, by the end of the year, the teacher had stopped offering any bonus points for kids who turned things in early, and kids who were late and did well had to start getting punished. When you do this, you limit the chances that the professor will repeat the same thing in the future, because suddenly the person who feels entitled to better treatment pipes up, and makes a fuss. I know that this was just an email, and you certainly weren't as extreme as the prick from my high school, but with the way colleges work, you're likely not the only one frustrated with this. The professor might get worried that someone will tell the dean, and again, with the way some colleges are, he might get reprimanded for it. He won't be able to extend the deadline even for events like this where it's near impossible to get the project done by the deadline, all because you felt entitled to bonus points since you somehow got it done. If you want to feel good about yourself, turn in the dang essay on time anyway. Find some comfort in the professor seeing that you got it done anyway. Maybe he would've given you bonus points just because you did it without making a point about it. But you didn't. "

3,b5u7l6,t2_dkkce,poltyy,"NTA My best childhood friend was getting married, but wouldn’t tell anyone, including me, for whatever reason (an unplanned pregnancy was involved, her mom told my mom who told me). I got an invite for another wedding, in a far away state. I called her and asked about that wedding, said I was going to commit to it as my husband was a groomsman. But if she had any qualms that I had to know now. She pretended like she wasn’t getting married. I committed to travel, hotel, etc to the other wedding. ONE month prior she announces her wedding is that same day, asks me to be a bridesmaid. I said no. She never really forgave me. But she KNEW that was the date for 3 months. I gave her every opportunity. In hindsight, now that I’m older I wish I would have gone though. Unplanned pregnancy in your 20s was a big deal and a wedding was a big deal and she was probably confused, stressed, and not thinking clearly. I should have been there for her. "

I'm still frustrated about it so for you to have this trip so planned out and for her to be aware, I can't even imagine how much more frustrating this must be for you. If I had any excuse to not have been at my brother's wedding I would have told him it was too far away with too little notice. Someone else's lack of planning should not be your stress.

Wedding etiquette states that save the dates should be sent 8 to 12 months in advance (or at least 4 months in advance if everyone is local) and invitations should be sent approximately 8 weeks in advance.

If I was your friend I’d definately appreciate that, but then again I wouldn’t give people only a months notice for my wedding then get upset that people have lives and couldn’t make it. Especially not my best friend. She might just be in her feelings as well. Maybe in time she’ll realize her error and come around and at least acknowledge it, but it’d be better if there was an apology. From what little I know, I think she might just caught be caught up in her emotions, especially since 30 of 50 invited can’t make it. Her close friends not being able to make it might have been the sprinkles on her homemade shit sunday. "

I'm assuming it's neutered. Has there been anything change in the house, new pet, new baby, change of working patterns, DIY? You can buy a feliway diffuser to calm cats down and also getting them stoned on catnip helps too. Have you changed cat litter or using one that's scented. I'd recommend a natural paper based one for a while to see if it makes a difference, don't use soap to wash the tray out just boiling water and a brush, they don't like the smell of soap. I'm hoping it's not declawed, if it is its probably the pain in its paws making it hurt to dig in the litter. Make Shute it's food and water is nowhere near and its cleaned after every poop and changed every couple of days completely Don't clean with anything ammonia based like bleach etc, it smells of pee to a cat and theyll Mark their territory. If it's soft furnishings like a sofa you won't get rid of the smell completely without taking the whole cushion apart, washing the cover and replacing the foam. Honestly cats can smell a speck of pee in an entire carpet. Use a black light on your stuff, pee glows, you'll see if youve missed anything. Last resort make furniture off limits. Get a small plant mister on the gentlest setting and squirt near it every time it jumps on the furniture.

It sounds to me like your friend is *deeply* insecure. Possibly even measures her worth by how many men want her. Her defensive and aggressive attack against you shows this. Likely, she was hoping to berate you into leaving her alone on this topic because of how uncomfortable your clear communication made her as she knows she is in the wrong. Now, she did appologize for being a bitch. This is a really good sign that you, unfortunately, ignored. That's the main reason I'm voting the way I am. If she can realize she was put of line, genuinely feel remorse, and change (that last bit is *key*), then you've thrown away a friend in need of support to change and be someone not gross to be around. Wrapping back around to my initial statement, if you can't forgive or trust her, if it causes too much strain on you, cut it off. Your own mental health is always more important than others."

Again, I’m a ***salesperson.*** I’m probably the last person they want to talk to. There is another strong possibility -> the husband is asking the secretary to gatekeep. That way she’s the bad guy and he isn’t. That may also be the reason why he hasn’t taken action on this issue yet. That may sound crazy, but for me, it would be tough for me to have lunch with my wife. It would snap me out of the work mindset and it would be tough to get it going again. Also, my wife likes to talk, so a 30 minute lunch could easily morph into an hour or more. It’s just not worth it to me. I’d rather see her in the evenings when I can devote my full attention to her. The more I’ve written here, the more I think that’s what it really is. Edit - if he’s having her gatekeep, it may also explain her behavior. She sees the husband creating a barrier and she’s taking that as a license to flirt with him. "

The first step should be to talk to her yourself, or get your husband to talk to her. Or just work around her petty bullshit, or put up with it. I don't think it's necessarily fair grounds to fire someone, and it's probably more hassle than your husband needs. So, for something that's more of an annoyance than a serious problem, I don't think it's worth getting sucked into or creating headaches for."

As a former receptionist/front desk person/admin assistant I can almost guarantee if the husband isn't angry and dealing with this that he's actually asked the secretary to gatekeep. I had a boss (woman) who would routinely tell me if her husband called to tell him she was busy and that she would see him when she got home. Or if I did take a message it would be left in the same place I set it for hours or in the trash then if he showed up she would say she didn't get the message that I directly gave her. He's at work to WORK, not hang with his bored housewife. And from the secretary's POV I would be pissy too if someone kept calling or dropping by all the time putting me in the middle. She knows and has to keep a pleasant working relationship with him and if he hasn't reprimanded her for this he likely condones it. And just because she's nicer to him doesn't mean she's trying to steel your friends husband, being familiar isn't automatically flirting, its usually just a way to cope through your job especially in an office of 3 people. Who else is she going to be friendly with?"

It probably interrupts his focus but because of the awkward position you’ve put him in by whining about his secretary, he’s probably too afraid to tell you that. An approach to take would be to let him take the lead and give him a chance to ask you to come by for lunch. If you can’t that day, there’s always another one. You think you’re being a good wife but I’m sorry to say it’s the opposite. He married you, relax and give him some room. Don’t give him a reason to complain about you to his secretary..."

Frankly, it sounds like he's having her be a firewall for unwanted contact and, because she's acting as asked, it's being misconstrued as her wanting him. > He sucks for not being honest > Wife sucks for trying to cost a woman her job, likely for doing what she's told > Secretary likely isn't an asshole"

3,ai9yw5,t2_10m96b,TavoreParan,"YTA I suspect that the husband doesn't want to have so many lunch dates with his wife. The fact that he has requested wife to go through secretary vs using his personal phone (and checking it more often, that isn't super difficult if you are the boss) indicates that wife is probably likely to contact him too frequently while he is trying to work without that setup. Why can't she tell him before he leaves that she wants to bring him lunch? Why can't they have regular lunch dates at specific times on certain days of the week? Or if he actually enjoys the surprise factor, an agreement that she message him at X time to check in if she wants to do lunch and he check phone around said time? "
3,ai9yw5,t2_27r2ssi5,Boredread,"Yta. She’s doing her job, which is to protect his time/schedule for work. Maybe your lunches run long. He probably has a lot of work lunches. Tbh i think your husband told her to cut you off with these work lunches bc he has actual work to do and doesn’t want to respond to your messages himself. Why don’t you text your husband yourself to tell him not to eat lunch? But i honestly think your husband is just letting her take the fall for this so you guys don’t fight and you can’t fire her.

It's completely inappropriate that she's treating you like a business associate (hell, she wouldn't be this rude to a business associate...she's treating you like an intruder and it's wildly unprofessional) when you're trying to speak to your own damn husband. She's got no right to be the gatekeeper there, and I think you need to sit your husband down and let him know exactly how much this is upsetting you. He needs to start prioritizing your comfort over his secretary's comfort and have a serious talk with her about how she is expected to treat people."

3,a9yfco,t2_keqi2,book-reading-hippie,"SHP / YTA You say she puts her feet up when she wears shorts or jeans? So it is something she does regularly then even when you cannot see her underwear? If this is how she normally sits, she may not realize on the days she wears skirts that she is flashing you. You're an adult, her teacher, you could have just asked her to put her feet down, and if pressed why, just say her outfit is inappropriate when sitting that way.

What school allows kids to put their feet up on desks? Sounds more like you need to have better control over your classroom instead of trying to be the ""cool"" teacher. 3. You should have said something the first time it happened and since you let it slide she could come back and say well she did it the other day and you didn't say anything so you must have enjoyed the view. 4.

Obviously she was already aware her underwear was showing, since teenagers are not idiots. She was probably doing it on purpose for her own reasons but it’s weird to know your teacher is looking/commenting on it. This can’t possibly be the only distracting thing a kid has done with their outfits. What about girls with their tits out or crop tops or tight jeans, or boys with their boxers showing? If you’re working with kids you probably need to learn to ignore the dumb shit they wear and you DEFINITELY need to put more thought into how you respond to it. "
3,a9yfco,t2_jak4q,yildizli_gece,"NTA, of course--teachers should be able to tell their students how to behave more respectfully and what-not--but at this point I'd suggest doing a couple things: One, explain this to your boss b/c now this student's made it an issue with her friends, and that can't get better without you having some backing from your employer. Two, in concert with that, consider having an *actual* conversation with her and her parents, and explain your expectations about classroom behavior and your effort to not embarrass her leading you to the note. And then *three*, for the love of Pete *don't* care so much about trying not to embarrass kids! They need it! I'm not suggesting you say anything out loud to her in front of students, but towards the end of class--with the door open and students still filing out--you should be able to publicly say, ""John, see me a minute"" or ""Sarah, I need to speak with you"", and then *quickly* tell them, ""I need you to stop doing X in class"". If other students overhear it, fine; you're not trying to make it a secret or some salacious story, so out with it. "
3,a9yfco,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"NTA, but you do realize she could have taken that note to the office and ""this teacher passed me this and has been making me uncomfortable and staring at my underwear!!!!""

I remember this girl back in high school (early 90’s) when I was a student and she’d wear these tight leggings like every single day, yeah looked good but she made my study hall teacher very uncomfortable cause the damn girl couldn’t stay in her seat. She’d come up to his desk and be silly, dropping pens, clapping erasers and all of which involved bending down or splitting her legs, pulling her leggings tighter making it ride her ass and front.

That way, if an idea backfires or actions are questioned, you have people to back you up, but you also get options on handling a situation without going at it alone. Is there no dress code at your school? As an older male, I think in this situation, I would be best to get a woman you work with involved. "
3,a9yfco,t2_2r0us721,dreamyj7,"NTA Anyone who thinks that someone should just ignore someone else continuously exposing their undergarments to them while trying to do their job, is TA.

YTA to yourself if you don’t go and speak with your superiors with how you handled the situation, just to make them aware. It could look really bad for you if she goes to them first. In the future, get a female teacher to speak to her with you or speak to her alone. After letting your superiors know first. "
3,a9yfco,t2_10ii0mv3,glory_of_dawn,"NTA, but you may have inadvertantly opened a nasty can of worms here, depending on how the student reacts in the coming days. I really want to impress upon you that there is nothing inherently wrong with what you did, but the mere act of mentioning it can be bad if she suddenly decides you were sexually harassing her. My high school had a law suit about ten years back because a male teacher told a female student that her clothes were in violation of the dress code. The student came back the next day and informed the school that she'd be suing for sexual harassment. They ended up settling out of court because they had to pay out less money and the teacher would be protected from being listed as a sex offender, but the unofficial school policy is now that male teachers do not comment on dress code violations by female students and instead need to inform a female coworker to address the issue. I hope your student isn't that insane, but in the future, I would do what you could to avoid similar situations entirely, just in case. "

I spent a year trying to get him to sober up and when he finally did, he was changed completely. The bad behavior didn't stop, if anything it got worse because he was no longer living with the guilt and shame of his double life. I finally left him six months after he sobered up because I realized that he was just a terrible person, with or without the drugs. Really though, stay away from other addicts.

3,aiyqm9,t2_1s39jdcg,navajohcc,"NAH. I was in this exact situation with an ex-boyfriend. He was introverted and needed his space, and I couldn’t understand that for a long time, and it led to fights and tension just as you described, because he constantly felt claustrophobic and highly strung and I constantly took it personally. I was always at his place and eventually we broke up because we were constantly fighting, but we stayed friends and I realised just how important space was for our relationship. You are never the asshole for needing your personal space, but if she’s anything like I was it can be really hard to tell her that without her getting upset and taking it personally. You need to lay down some boundaries and stick to them, for instance spending the weekend together, but she goes home on Monday. After she leaves, make sure she understands you’re not trying to get rid of her, maybe send her good morning texts, or Skype her until she falls asleep or something like that. Show her how giving you your space leads to positive things in your relationship and fewer fights. Back up your reasoning with the fact that you literally can’t afford to have someone living in your apartment 24/7 because of the heating costs. If she can’t stick to your boundaries, you might have to take a break from the relationship, because it can really wear away at your mental health if someone can’t respect your space, and you shouldn’t have to go through that. I hope this helps you moving forward and good luck with the relationship! "

I am friends with two of my exes and I cherish those friendships and the occasional meet up for a beer. This works because I am very clear that I don‘t see them as romantic partners anymore and they don‘t see me as such either. And from your description it seems like you went through a very slow and careful breakup and it‘s totally ok to be friends after this. I personally wouldn‘t be understanding if I was forced to leave a dnd group because my SO has issues with me seeing my ex occasionally-I‘d rather have an honest talk and move on. For me, If you‘re in a romantic relationship, those feelings are built on feelings of friendship, so while the romantic love might go away, if the breakup wasn‘t ugly, there can still be feelings of a friendship remaining.

You’re probably embellishing a lot of what she did and said, and it clearly looks like a common case of her baiting you for money. The instant block on instagram makes it more obvious. Btw, “triangulating her” on social media is creepy. It’s cyber-stalking. "

DO NOT do this. you already went waaay too far by finding her on instagram. she blocked you cause it was creepy for you to do what you did. going back will just make you a full blown creep and come off stalkerish. let it go and actually deal with your breakup. you aren't ready to be doing anything with anyone if a single make out session made you think any of this is/was a good idea or that she was interested in you. "
3,atvndx,t2_izrl,Aerik,"definitely became the asshole with the cyberstalking. no doubt about it. and asking to see her after hours. and specifically requesting her. dude, she's paid to be nice to you. The entire point of her specific employment is that you pay her a lot to be really nice to you. you are NOT entitled to her time, in or out of the club. --- and your friends are also assholes. She's not ""messing with you."" At all. She's just doing her fucking job. She is not tricking anybody. You wanted to be treated nice with sexual contact. you paid for it. You got it. end of transaction, buddy. It's not a conspiracy by some ""slut"" to rob you or anything. Your friends need to get over themselves.

3,atvndx,t2_ulnz4,shhh_its_me,"YTA for continuing down this path. OK I can see why you believed her when she said ""I'll meet you in the parking lot"" because you're naive, hurt and inexperienced BUT her not coming out was a HUGE clue she did not want to meet you after work. She said she would meet you to avoid conflict. If you ask someone out at work be it a stripper or other profession they are a captive audience they are much more likely to politely difuse the situation rather then scream ""No"" at you. So if someone doesn't show STOP do not continue to pursue them, no Instagram etc. She didn't forget, she didn't get lost in the closet she left via another door or waiting until you left. Even outside of work sometimes women don't want to risk violence, yelling, name-calling or other harassment so we turn people down gently. She blocked you on Instagram, this is as clear as it gets. There is no misunderstanding she is not interested. Leave her alone. Going back is a good way to get the police called on you. "

She’s doing her job by listening to you, making you feel special and dancing but also protecting herself by not allowing you to contact her outside of work.

3,atvndx,t2_51y8so7,yyy_guy,NTA. but you need to realize that this whole thing is just business for her. you crossed the line when you tracked down her instagram by going into her personal life. she will probably be more careful in the future to not give a guy enough clues to traingulate her like that. she told you to wait in the parking lot because there is likely another exit for employees that can't be seen from the parking lot which allowed her to escape the scene. don't go back to explain anything. call that $100 the price of learning a lesson about life and move on.
3,atvndx,t2_x6cdp1k,SquirrelGirlVA,"Hoo boy. I'm not going to say that you're an asshole or not because this isn't an easy question to answer. I will say that at this point you're definitely at risk of being a creep and stalker. Whether or not she took advantage of you or not, the scenario and her actions make it look like she was never intending to for this to be anything other than a random hookup. While I suppose she could've been more clear, I also kind of get the impression that her job kind of heavily discourages her from outright telling people that whatever happens in the strip club is a pay for play fantasy scenario, since it could hurt business. Honestly, it doesn't matter if she was taking advantage of you and being an asshole or not. You can't impact or change her actions, but you can yours. I will also say that you will never get the closure you need from this stripper. Right now you're hurting and you're seeing this stripper as an outlet for that hurt. Again, you'll never get the closure you need from her because it's not *her closure* that you're ultimately looking for as you're more looking for answers to the hurt and everything that you're feeling from your recent breakup. I think that it would be far, far healthier for you to seek out a good therapist to talk to right now. You're at a pretty big cusp here. Your actions are borderline and could get either better or worse. Don't let them get worse. "
3,atvndx,t2_8n0uv,TheSilverPotato,"NTA but you literally walked into that one. Was it your first time at a strip club? They literally play guys for money for a living.

3,atvndx,t2_2rdbp4wg,yourboyfriendistrash,"NTA, just naive. I say NTA instead of ""no assholes"" because she is absolutely an asshole for leading you on. Her job is to dance and flirt, she crossed the line by telling you to wait for her after her shift because that took it from professional to personal, when she had no intention of following through, knowing that you were vulnerable. That was predatory of her. But yeah. Never assume that a sex worker is actually into you. They have a vested interest in making you feel like the most important guy in the room, but you're just another customer."
3,atvndx,t2_32fmj8kd,KjellRS,"ESH. She played you, the idea was to make you show up at the club again asking why she didn't show up.

She is not saying she wants you to move in. Reimagine this scenario as a female friend/cousin/coworker you genuinely like. She tells you that she ran into this guy at a coffee shop and struck up a conversation. He buys her coffee so she chats with Jim while making her coffee on her work break from her accounting office. He seems nice enough but also extremely sad because of a breakup. His friends noticed and offer to pay for her lunch tab if she will keep talking to him. She's hungry and it is dinner, he still seems mostly sad but nice, so sure why not. Then at lunch the guy says he can give her $100 to get dessert. Sure why not. He's been nice and he's sad so she even offers him accounting advice to help him sort out his finances from his ex. Tells him he shouldn't worry about his future because he is cute and nice, that everything works out. The next day she goes to leave work and see the guy standing outside her office... for an hour. Her friends tell her and they either sneak her out a different door or agree to wait it out until the guy leaves. Finally he does and she thinks coast is clear. Then he somehow finds her personal social media profile and messages her. He is not asking about accounting hell but instead talking about them and how much he likes her. She panics and tells her friends. She doesn't know how he found her and now he seems like the type of guy on a Criminal Minds episode. She blocks him. She gets to work and her friends at security have heard that guy who stood outside the office has been trying to message her. Then, the guy shows up at her office again. Take a guess how this story ends.....he does not get his taxes done. I can assure you of that. You paid for a service and she provided it. You have overstepped. Find somebody else to do your taxes"

There’s protection in the app for things going wrong. I have contacted these apps many times over wrong orders or missing items and they’ve never once even argued about returning my money.

It sounds like both of you are stressed out and both are really busy without a lot of space to accommodate the needs of the other. I think you're overreacting and unless there's more to it, it sounds like you may have some issues of anxiety and trust and getting too attached to friends. Maybe you relied on this friend too hard and spent too much time together without having other friends in your life. No need to burn bridges, just let things be. Maybe the schedules or situation will change in the future. Friends are SUPPOSED to be around and support you when it's convenient, they're not supposed to dedicate their life to you.

Your argument, taken to its logical conclusion, ends at adopted children not being ”real” children and that’s a really shitty mindset. My grandfather was from Ukraine but left the neighborhood they immigrated to, married a WASP American woman and taught none of his cultural traditions to his children. So, my dad was half Ukrainian with no connection to the family or culture besides visiting at Christmas. My dad left my mom before I was born, so I have even less cultural connection. My grandpa’s first cousin married a woman from their culture and raised his kids in a Ukrainian neighborhood. My dad’s second cousin was fully immersed in the culture, and though he married out of it, he fully passed it down to his children, my third cousins. I connected a few years ago with my third cousin and through DNA testing, we discovered that my third cousin is not his father’s son, and has no Eastern European DNA at all.

I wouldn’t be angry at him since culturally he’s Italian and was raised that way which I think is a nice thing because the traditional Italian family comes with great morals and tight knit relatives. Especially because he was adopted, I’m sure he cherishes that about himself. When you get angry at him for it, you’re basically rubbing in his face he’s adopted and should forget how he was raised because it’s not in his blood. I’m sure you can see how that can hurt him. "
3,b7t4ag,t2_j017v,G_Art33,"Culture is a result of nurture not nature. My grandfather was a blonde haired blue eyes pale skinned person from an unknown european country and was adopted by a Greek family as a young child. His last name was changed to apostolides, he was raised Greek and so he lived Greek and he was Greek and he took great pride in preserving the cuisine, values, and stories of his culture even if the culture didn’t belong to him genetically. So yeah YTA try to be more open minded. If that’s what your boyfriend takes pride in it’s probably because that’s what he feels is his identity as a person. If you can’t deal with him not being genetically Italian but still wanting to cook pasta and call himself Italian because that’s how he was raised please let him do him. "

A growing number of black people live in Korea for example. Their kids won't be ""Korean"" by ethnicity but for all intents and purposes they will be raised in the Korean culture and will behave ""Korean."" In a micro-level, he was raised Italian in an Italian-cultured home. That's not appropriation. That's an integral part of who he is.

If someone was adopted by a Polish family, would you say that being Polish isn’t part of their heritage? Cultural Appropriation isn’t INHERENTLY a bad thing. It’s only a problem when Its being used to trivialise or diminish marginalised cultures -e.g. reducing Native Americans to nothing more than a mascot or Halloween costume, He’s not doing that; he’s just honouring his family’s background.

And if you really insist on keeping the mindset of having one of your kids inherit the business... Wait until you can see which one has the most interest in the business; and DO NOT TELL THEM OF YOUR PLAN WHEN THEY ARE NINE YEARS OLD!! You had children. They are human beings. Not some heirs to a throne. They have every right to choose what they want to do. If none of them show interest? Pass it onto a good friend or relative or literally anyone else. If multiple show interest? Have them co own it. By automatically choosing one of them to run it; the others may feel inferior and jealous of their sibilings, not to mention the one chosen may feel trapped like they are forced to do it because you want them to.

I have to question your intelligence if you believe women can't successfully run businesses - a quick Google search would show you plenty of relevant examples of women who have done just that. It's 2019. Don't you want your daughter to also have dreams she can achieve and be successful and happy in life? Or if she came to you when she was 24 and told you that she was starting her own business, would you tell her she'll fail because she's not smart enough and she was born with a vagina so therefore can't possibly succeed?

If he ends up broke but his older brother is quite rich in later years he could really resent you for giving the eldest a high paying but not helping him. I understand that you plan for him to still get a job in said company but if he doesn’t like the fact that he didn’t get the company through no fault of his own he probably wouldn’t want to work there.

I'm also sure that since the oldest boy will run the business, the younger son will definitely, decided by you, make less money than his brother when he could very well be equally qualified, for the rest of his life. There is no chance that this kid won't resent you or his brother when he grows older.

You'll never be able to un-blow their life up, but you can mitigate that damage with your new circumstances and ensure that they are taken care of; I think, kids aside, this is an amazing gesture to your ex wife. It also sets a very clear example to your children, the kind of example that can make or break character. Your girlfriend on the other hand... her behavior reeks of an unjustified vendetta and terrible character, and I would take a very hard look at the actual benefit of continuing in a relationship with her. Not only did she knowingly engage in an affair with a married man (and yeah, you're the one who took vows, but IMO once the other woman/man knows their affair partner is married, they bear responsibility for the moral bankruptcy as well), but she is issuing an ultimatum here that you twist the knife by allowing your ex to continue in financial circumstances that were largely caused by your affair. It's not enough that she got the partner that she wanted at the expense of another woman who never wronged her and the children that she became the single mother of as a result; she is also heavily invested in ""winning"" via financial contrast as well. That's some downright cruel behavior and I really think you should evaluate whether you feel solid about being with someone who cares so much about the perceived power that she feels she holds over your ex wife's circumstances that she's willing to harm your children by proxy in order to keep it. Your kids would still benefit from that money even if you kept it all to yourself, but kids aren't stupid, man. By going out of her way to hurt their mother she goes out of her way to hurt them. If you allow that, it's not going to be her they're upset with later on. She's shown you who she is, I hope you believe her. For God's sake, don't marry the woman. Show her the door.

You say you still love your ex wife, maybe you need to examine the relationship with your girlfriend and figure out why you're still with her if she has a problem with you supporting your children. That's how I see this. You said you had the affair with her and that is why she is your current girlfriend. You know you hurt your ex wife and made a mistake. Honestly, like I said I think you need to re-examine your entire relationship with her and maybe face the reality of the fact that you still love your ex wife and maybe there is still a chance there. I understand that you're divorced but people have gotten back together after 20 years apart. You say you're not in love with your ex wife but for you to care that much about her not seeing you as a fuck up tells me that some part of you still is whether you want to acknowledge that or not. I think you need to examine that. In my opinion, if your girlfriend cannot understand that you are just trying to take care of your kids, then she is definitely not someone that you should consider spending a long period of time with. My ex had kids and he and his ex-wife would fight constantly. Was I thrilled with the situation? Of course not but I understood that they were his kids and that he had to talk to her and that their relationship was less than perfect. I would never try to stand in the way of his relationship with the mother of his kids or with his kids and I would actually be proud of him for being a man and stepping up to the plate and taking care of his kids. Your girlfriend has some serious growing up to do. If she's that upset about you giving your ex-wife money to take care of your kids, then in my opinion she was just hoping for some of that money and truthfully sounds like a gold digger. In my opinion I would get rid of her if I was you."
3,b43t53,t2_15aiee,TheDukeOf_Donuts,"You had every reason to tell nobody and give fuck all, you had absolutely no obligation whatsoever, yet you're ensuring the mother of your kids is able to provide them with, and enjoy herself, a comfortable life.

You don't dog the boys, you have nothing to feel bad about. NTA"
3,b43t53,t2_aj5h0,Shortandsweet33,"NTA, and take your girlfriend up on her kind offer to piss off out of your life. If you don’t, you will quickly find that she will do her best to bleed you dry of your new-found wealth and take advantage of you in every way possible. She’s shown you exactly what she is, and that’s an ugly, vindictive person. Turn a new leaf and let the trash take itself out. And don’t listen to her inevitable panicked fake apologies as soon as you call her bluff and end the relationship. More bonus advice. Even if you choose not to listen to me and break up with her, at least for the love of god do not marry her or give her access to your bank accounts. This woman is a snake and you should protect yourself. Also see a financial advisor and make wise investment decisions. "
3,b43t53,t2_2vlg7hcm,EmergencyLibrary,"NTA at all. Your ex wife sounds like a wonderful person and you made a huge mistake and you own it. She sounds like a great co parent and that's wonderful. Money won't make up for anything but if you have plenty of extra, and she's been this good and is a good person in general, then fuck yeah give her a piece if YOU want to. Your parents are on board and seem to love her as well so hell yeah, spread the love man. Tell her it's a way for her to live her life better and not worry about bills and whatnot and you guys just invest your money well so you can live off of it the rest of your lives if possible. Your girlfriend is just that....a gf. Not a wife, not a close family member. You being relieved over threats of her leaving make it seem like you're pretty ok with it and not in love with her either. She forgets that it's YOUR money, not hers, you can do as you please with it. Don't let her become some jealous moocher. She may switch her tune up just so she can stay with you and the money...NOT SAYING SHE WILL! It's just a legit thing to watch your back over when coming in to a shitload of money. Even if it does end and you find someone else, don't tell people your business and let them believe you have a whatever job. Nobody needs to know about your money. &#x200B;"

3,b43t53,t2_w24pd,v3r1,"NTA. Nothing wrong with making your children's lives as comfortable as possible and that includes a good life from both sides the parents represent. She behaved in a saint-like way when dealing with all of your bullshit and all your mistakes. Some women abuse men who treat them like goddesses but she treated you with respect when you maybe didn't deserve it that much. She is the incredible mother of your children. If you want to be good to her and use this money as a sort of payback for all you put her through I think you are absolutely doing the right thing. Your current gf sounds like a spoiled brat who doesn't understand half of the complexity of your relationship with your ex. Life is complicated like that. The thing to remember here is, you might actually change girlfriends, she will always be the mother of your kids. And tbh this money buys a good relationship with her essentially forever and that is GREAT for your kids. You 2 being on good terms is the best scenario possible and in this scenario your gf is irrelevant, she isn't more important than the kids. Do it!! :)"
3,b43t53,t2_4557i,W32Badwolf,"NTA - in fact I don't think anybody here is. My exact same fuckup will be 6 years ago in the summer, and everything including the ex's post-divorce attitude matches to a T. Your position: Perfectly reasonable, and I'm jealous that you have the opportunity to drastically improve the life of someone you hurt. I'm a little over 60k in to buying my soul back and I'm pretty sure I'll never feel like it's enough. (I know money doesn't make up for shitty behavior, but she can't buy groceries with my self-loathing either). Ex wife's position: NTA - I already like her. Like my ex, the first words out of her mouth weren't ""mama gonna get paid"". GF's position: I get it, and it isn't like she doesn't have a background in self-centered behavior. She's still the girl who was okay with her part in ending your marriage. She's right in line with who you knew she already was, and probably assumes you're going to ditch her now that you're screamingly wealthy anyway - because that's how people like her (and at the time, you) operate. Her behavior is reasonable because that's how she was rewarded with you to begin with. Discuss the gf thing with the lawyer as well. She's going to feel like she has a claim on your money and, without knowing where in the world you are, that could get really ugly. If I can project for a moment (assuming I haven't already), let her break up with you. She's still who she was, and you can do better than be reminded of your biggest fuckup every time you wake up in the morning. It'll be good for your head too. Love (and great envy) from a fellow traveler man. "
3,b43t53,t2_3fa9i9sh,TinktheChi,"NTA You love your kids and want them to have a better life via your ex-wife. Nothing wrong with that. Please stop beating yourself up about the affair. It was a mistake that you paid for in more ways than one. My fear with your girlfriend is that if you're living with her, she may be entitled to part of this money if she hits the road. I would look into that if I were you. As far as your ex-wife is concerned, what you are planning to do is a wonderful way to give your kids a better life, so good on you. You're a good father and a decent human being."
3,b43t53,t2_2wn2vfi8,Jesus__Skywalker,"NTA- It's your money and you have a right to do what you want. A lot of people can't relate to what it's like to have an amicable divorce with someone bc most of the time people wait until they hate each other to split. Facing the fear that your ex will make life hell for you with regards to your kids is a very legitimate fear and if your wife never made that hard on you, and you feel moved to do something for her...do it. And laugh about that shit with your gf. Let's see her dump a guy she was in love with before having money over something so trivial. Sounds to me like you have a good head on your shoulders and you are handling things well. Keep it up."
3,b43t53,t2_i4tbk,OldSpiceSmellsNice,"NTA. But yeah, now that you’re kind of ‘coming to your senses’ and wanting to do good, keep in mind not to punish/treat your gf poorly based on the fact that she cheated *with* you on your ex. It takes two to tango. Reading some of your responses makes me think you are starting to feel some sort of aversion to her because of that. Which isn’t really fair. Just ‘cause you got the means now doesn’t make you better than her. You were both shitty."
3,b43t53,t2_2ud9u5un,Aces361,NTA consider your girlfriend and moving forward and your will to protect your kids if that happens. Because your girlfriend will not look out for them the way you are. You’re a great dad and you and your ex wife are doing it right congrats on your win! 
3,b43t53,t2_kagrk,Trust_Me_Im_Right,"NTA- maybe consider putting the majority of the money in the name of your kids and then giving your ex wife enough to be comfortable. Current GF can't be mad about it going to the kids and the amount to the ex wife is enough so they never have to worry about struggling. At the end of the day though it's your money, do what makes you happy and anyone who tells you it's wrong can fuck off"
3,b43t53,t2_zphqh0j,JabroniBalogna88,NTA - and you should break up with that bitch unless she does a 180 pronto. SHE knew you were married and took advantage of it and wrecked your home... why would you even stay with someone that is willing to do that to other human beings. Not saying you aren’t at any fault but ffs her skull must be thick. Give you ex as much as you want and dump that greedy ass hoe that caused you to cheat. 
3,b43t53,t2_6d43ib0,steve2phonesmackabee,"NTA. I think this is a wonderful thing you are doing for your ex-wife and your children. That said, while i think your girlfriend is definitely being the asshole in this situation, I have a feeling that she's probably had a lot of insecurity in your relationship that's built up for a long time (possibly as a result of the circumstances surrounding how you and she came together.. guys who cheat are often prone to do it again) and this totally understandable gesture is causing it to come to a head. Whether you want to work through that with her or cut her loose is your choice."
3,b43t53,t2_foy6p,Caryria,You are NTA and massive respect to you for it. You are making sure that the mother of your children and therefore your children are looked after. Just because you and your ex aren’t together any more doesn’t mean you still but need to work together for the good of your children and if your current partner can’t see that then more fool her. When my parents split up my dad pretty much washed his hands of us. My sisters still spoke to him and he occasionally bought things for them but rarely. He never paid child support but was able to drive around in swanky cars and wear expensive clothes. I’ve no respect for him and he only speaks to one of my sisters now as the other lost respect for him as well. 
3,b43t53,t2_dqn6r2o,Futureretroism,NTA also lets be real you just got filthy rich the GF isn’t going anywhere and if she wants out because you want to better care for your kids and appreciate their mother then it sounds like it may be for the best.
3,b43t53,t2_385gi0ez,thankeesai62,"NTA. Congratulations, your troubles are over. Just do you best to make sure new trouble doesn't arise. One thing you said that confuses me is ""like a saint your ex-wife ALLOWED you to see the kids"". I was a bit shocked by that. Even if you cheat, you are still a parent and have rights to your kids, correct? It's good of you to still care for the human that your ex is, and she seems like a good enough person not to piss the money away. I'm also assuming you will set the kids up financially, like with a trust or something? Nothing wrong here, don't let the girlfriend bring you down. Stay ahead of the eight ball here, friend. Many good wishes to you! "
3,b43t53,t2_rn4uu3j,dontbreakmystar,Nta at all. She's the mother of your children who you did wrong. Its wonderful gesture that you would want to gift her money to help her and support your children. Your gf on the other hand seems to discount your children and be jealous. If you won millions it wont matter if you share it with your children and their mother. You're being a good father and extending the olive branch to your wife to show you want a healthy relationship post divorce and showing what a good healthy relationship with an ex spouse can look like. You're being a good father first of all. Your gf is being a bitter turd by saying they shouldn't get anything. 
3,b43t53,t2_7wbn0,BillsInATL,">My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. NTA - That's all I had to see. Obviously this is to make their lives easier and better. I can kinda understand where your current GF is coming from, because this you definitely **were** the asshole previously and your entire situation is completely fucky with so much overlap. She will always be insecure of your relationship with your ex-wife and she has good reason to be since you were a cheater when you met her. But to address your primary question, you are not the asshole for giving the ex the money."
3,b43t53,t2_32evy,krunk7,"NTA But gifting is a terrible idea from a tax perspective. Mine as well set 1/2 of it on fire. Please go to a sworn fiduciary with experience handling accounts your size for some decent advice on how to beat maintain and transfer wealth......otherwise you’ll be yet another lottery winner with a big house note, a sports car, and an empty bank account."
3,b43t53,t2_1lie3psa,pineapplerevisited,"NTA for so many reasons 1) your money, your decision 2) your kids take priority over a girlfriend 3) the gf was ok with disrespecting the now ex by cheating so clearly disrespect isn't the issue 4) sounds like you still have lots left over so why is she that upset unless, 5) she's interested in the money for herself, which means 6) this is bad news bears for you, OP. If she resents you, it's going to be hard to salvage the dating relationship. "
3,b43t53,t2_13o52v,okiedokieKay,"NTA. It is normal for a girlfriend to be upset about this, but her reaction was clearly amplified because your relationship started with an affair, so any tiny bridges between you and another woman will raise affair flags in her head and get a much grander reaction than deserved. She needs to get over it though because this decision impacts your children more than anyone. Good on you for letting her walk if it turns into an ultimatum. Plus, I would be kind of surprised if a judge wouldn’t raise your child support payments after a windfall like this?... when my friend got a promotion at work the CS was recalculated and he had to pay more out due to it. If you just give a chunk to the mom that is a more than fair solution. "
3,b43t53,t2_c4j8evm,realclearmews,"NTA. Also, take the chance to get rid of the girlfriend that she's offering you -- there's no way she's actually going to leave you now that you have tons of money and this kind of mentality (fuck you to your ex and kids and unwilling to share when there's more than enough) combined with the lack of moral compass required to get involved with a married guy shows that you do not want to be with her. So tell her it's over, by her request. Then you're not the asshole for dumping his partner once striking it rich."
3,b43t53,t2_1rlqmeir,a1337sti,"NTA - that would be a difficult situation , if your significant other wins a bunch of money and the first thing they do is give a bunch to their EX. As it would make that person feel like though they are number two in your life and not in the number one slot. If you're feeling relieved over the threats that she's going to break up with you I think that means you have to break up"
3,b43t53,t2_151vsw,nauseatedunicorn,"NTA - it is your money and you can do whatever you want with it. With that being said what your gf might mean but is having trouble articulating is that it would have been nice for the two of you to have a conversation about it first such as ""hey gf, I've won a lot of money and I've been thinking about what to do with it. A will go into savings, B we'll invest, C we can use to treat ourselves, but D is to go to my ex so that she and my kids can live a better life"". I think she just expects to be treated like a partner which she can't be blamed for but her jealousy is becoming the bigger issue. "
3,b43t53,t2_1hoagveq,methylenebluestains,"NTA. Honestly your ex sounds great and if it's your money, why the hell not? In the end you're helping your kids and helping their mother. No offense, but your girlfriend should not be talking about disrespect here. Home wrecking is pretty goddamn disrespectful. I don't know if you're still in love with your ex, but you clearly hold her in high regard. I'd say let the relationship go. She doesn't value your children's financial well-being which is a red flag all on its own. Plus if you feel *relieved* that she's threatening to break up, then it's probably worth it just to do it yourself"
3,b43t53,t2_zf748,ZarathustraX13,"NTA I don't know you but you seem like a good man who made a mistake in the past and is trying to make it right as best you can. My father cheated on my mother and was 100% responsible for the divorce. Instead of taking responsibility, he sued her for everything, including custody. She fought back and in the end they spent hundreds of thousands in legal fees and he ruined everyones life in the process. My point is many ex-husbands would rather destroy everything around them than give the mother of his children a dime. Your gf sounds like my step mother, who is the one pulling the strings. She is half of the reason for the divorce, she doesn't get a vote. I wish my father was like you."
3,b43t53,t2_zsml6qg,TheFoxAndTheRaven,"NTA. It's your money and wanting to provide a better life for your children and their mother is commendable. Meanwhile, your girlfriend is someone that knowingly slept with a married man. Now she's feeling paranoid and displaying a cheater's mentality, entertaining the thought that you might just as easily cheat on her based on her own values (*I'm not saying that you would now -it sounds like you've owned your mistake- but once you've done it that card is always on the table)*. She needs to respect that you're always going to have some level of involvement with your ex because you have two children in common. That's non-negotiable and screaming at you over this is *not* okay. "
3,b43t53,t2_1grnby08,ohhlookshiny,"NTA. I am going to go out on a limb here and say the girlfriends threat to break up is pretty empty, morals are low here, and she isn't going to want to leave her newly rich boyfriend. She doesn't sound like she has matured much in 6 years from the woman sleeping with a married man. At least you show remorse over it, and respect to your ex. It's sad she wants to be so petty towards a woman whose marriage she helped ruin. "
3,b43t53,t2_1pli486u,YURUMADBRO,"NTA. This doesn't seem like a gift with any sort of strings attached, you're not getting anything out of it directly. You're not trying to get back with the ex-wife. There is also an inherent value in making the quality of life for your children's mother better. If she's happier, that should directly and positively affect the lives of your children. &#x200B; > My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. Her reaction is problematic, and your feelings about it are indicative of the course of action to prescribe... end it. &#x200B;"
3,b43t53,t2_10npl4ly,Certifiedbeanbag,"NTA - I think that you’re doing a wonderful and thoughtful thing by giving some to her and your children. You’re showing your kids respect to their mother, and a desire to make sure no matter who they’re staying with, that they have a happy and nice home. Your current gf could understandably feel worried, as it is less common , however thats because most people wouldn’t be so thoughtful. Your ex wife wasn’t abusive, mean or a bad mother, in you’re words she is a really good person. You’re investing in that. If you’re current partner is someone you plan to stay with long term, suggest a nice holiday together to reassure her of her value to you, in a way you both can enjoy and create memories. Then with your ex wife, along with the money to go towards her home and the kids, get her something she can use directly for her hobbies as a extra personal gift (ie: camera for photography). "
3,b43t53,t2_x6cdp1k,SquirrelGirlVA,"NTA for wanting to give your ex money. It's *your* money, not your girlfriend's and you can do what you want with it. OP, I definitely recommend that you retain a lawyer as soon as possible so that your girlfriend doesn't try to do something to mess with your money somehow in retribution. I can kind of see her getting upset, but you being relieved makes me think that you've been looking for a reason to leave her but perhaps didn't because you didn't want to be alone or want to break it off and be the ""bad guy"". OP, I also recommend that you look into a therapist to kind of talk things over with since I think that you're dealing with a lot and this uninvolved party could be really helpful to talk to. "
3,b43t53,t2_3f1ufnug,hippie_hippie_shake,"NTA. I think that’s a very pure and kind gesture actually. While money “can’t buy happiness”, it can certainly relieve certain stresses a person experiences, of which I’m assuming you’ve caused a lot for your ex wife in the past, and provide them with a better quality of life. You’re not trying to buy her love back, it seems more like you’re trying to atone for your mistakes and help her provide for your children more easily. I would say your girlfriend sucks for her reaction, but anyone who knowingly sleeps with a married man sucks anyway. It’s your money, not hers. Do what you feel is right in this situation and she can get on board or not, but she doesn’t get to dictate how you use these winnings."
3,b43t53,t2_16x1h2,klaxz1,"NTA. She’s a girlfriend and she sounds like a piece of shit. I’d let her go ahead and leave, but I doubt she will due to the money. Personally, I would take the annuity and open trusts in everyone’s names. The ones for your kids can pay back into themselves until they go to college, but your ex-wife and yourself can get a check every month or quarter or whatever you decide. Your lives will be changed permanently without risking going broke."
3,b43t53,t2_56hrh,TheGarp,"NTA But I would have recommended dong it in such a way so it isn't tied to the wife directly such as a trust fund for the kids' education, distribute a monthly allowance, car when they are 16, etc.. This would allow the ex wife to have funds freed up without being a direct payout to her. "
3,b43t53,t2_12hm6j,Doomstar32,"NTA. You grew up, you realized your mistakes and you are doing right by the mother of your kids. The next step of growing up might be getting rid of the woman you cheated on your wife with. Those relationships don't usually end well. She had full knowledge of your marriage and participated in the affair anyway. Is that someone you want to be with long term?"
3,b43t53,t2_3fqjnts0,ArnavChalla,"NTA Wow, your ex seems like an amazing person, she has been through all this, And I agree, helping her out would definitely be some compensation, and would give her some time to relax. Your gf is just jealous, and another thing you mentioned, she's an amazing parent, she could give a better life to your children and your children could go to colleges without taking loans and worrying about every dollar. Edit: op mentioned that his current gf knew about his wife when he had an affair, this further consolidates my point."
3,b43t53,t2_88r2qze,DeadlySquaids14,"NTA. This is the right thing to do for your children, and it is good that you also want your ex to be able to enjoy it(because as much as you may regret your past mistakes, you don't have any obligation to her anymore so it's commendable for you to think of her.) Concerning your girlfriend, it sounds to me like she's insecure about anything involving your ex. Not trying to be judgemental, but in my experience, the ""other woman/man"" tends to be insecure involving the ex. She could be thinking ""he cheated on HER with ME, what's to stop him cheating on ME with HER?"" Maybe she doesn't want you doing nice things for your ex because she sees that as you ""going back"" to her. Food for thought."
3,b43t53,t2_4roorqg,SicksTea9,NTA I think what you did was very noble. I'm going to be honest with you about your current gf though. You are very wealthy now. She seems very problematic. You don't speak about her like you're in love with her. That's all I'm going to say about that. Also be really wise with that money as most people who win significantly in the lottery declare bankruptcy in a surprisingly short amount of time. You seem really intelligent though so I'm sure you'll be fine.
3,b43t53,t2_17a1yk,laidback26,"Straight up without reading what others wrote your gf is the asshole. Like you said, your fuck, involving your gf, is what fucked up your marriage. Your ex is the mother of your children. She works a shit job. She has been fantastic about making sure you and your parents are in the kids lifes. She isn't using them to hurt you, which I seen with my brother and his ex sadly. Yes, you grown apart but she hasn't asked for anything but to be a good dad. You realize your fuck up with your now gf is what caused the marriage to fall apart. Your ex handled it like a champ and respectful human being. You two don't hold any grudges against each other. You want to help better her since she is single trying to survive and the mother of your kids which woudl better them. You are doing the right thing. Your gf, the reason your marriage fell apart is a asshole. If she can't see by helping her you are also helping your children she is thinking of herself only. Sounds like she is worried about cheating on her although she had no problems being the cheater. I would let her walk with nothing and go your own way and use your heart to help guide you."
3,b43t53,t2_ztbew,garmdian,NTA. But your making excuses to give her the money. Saying it's for the kids and such which is I guess a small part of it but mostly it's just bragging rights. Saying see I have money now so I can't have screwed up everything. Face the facts and accept the giving the money is not for anyone else but yourself. Still it's a sweet sentiment dispute the excuses you make for yourself and I'm happy for you.
3,b43t53,t2_2zejmj,grizwald87,"You've already received good advice (NTA, it was a noble gesture), but I just wanted to add on another note that you should find a good financial advisor immediately, preferably one who charges you a flat hourly rate for advice. The newly wealthy and their money are soon parted, usually due to stupid investments and/or gross overspending that doesn't account for the fact that their money came to them from a lump sum and not a permanent income. Watch the 30 for 30 ""Broke"" to scare yourself straight, and as hard as it's going to be, avoid making any more lavish outlays until you and a professional have done the math on how much you can afford to spend every year without your new good fortune going to zero. Oh, and maybe don't marry the new girlfriend. Anybody who cheats on your wife with you and then complains when you give that wife and your kids money has questionable foundations for a long-term partnership. Congratulations!"
3,b43t53,t2_336gx9qb,exwasadickthrowaway,NTA she has to except that in a way you're always going to prioritize your ex because she's the mother of your kids. You can't expect much from someone who's going to cheat with a married man with children tho. Your wife deserves it for being so patient with you I would've dropped your ass in a heart beat.
3,b43t53,t2_zj4m3,A_Redheads_Ramblings,NTA &#x200B; You realize you messed up and while no amount of money can make up for the pain and hurt your actions caused your ex-wife you're stepping up to make her life easier while she raises your babies. Well done sir. Well done. &#x200B; Your gf sounds like a money grubbing harpy and if she's wants to break up with you then let her.
3,b43t53,t2_1312yp,xela2004,"NTA, by freeing up her financially you are giving your kids a better life because they will have more of their mom and not have to see her with hardships. It’s a quality of life for your kids, and they should come before any gf. If you didn’t have kids with her, well then that would be a different story. "
3,b43t53,t2_184he00d,girlwhoweighted,NTA. Why does it feel like your gfs life mission is to see your ex as miserable as possible? She didn't help fuck up her life enough but now she had to begrudge her some financially gifting from you that will improve the quality of your children's life as well. I'm guessing she had a lot of other control issues too. Do what makes your soul feel right. You screwed up once by cheating and look what you lost. Don't let your girlfriend ruin your amicable relationship with your wife at this point
3,b43t53,t2_3a8temud,PuffLaughLogic72,"Sounds like the only reason YTA is because you’re stringing this other woman on for years. You clearly felt that she was a mistake, don’t have much respect for the relationship since you didn’t want to discuss it with her or share in your excitement with her and you seem fine with her leaving now that you’ve got some skrilla. That’s a pretty shitty way to end things especially for her. Make her think you’ve left your wife for her only to never have really dedicated yourself and now that you get some money you’re throwing it at the ex because of guilt and tossing her out like trash. Pretty low in that respect. As far as trying to be helpful to the mother of your children I guess to a small degree it still is commendable but not wholeheartedly. Sounds like you deserve to regret what you did and this can’t actually fix that which makes all of what you’re doing very self serving disguised as some sort of chivalry. But selfishness is probably how you got here in the first place. Let’s hope this isn’t some desperate attempt to buy back the ex. I can’t imagine she’d appreciate that if she is the woman you say. Shitty situation. Sorry man. "
3,b43t53,t2_i5rrl,lyingtattooist,"NTA - you won’t have any problems finding plenty of women to be with and you’ll be way better off in the long run being single for now. But be prepared for your gf to apologize, kiss your ass and do everything possible to stay with your money. It’s up to you to decide if you still want to be with her. Be careful though, stay with her for too long and she’ll be a common law spouse or domestic partner which means she could have claim to some of the money. "
3,b43t53,t2_1wppp964,whatcolorizthat,"Nta. Of course you want your kids to be provided for no matter where they are. It is a little worrisome that you still seem to be very much in love with your ex wife, and that could be assholish in itself depending on why you are still with your girlfriend. But the act of giving your ex wife money is an entirely separate issue. I know without a doubt that my husband holds Zero flame for his ex, but if we were suddenly millionaires you better believe his ex wife would end up with enough to not have to worry about a stable home for SD. "
3,b43t53,t2_gslwz7h,LBDazzled,"NTA - my parents have been divorced for far longer than they were married (married eight years, divorced for 37) and my dad would *still to this day* give my mom a cut of his money even though my sister and I are in our 40s. It's not like you're giving *all* of the money to her - you're doing right by your kids and being kind to their mother, a person with whom you'll always feel a connection. Your girlfriend is being selfish and manipulative - I think her true colors are showing!"

She is the mother of your children and it would be heartless to give them a fantastic life and their mother not be able to. I mean, I wouldn’t set her up so much that it affected you, but a substantial amount that’ll see her and the kids through. Like, last Sunday I won £6200 at bingo. Me and my BF shared, so it was £3100 each. We knew that we wanted to use the £5000 of it to pay off credit cards, leaving us with £1200. I suggested we give the £200 to my sister who was low on cash, just that small amount made her day and my partner was all for it, didn’t even tell me to take it out of my half. If it can improve someone’s life, then go for it. Your current GF sounds like a witch, the wife seems so much better!"

You had vows with her once and bringing her some of your prosperity really makes you a wonderful man. Now, gf is being an ungrateful brat. Let her go. I'm surprised you stayed with her after leaving your wife- I'm curious you settled for her. As if to say cheating on your wife was a grave life mistake but staying with your fuck-buddy was a good decision? She's the one you needed when you were down, she's not the one- the one true person for you. If she were, you'd have said so. Go into the world and find yourself a soul mate. Very few people are given your opportunity- so please go find the right woman not the right-now woman, k? You get to explore the world- chances are your best matches partner is out there- chances are very slim it's the gf. Send her off with some material possessions. New fancy car, new fancy tits, new fancy pilates instructor or pool boy. She'll be alright."

Wanting your kids, and the person most responsible for them (or second most, if you have primary custody) to enjoy a heightened lifestyle now that you're able is a good thing, not selfish. Just from your 4 paragraphs I'm relieved on your behalf that you didn't marry her. Things would not end well with this money. Congratulations on your win. "
3,b43t53,t2_dk4gojr,YoungDiscord,"YTA &#x200B; I can sum it up with a simple quote: > accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I’m not *in* love with her. We’ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her It feels like you're trying to make excuses, you either love your ex or you don't, what you're debating here is semantics and to prove this further: you just said that once you got the cash the first people you contacted about this were your parents (Ok that's understandable) and then your ex... before you even contacted your gf so that basically tells me that very clearly your ex means more to you than your current partner. Then there is the case as to why you gave the ex the cash... I can understand if you gave her cash for the sake of the children, ok that's fine and you kinda hint on that but you also gave her cash for her, to and I quote > be able to pursue her hobbies this way Look if this were like a tiny gesture then I get it but I'm guessing that you didn't just give her a few cents and that you probably gave her a ton of cash, you know a HUGE gesture. &#x200B; then there is this: > I haven’t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board &#x200B; Ok so you already had a wife and kids and family, right? so you should be already more than aware of the fact that when you are in a relationship, you share your life with someone else. That being said, you aren't in a relationship with your ex but you are in a relationship with your current girlfriend and yet you didn't feel the need to share this life changing event or give her a say in any of this whatsoever before telling your parents your ex and even your lawyer... like why are you even with her if you're going to keep putting her in last place especially behind your ex... and no your kids aren't an excuse, its ok if you put your kids in front of your gf, I don't think she has a problem with that but your ex is not your kids, you can put your kids first without putting your ex in first place. &#x200B; &#x200B; Then there's this gem: > I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I’m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. You are very obviously not over any of this in any way, it sounds like your gf is the rebound girl or just a filler until you figure out a way to get back together with your ex, if you were truly over this whole fiasco you wouldn't feel the need to prove anything to her because why would it matter at this point and you wouldn't really care... as in you wouldn't care for your ex any more than you'd care for a stranger. Its fine if you're not over this and you're still struggling but don't bring in other people and hurt them just for the sake of being able to lie to yourself about ""moving on"" when you clearly did not, that's just some grade A asshole move, your gf probably feels like the third wheel in a non-existent relationship between you and your ex right now, put yourself in her shoes and think about how that would make you feel personally. &#x200B; &#x200B; Next in the line of assholery we have this: > She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way Ok so she has a shitty job... and this is your problem how? I understand if you'd have said that you worry because she might not be able to provide for your kids because she has a crappy job but that's not what you said, you basically said that because of her crappy job she can't pursue her dreams... so you're very obviously doing this for her even though you have nothing to do with her having a crappy job. This just feels like you're trying to still be a part of the old relationship that just doesn't exist anymore, either end the relationship with your current gf and try to get your ex back or close that old chapter in your life once and for all and move on making a life with your gf where she comes first, not your ex, not both. &#x200B; Someone once said that a person's priority can be seen based on how much attention he gives to things, in this case you've spent a ton talking about your ex wife and her life etc and ""proving yourself but only have half a sentence about your kids or your current gf even though this entire post is supposed to be about your current situation with your gf due to what you did, not about your ex. &#x200B; I don't think you are a bad person despite messing up or having flaws and I'm sure you mean well however you have got to stop lying to yourself and be honest otherwise you're going to mess things up with your new gf on top of messing things up with your ex... don't do that to yourself, you can't truly develop as a person if you aren't totally honest with yourself and I understand if you are scared of feeling like a fuckup but for what its worth, what makes you a fuckup isn't messing up or being wrong, its refusing to admit to your mistakes, refusing to learn new things and moving on because of your ego and you don't need to prove anything to anyone, not even yourself... you're fighting a fight you're not going to win because you're never going to feel good enough because the problem isn't whether you're good enough or not but the regret of what you did... that's what you need to overcome mate... should you have been better and not cheated on her? yeah... should you be proud of messing up? hell no, should you be ashamed of messing up? well no as long as you use it as an opportunity to learn and become better... you can't turn back time so don't waste your life on regretting and wanting to change back what you already can't change. You deserve to be happy, you deserve a good life even if you messed up, just cut the bullshit first otherwise it will be impossible for you to ever be happy again. &#x200B; &#x200B;"
3,b43t53,t2_13upo0,pittsburgpam,"NTA. There are way too many people who would do the exact opposite... and they'd be wrong. Why are deadbeat dads such a thing? Because it IS a thing. You don't OWE your ex wife anything but it will surely benefit your children and that you DO owe. My daughter's ex does everything he can to not pay her what he's supposed to, even quitting jobs and working under the table when he was court ordered to. Their 3 children suffer the most including their mother working 2 jobs. &#x200B; Good on you for doing this for them and your GF needs to be kicked to the curb. It's nothing off her nose, or out of her pocket, and a decent, caring person wouldn't be such an ass about you taking care of your children like that."
3,b43t53,t2_1zxyhw,creep2deep,NTA man. It literally means that your ex can have a higher quality of time with YOUR kids. She will now be able to spend time with them engaging in their personal well being. Sure nannies can do this but now you and your kids biological parents can engage hugely in their kids lives. Good for you man. I also have a good relationship with my ex despite a bit of a rough break up. It is about the kids. The kids come first. You doing this is so huge for the half of the time the spend with their moms and they will grow up loving you more because of this. Your girlfriend sounds young or immature.

You know that granting a windfall to your ex will enable her to provide a better environment for your children. It will free up her to pursue her own path of happiness. There are different types of love. You can still love your ex, respect her, wish the best for her, and not have to be in love with her. A lot of people just don't get that. How does your girlfriend interact with your kids? Is she a part of their life? i would like to think that if she is, she would see the the trickle down effect that this will have on your children. But you already know the ending to that tale, don't you? "
3,b43t53,t2_e5xvf,Nurizeko,"NTA for wanting to give her money to help with your kids. YTA though for fucking up what seems to be a good thing, the adultery, your loyalties are clearly divided. Your GF is an asshole to because of her reaction, but nothing occurs in a vacuum, and I think she is not entirely without cause to suspect you're actually still torn between her and your ex...mainly because your very post here drips with that vibe. You clearly don't seem to even want to be with her, as you suggest in your final sentence. Fork over a hefty wad of cash for your kid's sake, you however have absolutely no right and therefore should not even think of affording yourself the delusion that this is a way for you to slither back into your ex wive's good graces. You've done enough damage. Help out financially where your obligations demand, and otherwise move on and have the decency to not hurt anyone else. "
3,b43t53,t2_2t0aoi2h,et-regina,"NTA. Given that your ex-wife sounds like a decent woman and a good mother it's almost a given that she would use this money to provide a better life for your children; if you had a particularly acrimonious divorce, I would suggest putting a chunk of the money into a savings account/trust fund in your children's names for them to inherit once they turn 18 and to simply increase any monthly child support payments you make to her to account for your new wealth, but given that you and her seem to have a really good relationship still despite the ending of your marriage its totally fine that you would want to just give the money directly to her since you trust her to make sensible decisions with it for the benefit of your children - if she ends up spending that money on things that also benefit her, like better housing or hobbies, then I think that's fine as long as you have no problem with it. Your girlfriend really doesn't have a say in what you do with the money, particularly regarding your intention to invest that money in your children's lives through your ex-wife. "
3,b43t53,t2_9g96h,mongoosedog12,"NTA. I’m sorry I find it slightly hilarious the women you cheated on your wife with is pissed you’re giving her money. Like she thought that once she stole you all contact and feelings would be cut off? You have kids with this woman and you talk very highly of her and I feel like this is exactly how divorced parents should act, not bad mouthing but together to continue to raise their children in a healthy environment. You giving her money will mostly likely ease some fiscal burden and give your kids a better life, If you’re GF is pissed because you’re taking care of your kids then she needs a wake up call. Sorry honey you aren’t a wifey or the mother of his kid. "
3,b43t53,t2_rk0yo,falls_asleep_reading,"NTA To some extent, I can understand why your girlfriend might feel the way she does, but your ex is the mother of your children who could have really dragged you over the coals in your divorce. She put the kids first. Now you're recognizing that and doing likewise by making sure they have the same standard of living at both mom's and your place and making sure mom can relax more and focus on ""wants"" sometimes rather than just ""needs."" To me, it's admirable to see two parents respecting one another and putting the kids first. I'm not a fan of the girlfriend's reaction, but I don't have to live with her. FWIW, it's been a couple decades since a member of my family's ex cheated on her and married the woman he cheated with and my family member still won't have anything to do with the new wife, so it's probably a good idea not to expect much to change there."
3,b43t53,t2_2uos3inv,GloomyRaindrop,NTA. Not at all. I grew up with divorced parents. My situation was probably incredibly close to the way your kids are currently growing up with my Mom and Dad still getting along really well. I think it’s amazing that your kids get to grow up with that example being set for them. I would say don’t ignore that feeling of relief that you get when the GF threatened to break up with you. You have it for a reason. The fact that she’s giving you an ultimatum in regards to the quality of your kids lives in both of their households is really shitty too.
3,b43t53,t2_2aadfaua,gabberrella24,"NTA...but dude, you’re still in love with your ex-wife and it’s so obvious you would rather be with her than your gf. If you were kind of happy about the threats of her leaving, then that’s a clear indication that it’s time you set the gf free to find a relationship with someone who can give his full heart to her. Yours is still with your ex. It’s an incredibly nice gesture to include her in the payout for your winnings. Truly. Perhaps it will help mend a broken relationship, but she has more than good reason to not trust you to take you back. Being a good co-parent may be all you get but it sounds like it’s working for you two now. "
3,b43t53,t2_139j1o,fatlittletoad,"NTA at all. You want to do right by your kids and the woman who is raising them. I would gladly carve off a chunk of lottery winnings for my ex husband, though our daughter is only there once every few months, because he and his wife are like family to us and our kids (closer than our own families tbh) and I don't want to see them struggle or my daughter's sister through them not have the same opportunities she does. Coming into money is one of those times where you see the true character of the people you know. I think it's time to reflect on that in regards to all of your relationships."
3,b43t53,t2_h4ggj,Baltusrol,"NTA, sounds like gf is very jealous and insecure. I suspect she’s afraid she might get stiffed, which is silly because if she stays with you she’d benefit from what you have. But she has no real claim on the money so she’s anxious ... so close $$$$, yet so far away $$$$..... Anything you do to improve your ex’s life will improve your kids lives too. They are your #1 priority so you’re doing the right thing for sure. "
3,b43t53,t2_126xfs,xoxo_gossipwhirl,"NTA. I’m so confused that a woman you left your wife for thinks you still want your wife. Like, you ended your marriage for her. I think it’s great that you gave your ex a large sum, she takes for the kids at least half as much as you did right? I feel like, if you didn’t have kids together, maybe it could be a little suspicious, but the kids thing makes it all make sense for sure "
3,b43t53,t2_9bmev29,IrkedCupcake,"NTA I applaud you for your handling of this because many, many people wouldn’t be as mature/responsible? For lack of better words at the moment. I always say, “a good time that starts bad, ends bad” so in my opinion not much loss if she decides to dump you over such a childish thing. I’m going to be honest, I loathe cheaters. I wasn’t married but I was in a serious relationship and I was cheated on by someone I considered a best friend. I seriously thought he was so smart and kind that I couldn’t see myself with anyone else. It was like a knife to the heart when I found out how, when, and with who he cheated. I’m glad you are able to look back and admit what you did was wrong. Stick to your guns and don’t sway because your mistress feels disrespected. She should understand that your kids are priority. If she doesn’t, then she’s not the type you should be with anyways. Heck, if I dare say, work on your relationship with your kids mother. Who knows? Maybe someday you can rekindle that flame. I wouldn’t blame her if she didn’t want to retry, but it seems you’ve grown and you never know :)"
3,b43t53,t2_haxpp,stelleypootz,"NTA. I'd love to hear how you're disrespecting the mistress you cheated with to take care of your family? At least you admitted your mistakes and are trying to make amends and take care of your responsibility. Fact is, divorce and two households are expensive. I'm sure there are debts from your marriage as well as retirement, college, homes , etc. You are doing right to get that taken care of. GF is trying to compete and she's failing miserably. The fact you said you're relieved tells everything. It's over with her and you know it. You need to tell your lawyer this so you can protect yourself. "
3,b43t53,t2_2mmspo6n,Detective-Panda,"NTA You want to take care of your previous partner and the caretaker of your children there is nothing wrong with that, it is a very good thing. I think your girl friend might have her priorities different from yours but make sure you communicate your reasons for why with your gf"
3,b43t53,t2_144g2q,happydayswasgreat,"NTA. You're a good person, and want to help the mother of your kids have a great quality of life for your kids, and her too. If it feels right and good, and you've taken some time to think it over, good for you. (Like more than a few days). If she is free to live a different life, and be a better version of herself, she'll be a better mother, withmore time to spend with her children. Whilst a walk in the park is free, or playing cards is free, clearly, some money to have other experiences together is also lovely. I do something ever so slightly similar. I earn twice what my ex husband earns. He earns a good very livable wage (kinda) but I want to help keep him live a little closer to the quality of life we would have had together, because I'd like the kids to have little things (just lilt things, not multiple games consoles, and designer clothes!), I'd like them to take a vacation, get take out, go to the movies, and it not be a massive drain on his finances. He knows a judge would never require I pay him anything, but I want to. So we call it spousal maintenance, and it works great. As he earns more, I pay him a little less. I don't do it because I feel guilty, it just feels right. I'm expecting a significant pay increase soon, and am planning to help him pay off his (50% of what was our) debt. My last boyfriend didn't get it, and it was the main reason that made me realize i didn't wasn't to be with him. If i hadn't been told by a judge to pay it, why am i giving him $1k a month?! He would say. Life is short. Co parenting with care for everyone is important, and can be done with honest grace. But I'm learning it's rare. If I can help him and the kids live a better quality life, I'm going to. Every damn time. I have a plan to pay my own debt in 3 years, which im very proud of, and i have a plan to offer to help him. Of course if he declines my offer, I'll totally respect that. I'd funny, what worries me most, is when my kids understand how much I earn, but how frugal I make us live, because I'm paying down debt, I'm so ashamed of my debt, but I totally own it. And its the best lesson to my kids. Hey kids, this is what i did, don't do that!!! I can't wait to be debt free, and actually live a little differently. Anyway, i digress. It's funny what we wish for isn't it. I see my ex like a brother now. I care for him, and live him like family, but no, i don't want to be married to him anymore, but I want to help him, so I do. And I'm not embarrassed or ashamed about that."
3,b43t53,t2_28mxhr6t,throwawaythisuser1,"What you did 6 years ago is inexcusable. The ex sounds like she would've been supportive of you, with whatever you were going through at the time, but that's not the question here. You doing right by the kids, and that's what matters.

3,b43t53,t2_12pa80,Eschatonbreakfast,"Honestly NTA 1. Your ex wife could probably try and sue you for the money, and depending on the state she might be able to win. And honestly, if she's raising your kids, extra money for support and making your kids life better makes sense anyway. 2. I would definitely talk to a lawyer about the best way to get money to her. Large sums of money are going to create gift tax issues. If the money is deemed part of a support settlement (where she disclaims any future claim against you), you might be able to avoid gift taxes. I don't know, but it's definitely worth a look. 3. Your girlfriend is being kind of an asshole, maybe not completely irrationally if she just wants some reassurance that you're not going to dump her and get back with your wife. She could also have dollar signs in her eyes. I would definitely prenup if you ever tie the knot. 4. I'd also talk to a lawyer about creating a family trust to make sure that money is there to do what you want for your children and everything if anything happens with you. "

I obviously don't know you personally, but I think this is great. Go for it. Your girlfriend should get over herself. "
3,b43t53,t2_15asxt,AmberKinza,"NTA. You’re a great dad and a great man if you can acknowledge your faults and try to work on them, as well as trying to right the wrongs you’ve done to others. Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but for me the girlfriends reaction shows a hint of jealousy at the fact that you were in a previous marriage and she wants you to solely be focused on her. You saying you love your ex-wife (despite you not meaning it in a romantic way) could have solidified that thinking. "
3,b43t53,t2_14kf22,mommmabear2,"NTA. In fact. You have your priorities straight... regardless of the “slip up” 6 years ago. You are co parenting. It benefits your children to care for their mother. Regardless of your relationship status (married, divorce) you were wrong to have an affair. But you are still dating current girlfriend.... she sounds like her moral compass is skewed. If you feel relieved over the break up threats. I’m guessing you have your answer. Is this woman someone you want your children “looking up” to? I’m guessing not. Be careful who you have in your life as well as your children’s. Congrats on your new financial “freedom” but honestly. Remember what really counts. Your children and their primary caregiver. It sounds like you picked an amazing wife. And a terrible fling. Toss out the fling... i can’t believe you haven’t yet. And MAYBE you’ll one day have a chance at being a family again "
3,b43t53,t2_1726m2,wasteofthought,"NTA. You're an asshole for cheating on your ex-wife but if your gf knew about it back then, really this is just your gf having to face up to the consequences of your affair. It would partially be her fault too. Your wife shouldn't have to talk to or even like the woman that helped put a wrench in her marriage and her family and your girlfriend needs to realize that she has a part of your life and love, but no place in your FAMILY. Your ex-wife deserves this money and sounds like a fucking angel. Your girlfriend isn't entitled to shit and this decision doesn't speak to how much you love her, it speaks to how much you love your kids and their living situation with your ex. DO IT. And if your girlfriend leaves, well, you know she wasn't respectful of your family anyway. "
3,b43t53,t2_2gs3cvbp,Muddyducker,"NTA....however, your ex isn't 'letting' you see your children. Never approach it in that manner. That is mentality many of us are working very hard to change. You are their father, you have rights. Ok, things are great and that's awesome between you and ex. There's no guarantee things will always be that way. Better choice would've been to set up a trust for the kids, not a lump to the ex. If you wanted to help her in a small way, ok. But I am certain you are paying child support, courts could also be used to increase that exponentially. I think you ran fast with your emotions without putting alot of thought into it. As for the girlfriend, she has no say. You are not married and finances are separate. "
3,b43t53,t2_3fjfhgfs,popeteri,NTA your ex is very lucky to have an ex as kind and selfless as you and your gf is dta (definitely the asshole) for not understanding you wanting to give your ex a way to provide a better life for her and your children.

3,b43t53,t2_qe6y5,BlossomingPetals,"NTA, at all! It sounds like you majorly downgraded partners when you shacked up with the affair partner because her response to you is very telling of her character.

Your priorities appear to be in order. I'd let the girlfriend walk."

Buy yourself one and one for her and your kids. obviously not next door to each other but yanno. and give her a bit of money on top of it as a cushion to allow her to maybe find a better job or attend school to begin some sort of career she likes. current girlfriend should go pound sand. she sounds like a c u next thursday. sorry. oh and invest wisely for yourself and future, make the best of this opportunity. congrats "
3,b43t53,t2_r8buh,amcm67,"#NTA Your gf is being petty, jealous & selfish. You are not married to her! You owe her zero explanations when it comes to your ex-wife & children. Not showing support of your generosity - is showing her character. If I were in your shoes I would absolutely do the same thing. My ex actually donated his kidney to me and I’m 4 months post transplant. (Yay me) He cheated on me early on in our marriage and it was over for me. Despite that, after a year of processing everything - we put our differences aside for our two kids. We’ve remained friends and he celebrates with me, the boys and my family for holidays. No one is disrespecting your gf, she however is disrespecting you. "
3,b43t53,t2_15ori4,lil_bit_o_sunshine,NTA.i come from a situation like YOUR CHILDREN ARE IN. Please dont listen to the GF! Its amazing how your exwife handled breakup and never tried to hurt your relationship with you and your kids although you are with the woman who knowingly assisted you in hurting and ending your original family unit. I see nothing wrong with giving your ex wife money to help her get by and raise YOUR children. She could have went after you in the devorce out of spite and rage but she did not. Your girlfriend should have no say in what you do and privide for your children. I come from a situation just like this but without winning the money. My dad helped my mom when we where young and it helped our home life be stable and i felt secure. That is untill his wife got involved and he quit helping other than the bare minimum the court required and. He started MANY custody battles and years of anxiety because he began listening to his wife. As a child i had my first panic attack and passed out in a court room speaking with a judge and lawyers about not wanting to move over 5 hours away and away from ALL of my family and support system for the third time in like 5 years. Any harm you do to your ex wife is also done to your kids.

If it will make her feel better (and you still want to deal with her), tell her to think of it Not as giving your ex wife money, but money to your children for their care. >My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. >was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see _**our kids**_ who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible >She still is close with my parents. So in other words, _**this woman was and is still a fairly big part of your life**_. (and since you have kids, will continue to be essentially until death..) >She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. I feel that that is pretty normal based on the circumstances. (It'd be different if the gf happened after the divorce or after the gf that *caused* the divorce though) >when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I’m disrespecting her >accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife Based on how you got together, I think (hypocritically) she'll always be worried and accuse you of that. >My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. Let her go. Let her go like a dog doo bag into a park dumpster."
3,b43t53,t2_377dh1ue,MisterShape,"NTA That's the most awesome thing that you could do for her and your kids, other than be there for them. It's really like you are giving the money to her for your kids sake and well being. It's definitely a jerk move for your current girlfriend to threaten you with leaving. Which I'm sure she most likely won't follow through with. Someone that shallow and selfish will most assuredly have stars in their eyes and wanna stick around for the lifestyle afforded by having loads of cash. You're absolutely doing the right thing. "
3,b43t53,t2_12hahw,TheBigfut,"NTA. She is still the mother and caretaker of your children, so to me it makes sense to give her some money. As far as your new partner goes, I would say give her another week or so to come on board and if she's not doing so I suggest reevaluate everything. From someone that's had money it usually shows people's true intentions and nature. "
3,b43t53,t2_l48ob,shushupbuttercup,"NTA, and I obviously don't need to throw my vote in here because we're way off in that direction already. You may not see this with all of the comments already, but I wanted to throw my opinions around in regards to your gf (I'm an Internet expert who should be working, so clearly you need me). She's jealous and insecure. Those aren't necessarily bad things (who am I to judge? oh yeah, Internet expert), but it's a fact that she feels unsteady in your relationship. And with good reason: you two got together because of an affair, you were never going to end things with your wife because of the kids, PLUS you still love and respect your ex-wife, not to mention that you are definitely giving off vibes that you're emotionally disconnecting. You say you're relieved by her reaction, which means you've been feeling like getting out. I'm sorry, but there's no way she can't sense your distancing whether either of you know it's happening or not. She knows, however deep down, that you're unhappy with her. Every sign is there. So, when you say, ""Babe, I'm totes giving $4mil to my ex wife,"" she's hearing, ""Look, lady, this is mine all mine, and you have no say in my life. You and I are not partners, but my ex-wife and I will always be partners. You're the girl I fucked on the side, and you'll never be anything more, even though you stuck by me through some tough stuff and shared me with the kids, you're the side girl forever. And now I have money that's going to make my life so much easier, but you get nothing and you can stay or go, I don't care."" And there's NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU FEELING THAT WAY. But she's panicking and clinging and scared because this thing you guys have is ending and she doesn't quite know it yet but she kinda does. Be honest with her and let her go. "
3,b43t53,t2_6og1i4h,madriverdog,"NTA its your money to do with as you wish let your gf leave. she will beg to be back soon. esp. after she sees your next gf enjoy you life and new wealth also: give your kids enough to something with their lives, but not enough to do nothing with their lives"
3,b43t53,t2_38eujj21,ageralds1,"NTA- if she is who you say she is, that money will put your kids through college, buy them first cars, go into a trust for them, pay off the house they live in etc. I think if you thought she was type to just fuck it all off and start wasting it on every dang thing you probably wouldn't be as eager to give it to her. "
3,b43t53,t2_qb11i,Eyehopeuchoke,"NTA. We need to get rid of the stigma that you’re not allowed to be civil or even friends with your ex. My ex and I didn’t even have kids together, but we were together for 13 years and are still best friends even though we’ve both remarried and she even has a kid with her current husband. I would still give her a good amount of money if i won a stupid amount. It’s refreshing seeing someone else is adult enough to have that kind of relationship with their ex too. "
3,b43t53,t2_11ieja24,blackcurrantcat,"NTA. You will be forever linked to your ex-wife through your kids; your current gf and any future gfs will have to accept that. They don't have to like it but that's their choice. Your gf, as she was the one you were having the affair with at the time, was also responsible for breaking your ex-wife's heart so I think it's a bit rich (no pun intended) of her to have an issue with you wanting to give your ex some of your money. You say you won millions- is she worried there won't be enough left for her, because if she is then remind her you have won millions. But, I wonder why you're really posting? You've made your mind up to give your ex-wife some money (and I think that's the right thing to do too, and I think you're doing it for sound reasons), and you also say you're relieved that your gf is threatening to leave you over this. So, does it really matter if you're an asshole? I'm not sure who'd you be being the asshole towards. You get to give your kids and your ex-wife some of your winnings, and it kind of sounds like you'd be happier without your gf anyway. "
3,b43t53,t2_6he2r,Captcha_Imagination,"NTA Bro, not only are you not an asshole.....there's a special place in heaven for you. There is no such thing as 100% redemption from cheating but this is as close as it gets. I'm just some internet rando but i'm genuinely proud of you and so will your kids when they are old enough to understand. As for your GF.....I can imagine how intense that must be. Women are resource protectors and she is feeling like you are LOSING a bunch of money to your ex not winning millions. Maybe there is a compromise.....instead of just gifting your wife the money, you can set up a trust with her and the kids as beneficiaries. In fact that's probably a smarter move than just giving them the money. That way you can guarantee stuff like their education in the future and whatnot. You can leave instructions for the trust to be dissolved and given to your kids at a certain age. It's much healthier financially for them to get a thousand or several thousand dollars a month than to get a lump sum which might get spent quickly."
3,b43t53,t2_2orvpkti,v0ness,"Nta. Far far far from it. That's incredibly nice of you. If your GF, who you left your wife for, cannot understand the pain and strife you caused for your ex wife, than she is subhuman. I don't care how much she dislikes her. Lack of empathy tells me a lot about a person. Helping your exwife out also helps your kids out. You are still family. If your exwife and kids are struggling living on peanuts, and you change your entire family's life for the better. "
3,b43t53,t2_2qwwz0a7,empressofdogs,"NTA — it’s your money, you still care about your ex, and it would be a kind and generous thing to do. I don’t want to “lay into” your girlfriend here, but you might consider couples’ counseling if you want to stay together. That she can’t see your perspective on this seems like a pretty big hurdle to overcome without a neutral third party to mediate. "
3,b43t53,t2_ft9pwld,OneRunTwo,"NTA, by gifting some of that money to your ex wife youre ensuring they are very well taken care of. Your gf is being nasty and selfish. My friend grew up homeless and in trailer park while his dad lived in a giant mansion with his new wife and his new baby son. My friend grew up in a bad area rarely seeing his wealthy father, friend ended up on drugs and in prison. I just imagine how different he could have turned out had he not had such a rough life not seeing his mom bc shes working 2 jobs and not seeing his dad bc his step mom was a spoiled rotten step monster who didnt want him in his fathers home. My point is I just cant imagine not taking care of your kids &, the mother of your children especially if on good terms & youre the reason the marriage ended. Money changes things, it provides opportunity & a better spring board to success. Dont deprive your kids of that, they should have that at moms home too. Good on you. Gf sounds immature and petty, make sure she treats your kids well behind closed doors when youre not there bc kids often dont tell when step mom is awful to them Also CONGRATS i hope you read that post on the lottery curse and how to avoid it. Edit also i highly doubt gf is going to break up, she wants that money lol. You however should bc if youre feeling relieved over the threats theres some thing wrong"
3,b43t53,t2_tjl1lzb,crinnaursa,"NTA there is more then one type of love. Just because there is currently no romantic love does not mean there is no love. If you define love is wishing the best for another even at personal cost it still sounds like you do love your ex-wife and your children. If your girlfriend can't understand that she has a very undeveloped understanding of what love is. She sounds like she is rather insecure. And holding onto a US vs them attitude. It's unhealthy for her to see your past relationship as a competition. I'm not trying to disparage her but I see this is a test of her character. If she can't come to the understanding that she must share you with your past I don't see how she can engage in a loving, unselfish, and stable relationship. She needs to exhibit some personal growth. My mother and father both had a tumultuous relationship that was highly dysfunctional, it included cheating, and ultimately ended in divorce. But I do believe they still love each other even if they are poison to each other in a relationship. Many years after the divorce my father married another woman. They became great friends and called themselves sisters. His new wife was stricken with cancer and my mother was there to help as much as she could and still supported my father when his wife lost her battle with cancer. This is your money you have not entered into a contract with your girlfriend to share finances you can do, with it, whatever you feel. Understand that money and expose very nasty behavior."
3,b43t53,t2_9di0tqa,Porcupine98,"First let me put your girlfriends perspectives here: Your girlfriend is upset because you're talking about giving an ex, who you married, and had kids with and were madly in love with, a large sum of money. She could be thinking ""He won the lottery... That's a lot of money... Proposal? Trip?"" Then she hears about your ex wife. I don't blame her for being upset (though I myself wouldn't expect a proposal or anything out of my boyfriend winning the lottery. I'd expect him to buy a bunch of camera and computer equipment amd maybe him taking me out to a nice dinner at best.) Your ex wife sounds like a sweetheart. I'm so happy you guys still make a sort of friendship work, and that you know you messed up in the past. You are also a father and having KIDS is most important financially. You can put the money towards their college. Your girlfriend doesn't understand that kids are expensive and you technically should be paying for half of the expenses as you are the father. So NTA, you're an angel it seems. Wish my exes were as considerate as you!"
3,b43t53,t2_1nbtmclq,annbeagnach,NTA That’s rich - she was the other woman disrespecting the marriage and breaking up the family. SMH It’s wonderful if you to want to make up for some of your kid’s mom’s difficulties and fitting that the one that destroyed her life is livid. Maybe there is karma for some after all.
3,b43t53,t2_icjhc,slickwillytfcf,"NTA. First off, it's your goddamn money, fuck what your girlfriend thinks. You could go drop $20k on whores and blow today and she shouldn't say shit. If she wants to leave let her - she's replaceable. She shouldn't be pissed, and you shouldn't feel like an asshole, because you're ensuring your kids have a great place to grow up while they're with their mom. Girlfriend needs to get off her high horse regarding respect since she severely disrespected your wife by having the affair in the first place. If anyone is the asshole it's her."
3,b43t53,t2_jbdn2uh,Ms1776,"NTA. Although I have to say after reading some of your comments, it's pretty disappointing the way you have allowed your girlfriend to talk about your children - especially over money which she is NOT entitled to. If a significant other ever called my children ""spoiled idiots"" because I wanted to make sure the parent of my child was taken care of after showing such forgiveness towards me and love towards our kid, that person's A$$ would be out the door and their number would be blocked. "
3,b43t53,t2_gzmzc,jcb42,"NTA. You are allowed to have a significant relationship with your ex-wife without being in love with her. You can consider her family and love her as a person. My parents did this and it was a wonderful thing to grow up with. My father gave my mom money because she did not have a high paying job, and they were NOT in love with each other at all. I get your gf feeling insecure, but she needs to get over it. This is the mother of your children and an important person in your life. If she can't handle that, that's her problem."
3,b43t53,t2_oojvo,CaptainCortes,"NTA. It’s unfair to your children and ex wife if you give them an amazing life from your side and send them back to your ex who is doing her best to keep afloat. It doesn’t mean you owe her any money, it just means that this gives them the best opportunity in life and lowers the risk of them favouring you over her just because you have money. This is a wonderful gift to give and even a small amount can give you all a better life. She’ll be able to work less so she can spend more time raising your wonderful children. A happy mum and dad greatly influence children in a good way. It’s not your girlfriends money. You don’t owe any one anything. "
3,b43t53,t2_mtu5nfo,ConsterMock93,"NTA. You sound like a great dad and I wish there were more dads who still care about their children as much as you do after a divorce. Probably helps that your ex didnt try to get sole custody and didnt make it a hard divorce, but still, sounds like you're being a good dad to me and paying back for mistakes you made in this past which is AOK in my book. Also you said ""My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats"". Sounds like you dont really want to be with your current girlfriend or dont really care either way if you're together or not....RUN WITH YOUR MONEY BEFORE SHE TRYS TO GET SOME OF IT FOR HERSELF!!!"
3,b43t53,t2_mrgpd,nomnommish,"YTA. Everyone on this thread is jumping to a conclusion that your GF is being a gold-digger. But in all honesty, all the things you have mentioned in your post clearly shows that your GF is firmly a second priority for you. 1. You called your ex before you called your GF! 2. You said multiple glowing praise-worthy things about your ex, and said zero positive things about your GF. 3. You say you don't love your ex and only respect her, but you say, ""I still love her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids"". On top of it, you clearly have no respect for your GF. You've been with her for 6 years and haven't married her or got engaged. You also say, ""My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. "" 4. To be crystal clear, you said in a reply that ""both you and your GF were disrespectful to your ex for cheating on your ex"". No, you were the cheat and were disrespectful. Your GF wasn't married to your ex, nor (i am assuming) did she have a relationship with your ex before or during the cheating phase. Your'e a grown-ass man and you made your decision to cheat on your ex. Don't drag your GF into your sins. She was free to sleep and have a relationship with any other reciprocating adult and she did. She didn't betray anyone else (at least that we know of from your info) Now having said all this, this is your money. These are your kids. And what you do with your money is your decision. Yours alone. But let's call a spade a spade. You're clearly being disrespectful to your GF. You're treating her like dirt even though she has stuck around with you for 6 years. She is still a clear second priority for you. Remember, respect is 90% of love and you don't even respect your GF. You're clearly TA here. Stop treating your GF like this. Either she is your #1 priority or she is not. If she is not, have the courage to let her go so she can recover and then find someone who will treat he better. And to be extra clear, I still support your decision to give your ex that money. I will say you should give your ex some of the money so she can improve her lifestyle, and the rest you should structure into a trust fund that your kids can access when they are adults. Don't just give a lumpsum. Or better still, structure a trust fund that invests this money into dividend and interest generating blue chip stocks and bonds, and pays out the interest money to your wife every month. That way, your wife (oops, ex) will get a steady source of income and doesn't have to go through the headache or risk of investing a giant sum of money and then risk losing it all on a bad investment. And the principle money still remains untouched and will appreciate as the value of the blue chip stocks also appreciate over time. But for heaven's sake, think about your GF too. She is also your priority - she has spent a significant part of her life with you. She has dreams and aspirations of having a future with you. Stop being an asshole to her. Either treat her really well or let her go."
3,b43t53,t2_348k211,phantomstrange,"NTA for wanting to provide for the mother of your children, which is the question you asked. YTA for everything relating to your gf. Not only did you cheat on your wife, the mother of your children, you also allowed your gf to think she's entitled to a say in whether, and how, you provide for your children and their mother. Providing for your ex wife in this way better enables her to care for your children in the time that they are with her. The fact that your new gf is mad about that should give you major red flags (on top of the one where she helped you destroy your marriage)."
3,b43t53,t2_13y1hn,TechnoT1ger,"NTA. Obviously you need to go over some insecurities your gf has within your relationship dealing with your ex-wife. If not insecurities, then jealousy and controlling. But I don't know your gf so I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt.

3,b43t53,t2_ay75uug,sharkieclarkie,"NTA. My ex husband is the beneficiary of my life insurance because our daughter is still young and he will need it to raise her. You can see that it will help give your children a better life and opportunities as well as make her happier which in turn directly affects the children and their lives. I think your motivations are a little selfish, that you’re wanting to give it to her as some kind of redemption from the pain you caused, but I can get that too. Still not assholey. Your gf will still benefit. You’ll do things together and buy things for you both and probably get her a present so it’s not like you’re excluding her completely. Good plan, and good of you to do. "
3,b43t53,t2_384xiugt,rainydayready,NTA. You're showing how much you've grown and how much you NOW respect your ex wife even if you didn't when you were together. If she's an excellent mom to your kids then taking the financial burden off her is a generous thing to do. I think your current GF has some of her own growing up to do and you should think really hard about how you want to spend the rest of your days and who you spend them with. Life is short and if it makes you feel good do it but respect and the example you set for your children reaches beyond you and now. Congratulations.
3,b43t53,t2_1pia4wuf,itsmynewusername,"That is so awesome. Good for you. I say NTA. With the Powerball so high rn, I've been daydreaming about what I'd do without the jackpot. Definitely giving my ex and his gf a huge chunk of it. My husband probably wouldn't love it, but we share a child who goes back and forth, I get along great with his gf, and my kid has siblings over there. I honestly feel like they're just somewhere between immediate and extended family. But we live in a nicer area, they don't see my kid as much bc they have to work all the time, and the drive back and forth is annoying, for everyone including the kid. If they lived closer, they'd be in a nice area, close to our kid, and could work less to have more time with our kid. I guess I'm just concerned for my kid, but if they are happy and safe and well off, so is my kid when he's with them. I'd probably buy them a house is what I'm thinking lol. So if you're the asshole, so am I. "
3,b43t53,t2_1t0jh1ac,Jorb985,"NTA - You are being incredibly generous and I will assume that even after your gift to your ex, you will still be comfortable financially as a result of your windfall. Chances are, legally speaking, she could come back at you in court seeking alterations to any child support or alimony arrangements you already have in place so you're probably well on your way to getting ahead of that. Your gf is being ridiculous. You'll still be well off enough. Shes being greedy. Do what you like with your money but be prepared for her to walk, sounds like you might be better off, who knows?"
3,b43t53,t2_7g2q9,teeleer,"NTA from the sounds of it, the money would also help your kids have a more even life since there wouldn't be as large of a burden on your ex wife to help raise the kids and make transitions from staying at your house or hers on the days each of you take care of the kids"

He called our house and got my 12y brother, then me (15y) and had no moral issue with involving us because he wanted us to tell my Dad. My Mom hung around for awhile, arranged to take our best furniture, then bailed with the guy she cheated with . In fact she didnt tell my Dad, told me then left me to tell everyone. Despite all this, in the divorce my Dad made sure she got her half of everything, even the awesome retirement plan he had which was a bitch for accountants and lawyers to figure out. I was so angry at my Mom. I said why are you going to so much trouble for her? He said, she stayed home and took care of us for 16 years, gave me my beautiful kids, and raised them to be good people. I owe her at least this. He was a better person than I, and you are trying to be too. I get that some people, not very good people, might use it to needle her about whether your relationship isnt secure, but that is the thinking of petty people. Showing respect for the Mother of your children doesnt take respect away from anyone else. Be the good person and if she doesnt like it, bye Felicia."
3,b43t53,t2_169kkv2x,idkijustwanna,NTA what you are doing is really good and although nothing can really be enough to say sorry for cheating this will definatly show her that you know what you did was a mistake and still love her.

It’s none of my business how much you won, but as you stated, it’s a life changing amount. I commend you for being willing to share this bounty with your ex wife. As I stated you are not an asshole. I feel like when large sums of money are involved it tends to bring out the polar extremes in people. You are not just giving this money to your ex but also and importantly your giving this money to your children too. This money will help ensure they live a consistent lifestyle between homes. Your girlfriend is likely expressing her frustration and what will likely always be an issue for her, that being your relationship with your ex wife. She’s expressing her insecurities and it is what it is. How you choose to soothe the situation is up to you. I won’t pretend to be Dr. Phil and tell you how to proceed in your relationship but I feel like you should totally give your ex the money. "
3,b43t53,t2_2lk7w7kr,WriteAway1,"NTA. It’s refreshing to see someone willing to share their good fortune with their ex, and be so happy about it! I’ve heard a lot of stories from men who’ve taken extraordinary steps to cheat their exes out of child support (working a low wage job to keep their child support order low instead of working at their union trade career; having their supplementary income paid under a relative’s social security number, etc.). Kudos for being stand up! "
3,b43t53,t2_bch9f,pinksultana,"NTA Of course you want to give some cash to your ex and it enables her to provide amazing things for your kids and give them a good life. I can understand the girlfriend may feel a bit unsure but tbh (no disrespect) but it would be hard to feel trusting of a partner when a relationship is begun as an affair, doesn’t mean you are u trustworthy but she might just be feeling unsure and need your reassurance in this and time to understand it."
3,b43t53,t2_255ki882,Hrilmitzh,"NTA, your side piece turned gf is projecting since she knows you cheated with her, probably paranoid of it happening to her now. Hopefully she gives her head a shake and understands your kids come first, and that will end up including their mother."

I think what you are doing is very generous, and I think I know you fucked up with the affair, but you have a good understanding of what you put your ex-wife and that is often lacking on the part of people who make mistakes. Give your girlfriend time to calm down, but she also has to understand that you still have two kids with your ex-wife, and that money could set those children up for great educations, and a removal of some stress and worry for both you and your ex-wife as parents. "
3,b43t53,t2_622xz,frumpyballerina,"NTA. BTW, your girlfriend won't break up with you in spite of her threats. You are now *stupid rich.* Unfortunately, this means people will want to be in relationships with you just for the money. (Like Ivanka Trump?) Her being upset about this and being willing to be involved in an affair with a married man (you're only of the hook with me because you believe it was a mistake) says something about her character. If it were me, I'd dump her. And I would avoid telling future girlfriends about the money for as long as you can. It makes me happy you would do this for your ex and kids."
3,b43t53,t2_3fdl1w4r,Elegant-Despair,"NTA. When it comes down to it, she’s the mother of your children and she cares for them on a regular basis. Deciding to give her money is completely rational, and it’s nice to hear exes getting along well enough that you would do that. Also it’s your money, and current partner isn’t your wife. And if she can’t understand giving money to the mother of your children, it wouldn’t be a loss to lose her. "
3,b43t53,t2_2s2xr1o5,drunkonoldcartoons,NTA. More divorced parents need to still have good relationships like this. It is incredible that you are doing this. I say trash the girlfriend for being so mad and money hungry that she thinks it's a personal attack to give some to your ex and your kids. 
3,b43t53,t2_4axzx,seedypete,"**NTA**. Not only that, you’re a genuinely good guy who is doing a good thing and deserve to be lauded for it. Something you understand and your girlfriend may not is that having an ex with whom you share kids who is reasonable and accommodating is goddamned **priceless**. Beyond priceless! She could have very easily burned your life to the ground and made it absolute hell to see your kids, but she didn’t. My wife’s ex-husband is a complete bastard and you would be astounded how many creative ways he’s come up with to mess with her life, mess with mine, and worst of all mess with their son. A vindictive ex spouse is a level of hell most people can’t imagine and yours actually had a pretty good reason to be vindictive but wasn’t, unlike ours who is just an scumbag in general. I’m a bit reluctant to call your girlfriend the asshole here, though. To be honest given the circumstances in which you two got together I can understand her being incredibly paranoid and defensive when it comes to your ex wife. It’s not fair to your ex at all, but it’s not unexpected either. From her POV she probably sees this as you thinking she was a mistake and buying your way back into your ex’s good graces, rather than the sincere atonement and thank you it seems to be. Cut her a little slack on her reaction as long as she calms down. If she follows through with her threat, well, no big loss from the sound of things. "
3,b43t53,t2_2xqam0gz,fakearies1,"Nta but her reaction although immature is understandable. Tell her it's for your kids and not your ex wife. Or just give it to them if they are old enough. Btw, the affair is a thing of the past. Yeah affairs ain't good but we arent OP's ex wife. So we should get off our moral high horse here. Because you two were a product of affairs, and you're a divorcee who's amicable with the ex, she's always gonna be insecure. She needs to learn how to deal with it and you need to know how to assure her. Last but a really important point... How much you giving your gf? Could it be she's jealous because you giving your ex wife more? "
3,b43t53,t2_koj4axl,AtypicalAshley,"YTA for not at least letting your gf know, also there are better ways to give money to your ex or at least your children without just giving them straight cash. Start a trust fund so you know it’s going to benefit them, especially your children. Even if you did your ex wrong, it doesn’t mean she will spend the money right. I’ll be honest if I was your long term gf I would be upset too. If my boyfriend told one of his exes he dated for a few years before he told me, I was be confused and upset. If he gave her a large sum of money without telling me I would be even more confused and upset. I understand wanting them, especially your children, to live comfortably but you could have done it a better way. Also, money can not right the wrong you did. You need to focus on your children, not fixing a mistake that happened a long time ago. "

My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. Please, for your kids' sake, make sure she can't make any kind of claim to what is ultimately their inheritance, since she's clearly not necessarily the most mature person in the world when it comes to money or relationships. > I don’t plan on changing my plans, but AITA? No. You're being a good father by making sure your kids and their mother have some stability and breathing room. That should have been your priority all along, but like they say: ""The best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago, the second best is today."" If the kids continue to be the priority, you'll be a much better father than a lot of children grow up with. "
3,b43t53,t2_zrsah,L_Earl,"NTA. Your current wife is the asshole though. It is awesome to hear you have that kind of respect for the mother of your kids, and you are right, it took a lot for her to maintain co-parenting in that situation, and it sounds like she would benefit from the money and you would still be quite well off while making her life better too."
3,b43t53,t2_14xxxc,synesthesiah,"NTA. My husband’s family won a similar “fuck you” amount of money a few years back. Both me and my husband (not married at the time) got a *little* crazy over it and the prospect of our lives changing. We were assholes and treated each other like dirt. Constant bickering, demeaning behaviour, making demands. Unfortunately, money does that. Fortunately, we got over ourselves. Your gf may, or may not. If the relationship goes south, be prepared to part with some of your dough if you’re common law depending on your local laws. I hope you’re confident in your lawyer because money draws all sorts of people out of the woodwork. We’ve had a successful transition, but it is definitely jarring and nothing is the same. Best of luck to you! "

3,b43t53,t2_2hhlzm4n,RadioSupply,"NTA, but you should make it clear that you are entrusting her with the money to be put towards the children. They are being raised by a single mother, and you love them. They existed before your girlfriend, and you have a responsibility towards them which you are honouring (good job, Dad!) Is it possible to arrange to put the bulk of the funds you intend for them in an educational/21yrs trust? Of course you can and should splash out on a treat for them now, if you want to spread your happiness to them, but it will be so useful later, too. Your gf can be mad, but she chose to be with someone who has children. That means that you prioritize the children, who rely on you as their parent. They will go to university and/or trade school someday, or need a car, or need that last chunk of cash towards a downpayment on a home. You are responsible to them financially - not to her."

Assuming she doesn't break it off, I would expect there to be a monetary value attached to your relationship. Ie you gave your ex this much, so you better give me this much.

Despite the fact that he left me paying for everything I gave him dollars on the house settlement. Partially to leave me alone forever, partially because I needed him to cool but the other part was to give him a chance to start with something, despite me being left with not much. My boyfriend decided that he was ok when our finances became linked because regardless of anything I would not screw him over. Your girlfriend wants you to screw over the mother of your children. Not much respect or trust. She should be looking at the behaviour as a positive "

It sounds like there were lots of red flags before you found out about the cheating and she treated you like crap...I’m sorry about that. I’m sure it’s rough. IMO: breaks are tricky and it’s important to clarify the boundaries if you’re going to do it. She said you’d still be dating but none of the romantic stuff so that, to me, means you were still together and she shouldn’t have been screwing other people.

ESPECIALLY in a situation like this where you are stripping and getting a physical. It's a pretty big red flag there. ADDITIONALLY OP YOU DO NOT JUST GO TO PICK UP PILLS AND END UP WITH A PHYSICAL! NEITHER DO YOU END UP WITH A DOUBLE PHYSICAL OF BOTH YOU AND YOUR STEP DAD! Physicals are done with your GP and are scheduled appointments. They are not just done ad-hoc when you're picking up pills from the pharmacy or getting a refill. You don't get a 30 minute physical during a 15 minute appointment to refill a prescription. Seriously, wtf."

But I realized it's because she just had a hard time understanding that I wasn't a little kid anymore. Your stepdad's response was maybe a little mean, and I don't know the whole context of your relationship with him, but he probably just doesn't realize the importance of your privacy. If you approach the topic in a reasonable way with him (before he sees you naked again), and just talk about how you're a teen, he might get the idea."

It doesn’t matter what you used to do, you have a right to your boundaries, and it’s not unreasonable to want privacy from everyone except the doctor when getting a physical. Walking around in underwear as a kid is in no way equivalent to being medically examined while barely clothed or naked. This equivalency your stepdad is assuming places you in an unfair situation where you’re expected to ignore your own discomfort, and that’s not fair to you. I don’t understand why he didn’t leave. If he was concerned about your safety, he could always ask you afterwards if everything went okay. What a jerk."

This sounds like what his deal is. That being said, I understand people not wanting to get undressed in front of me. Sounds like his brain hasn't completely transitioned you away from kid to teenager. I don't find his behavior weird, but his refusal to leave is lame.

That does seem odd to me that you didn’t know you were supposed to get one, I’m protective though and wouldn’t want anything to happen to a child I’m left in charge of. Maybe ask him why he didn’t leave the room like you asked and if his reasoning isn’t valid, explain your discomfort. "

You are making this entirely about you. You say you are not feeling valued. I guarantee she's feeling the same way. You are mad because she didn't cave.

'We were too early for me to complain about it' No- kids come under core values which are the things that need to be known at the beginning of a serious relationship.

Any upset on this topic further down the line is your fault. 'She doesn't understand how important siblings are.' Please check your implied expertise on this topic (which also reads as so patronising). She has experience of raising a child when you don't. She has been developing parental judgement for EIGHT YEARS so she is qualified to decide whether her kid 'needs' a sibling. This is flawed logic anyway- siblings are not inherently important. All you know is that you liked having yours, and maybe some other anecdotal evidence. Plenty people are not close to siblings. You talk about her having a kid 'for you'. You aren't entitled to have anyone pregnant for 9 months, go through a painful and maybe dangerous labour, then co-raise a child they don't want. Check your privilege. The only reason women should get pregnant is that they actually want to parent and are willing to undergo the ravaging of pregnancy and childbirth to their body. You don't get a say in whether they should or shouldn't. You got butthurt when you tried to manipulate her passive-aggressively and she called you on it, admirably sticking to her core values?

You doubt her autism (let me see your degree before you go saying she doesn’t have something that a doctor already confirmed) you call her names, and you’d rather control her by force rather than be open to listening. Kids who fall victim to predators often were just looking for someone to talk to that they could trust, who would be kind and listen patiently. She’s looking for older men to replace you, because you are not the type of father she needs. You are the stupid one. You are not helping the situation, you are making it so much worse. You need to get counseling for yourself, as well as family counseling for you, your daughter AND your ex so you can constructively deal with this situation AS a team. A team meaning the THREE of you, not your ex and you vs your daughter, not the three of you against each other. If you are unable to do this, then you need to let your ex have full custody for the sake of your daughter, because you are going to destroy her emotionally.

Taking away a bedroom door is not related to talking to bad people online, and when you want to teach kids a lesson, you have to do it in a way that relates to the problem. This crosses the line. She is probably feeling lonely and likely has low self esteem. Girls around that age typically have a lot of self esteem issues (I definately did), and will look for attention where they can get it. Try addressing those issues instead of trying to ban her from contacting these predators. Taking her door, electronics, internet, etc. will all end with her resenting you guys and wanting to contact them more. Address the underlying issues (and do what you can to protect her, like keeping an eye on her so you know she's not meeting anyone. safety is important.)"

"
3,ag9jwg,t2_7ua8i,Melmoe,NTA for wanting to have your ex take off the door. It is understandable however it will do nothing but encourage further rebellion from her. She needs to be in therapy and the restrictions on electronics needs to resume indefinitely. She needs to show that she is not putting her life and safety at risk and she needs to understand what is at risk. You may want to reach out to your local police department and discuss services that can help prevent her behavior. I am wondering if they can work with you on giving her some insight on how dangerous her behavior is and what it can lead to. My personal belief is that they have no right to privacy when they cannot be trusted to make the right choices. I don't have a daughter but I am a daughter and was a very rebellious teenager. She will not fair well if you are lenient and give her too many chances to prove you right. 
3,ag9jwg,t2_2wt68k77,WellLatteDa,"NTA, because I understand you're trying to get across to her some sort of really jarring consequence for her behavior. Unfortunately, taking off doors is usually reserved for kids who are doing something sneaky in their rooms and a lack of privacy is the best way to ensure it doesn't keep happening. You've taken away the tools with which she was doing the sneaky behavior, so the door thing serves no real purpose and won't do anything to make the behavior improve. If it was my kid, I'd be making her volunteer somewhere to give her something else to do than be obsessed with electronic relationships with creeps. If she likes animals, have her volunteer at an animal shelter. If she likes to read, she volunteers at the library. It's OK (and desirable) to have her enjoy what she does because your intent is to redirect her more than punish her. And by the way, she did something stupid -- REALLY, dangerously stupid. Don't listen to these people telling you that you called her stupid and now you're a bad parent. Her actions were monumentally stupid, and there's nothing wrong with letting her know that."

So why didn't your husband entertain them while you did the food prep (nothing wrong with this when the guests are from out of town, this is to be expected)?

Unless they have zero social sense I am sure they didn’t mean to intrude, for most people leaving at 7pm would leave you the evening. However being a parent I know that 7pm with a newborn can feel like 11. Best case is firmly define the time (i.e. if you want them gone by 5 pm then say 5pm, and then remind them if they aren’t packing up, If that doesn’t work, set stronger boundaries and hold them accountable, we had to do this with a set of grandparents. Honestly it worked better for all after that as they could visit and enjoy time and did t have to suffer the awkward goodbye), and they became self aware of how much impact even a quick stop has.

Genital herpes is genital herpes in that someone who gets it unexpectedly without warning isn't going to give much of a damn about the differences between hsv1 and 2. Not having contact during an outbreak is a good practice to maintain, but it doesn't get you out of disclosing. Someone I know got hsv1 on their genitals, they suspect, from a partner going down on them with a cold sore. The difference didn't matter to them a bit. I'd almost maybe get it if you just got cold sores on your mouth, but you do get it on your genitals, so you need to handle discussion of it the same as you would HSV2. There's some cognitive dissonance in your reasoning here. If your reason for not having the conversation is that it's not a big deal, then it shouldn't be a big deal to have the conversation. The reason it's going to be a big deal *now* is that you didn't tell him in the first place. I have HSV2. The partner I got it from told me before things got sexual between us. I have maintained the same practice with every partner I've had since. I have never, ever been turned down because of it, but if I had been, that would have been fair. I consider it part of informed consent because I know it could have an impact on their choice to have sex with me. You don't get to decide whether or not it's a big deal to them.

That has been going on for awhile and finally came to a head when you met someone else. People who think “talking about day to day things is pointless” are frustrating and pretentious. Not every conversation is some profound journey into the philosophical interpretations of the universe. Sometimes conversations are about how dumb Karen in marketing was today, or how your neighbor brought over some banana bread. If you two aren’t together for months at a time, the day to day stuff is important to fill each other in on, it keeps the relationship healthy during long distance periods, so that even when you aren’t together, you’re still part of each other’s lives.
