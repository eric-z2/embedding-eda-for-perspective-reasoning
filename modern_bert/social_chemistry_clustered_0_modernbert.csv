0,a73l8g,t2_o8utf,PreOpTransCentaur,"NTA for whatever, having feelings I guess, but kind of the asshole for struggling with money consistently and still trying to procreate. Also, adoption is *extremely* fucking pricy. You'd be getting off light with a 5k IVF treatment. Trust me."
0,ax9t4t,t2_16cvlk,LowRentMegazord,Yta. I'm shocked your school condones cuntery of this kind.
0,aeaw4t,t2_1bq7n5z8,s10ppypanda,"NTA. This is silly. “American” is the commonly-accepted demonym for people from the U.S. across many languages. Also, just because they could technically call themselves American as well (using a broader definition) doesn’t make you NOT an American, so they shouldn’t have any problem with you using the term. "
0,aeaw4t,t2_b2m2c,neonsaber,"NTA, these people who call you out.... aren't very smart. People don't usually describe themselves by the *continent* they're from. "
0,aeaw4t,t2_1i7ac391,PracticingGrammarian,"Spoiler Alert: The United States is in America too. You (and they) are Americans. Though, as many have stated, “America” is very commonly used across the globe to refer to the U.S. NTA. Why shouldn’t you say you’re American? "
0,aeaw4t,t2_ftm8gi6,SomeDumbGamer,"NTA, the only reason we call ourselves Americans is because their is literally no good alternative. United-Statesian doesn’t exactly have the same ring to it."
0,aeaw4t,t2_10to0e,MildredNatwick,"NTA, they're making a silly argument that ignores the way language works, esp. since there's no subsitute in the English language that you could alternately use to describe your nationality. What, are you supposed to say, ""I'm a United States of American""? "
0,adwxny,t2_18a48bu0,kwneumann,YTA. Moving is a big decision and most people do math and planning *before* making a big decision. So that they don't change their minds a month before the deadline. 
0,a4hfkv,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,"NTA. I think you're just a typical teenager who's not 100% in to family traditions anymore. That's pretty normal. Your mom sounds a bit nutty. She should do things because she wants to, not to get anyone's appreciation, recognition, etc. "
0,acq804,t2_2u5xpl8e,weird_flex_buto_k,NTA. Just dumb af. Your gf overreacts way too much. Also the song lyrics were so cringe she probably thinks you’re dense for not being sincere.
0,amv8ew,t2_31gbxfnr,6misscamino,"NTA-Go early (don't tell anyone) give him his gift ( have him open it) give him a hug, AND LEAVE. Grandpa's been dealing with these wars longer than you, he'll understand. "
0,b2yfsl,t2_50suk2j,ErrantJune,"NTA. On top of being really un-neighborly, they're putting their dogs at risk. Dogs that run free are at a higher risk for wildlife attack, getting hit by cars, and theft. They're lucky you're just contacting the HOA. In a lot of places letting your dogs off leash is a [misdemeanor crime](https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/is-having-your-dog-off-leash-really-a-misdemeanor--447700.html)."

0,b64cu1,t2_16dl9v,sporadiccatlady,"NTA. In the bus driver's defense, buses take a hell of a lot longer to stop than a car. He should know that and cover his brake long BEFORE an intersection. "
0,azzate,t2_1t2fmzsq,waywardwinchesters79,"NTA. Uwu they’re all so special and clever, because they are learning a useless, dead language! Such a brilliant life skill! No need to learn other stupid, alive languages with people that actually speak it. Who would do such a thing? ^/s"
0,9vrn0i,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"YTA. 100%. It's her body and you dont need to KNOW when she does ANYTHING to it. You sound incredibly controlling and that's not okay. And even though youre claiming she doesnt need ""your permission"" you still ""had a problem"" not knowing ahead of time?"
0,ava5fh,t2_2cgszi17,CadetPOFromHell,"NTA. Childhood indoctrination, stripping kids of critical thinking, denying them education because of Sky Daddy is borderline abusive/cultlike. I normally I have no problem with religion, but forcing it on children is wrong on so many levels."
0,ava5fh,t2_3nlbwy,kuezaun,NTA. Raising 5 little kids is not an easy task. You don't owe anything to her or these kids. Sorry you're caught in the middle like this
0,ava5fh,t2_xgg9i,oscillius,YTA- because your anti-religion has become anti-family. You can dislike religion and still be there for religious family. You suck. My condolences to Ada.
0,ava5fh,t2_11djdr,WhatD0thLife,NTA if she wants them raised in a religious household so bad why not send the to their grandparents?
0,a1i9np,t2_2iroygxp,it_snow_problem,"NTA. People who book destination weddings _and_ expect people to come at their expense are assholes. Save your money, say you wish you could be there but can't make it. It takes a serious lack of empathy to expect anyone to drop $2000 to attend your wedding."

0,a8xtll,t2_ebqfpe,Watsonmolly,"NTA - everyone has bought our son Christmas gifts and it seems so unnecessary, he’s less than 2 weeks old. It seems mad to me. "
0,a8xtll,t2_w97pyo1,AmbulanceDriver3,"NTA. Of course, this is coming from someone who checked out of Christmas gift giving/receiving about 8 years ago and never looked back; so perhaps I don't have the most universally applicable opinion. "
0,b6i6nc,t2_5dgpq7s,Tales_of_reddit,"NTA Your advice didn't come from a place of malice or willful ignorance. If anything, she could do more to help you understand what she's going through."
0,b6i6nc,t2_anr3c,throwitouts,"NTA, your friend is being overly dramatic when you had a legitimate question/suggestion. It’s easy to say that you were insensitive/ignorant, but your friend needs to use a little sense to see that you were genuinely trying to help/understand, and that it wasn’t an excuse for them to play the victim. "
0,b6i6nc,t2_2fetmmc,donkeynique,"YTA. If you had simply asked why she does it, I'd be firmly NAH. But you do not get to tell her how to identify herself when the fact that she *is* trans is important to her. Listen first, advise second, but do not instruct unprompted."
0,b6i6nc,t2_17v15f6,min6char,"YTA. As a general rule, unless they're literally lying, it's a bad look to tell someone what they get to call themselves."

0,b67ghb,t2_r91kw5d,rotti5115,"NTA...family First? Why? Does the family pay the bills? No, longterme its the best you Can do for your family to go to work. He wont remember and when hes older might understand and be thankful for the life you provided for him. Edit: why the shortage on workers? Fired?"
0,b67ghb,t2_kw1fb,GrammarKamikaze,I'm going to say YTA but only because my dad missed my first birthday for work and always says he regrets it. Don't do that to yourself.

0,ba3zvb,t2_1hpot4wa,roarlikealady,"YTA here. Spouses stick up for their spouses, especially on topics like this. And it sounds like you are making wild assumptions about how your wife feels in her own body. "
0,b7gf0q,t2_2bpuuiv0,inevitablegirlie,"NTA. A 31 year old who is dating a 17 year old is highly likely to be a predator even if they HAVEN'T been convicted of a violent sexual crime. To a normal 31-year-old, a 17-year-old IS. A. CHILD. I can't see how that could be a relationship of equals."
0,b6kwb4,t2_i179ola,HannahToddy,NTA. Doesn’t matter what they speak in. It’s inappropriate! Yes it’s probably something she does to help her with stress. But she shouldn’t get away with it if it’s in another language.
0,b6kwb4,t2_21frwxhb,IamTheDarkAgent,NTA - If she is that unhappy with her job she should be working elsewhere.
0,b6kwb4,t2_dn9au,Swiollvfer,"NTA. If you don't want her fired, don't report her to her manager, tho. IMHO this would be the most likely outcome. Maybe tell her something like ""a lot of people who don't look Korean can actually understand Korean""? (in Korean)"
0,b6kwb4,t2_1rlqmeir,a1337sti,"NTA the business owner deserves to know that their employee is ""going rogue"" , how else will they fix the problem?"
0,b6kwb4,t2_o8il6,CarbonKat,"NTA, but without risking her job making a snide reply in Korean could cause her to knock it off."
0,b6kwb4,t2_3h047o88,Lizlizlizzyliz,"NTA. Just to really clarify, you won’t be putting her at the risk of getting her fired. Her behavior did that. You making the behavior known is not the problem. "
0,b6kwb4,t2_2rgno31v,Ejjdkdjdjdkdkw,NTA duh Though it would be funny if a customer could understand it - the cashier would be on reddit posting on r/TIFU for getting fired.
0,b01xst,t2_3y4bf,shamechisel,NTA - it sounds like your girlfriend was jealous and was being insecure. I would go to another meet-up.
0,b01xst,t2_2qwwz0a7,empressofdogs,NTA -- I know a woman like this. She married a man with the personality of a cardboard box because she ALWAYS shines brightly compared to him. 
0,b01xst,t2_1j9g4ewu,cnw19,NTA. There was a topic you enjoyed and it’s not like you took over HER conversation. I agree you just took her pep talk and ran with it! Congrats for feeling comfortable in a social setting! 
0,b01xst,t2_5e8nc,Torger083,"NTA. Ditch her and keep the friends. Joking aside, it’s not cool of her to try and diminish what was a big social accomplishment for you. "
0,b01xst,t2_176vp0,HazelNightengale,"NTA. The most charitable way I could spin this is that she was taken aback by the turnaround. Go to another meet-up or two, keep making the effort to include her, and if she still acts this way...well...not good."

0,9xssts,t2_100fbf,Thriftyverse,NTA You an break up with someone for any reason you want. You picked a good one - how do they treat people who are less fortunate than themselves?
0,9xssts,t2_68q1k,JackLove,I would be horrified myself. That's unacceptable behaviour and you don't want to be with someone who does that. Makes sense nta

Emp:4 5 6 9 11 14 17 20 21 30 32 33 34 35 37 39 40 48 50 1 2 8 12 13 15 16 Tests: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Emp: 18 19 24 25 28 29 31 36 42 43 44 45 46 49 7 23 27 38 47 3 26 41 10 22 Tests: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 &#x200B; Again, many employees never get tested, but a couple (10,22) get tested a lot. &#x200B; Sim #3: A small company (10 employees), testing 2 a month for 24 months. Emp: 4 1 3 5 9 10 7 2 **6 8** Tests:1 3 4 4 4 4 5 7 **8 8** Employees 6 and 8 might feel picked on, but it's just the random number generator getting them! &#x200B; Sim #4: 10 employees, testing half of them every month for 24 months. Emp: 7 5 6 2 10 4 8 1 3 9 Tests:6 9 10 11 12 13 13 15 15 16 Again, employees 1,3, and 9 are outliers. &#x200B; Sim #5: 10 employees, testing 80% of them each month for 24 months. Emp: 4 3 6 7 5 1 2 8 10 9 Test: 16 18 18 18 19 20 20 20 20 23 Here, you get something much closer to a uniform distribution, but there are still outliers. &#x200B; The point is that in any random process there are bound to be outliers, and trying to determine whether you are one of the outliers that is bound to occur or if there is some systematic bias in the testing process is not a trivial matter that can be done by the eyeball test. If the testing process is truly random, there will be convergence to a uniform distribution where everyone gets tested with the same relative frequency, but you will almost certainly never witness this ideal probability distribution in a small sample of tests. &#x200B;"

0,b43t53,t2_11gu69,CaptainHope93,"NTA - you gave a substantial gift to someone, that's always going to be a good thing. But honestly, the fact you're relieved about your girlfriends threats says something. Maybe you should try being single for a bit. "

0,b43t53,t2_1tl1eitl,deathrosekitty,Nta. It's your money and it is incredibly kind of you to care about the mother of your children like that. Your gf is being childish.
0,b43t53,t2_31vhn01b,dmbeeez,"NTA, your ex-wife has proven to be a principled person, and is the mother of your children. "
0,b43t53,t2_17j7r5,youridv1,"NTA - I support your decision. It helps your ex wife out and it helps your kids out. Besides, your money"
0,b43t53,t2_ctbq9tm,syd_licious89,NTA. I could see being sort of jealous and annoyed as your girlfriend but that mad? Red flag. And threatening to break up... shitty behavior. She sucks. You giving money to your ex to make her life and your kid's lives better... definitely NTA. Good on you.

0,b43t53,t2_c394y,zhohaq,NTA You are doing the right thing. Your current gf is showing her true colors. Put your foot down.If she actually leaves (which I doubt) she will be doing you a favor.

0,b43t53,t2_ntcadxf,CapitolGee34,NTA. Gf definitely isn’t breaking up with you lol especially after winning all that money. She’s most likely jealous of ex-wife but I get sense of greed too 
0,b43t53,t2_1m0qdtup,2ndChanceAtLife,"NTA - if my boyfriend showed his ex-wife that much respect, I might have hope for our future. People never realize that however the ex-spouse gets treated when things go south will be you, next time."

0,b43t53,t2_2x9u8bw4,shaa_adow,"NTA - Money ≠ Love. You've explained your reasons for wanting to give money to your Ex. If you can honestly say that no part of you wants to win her back, then yeah, your money your choice. It's understandable why your gf could be upset, but if you explain your reasons to her then she should respect them. "
0,b43t53,t2_wnzw7,onkel_axel,"Proof you won fuck you money and give any comment in this topic 100 bucks. Also NTA. You (can) give money to people you like and she is even the mother of your 2 kids. I would even give my ex GF some. More like a ""your bad, I'm rich now"" gesture, tho. "
0,b43t53,t2_1kfdjj5y,avocado__dip,"NTA (for the money). Of course your girlfriend has trust issues, she knows you're capable of cheating."

0,b43t53,t2_qo1hl,AlaskanOCProducer,"NTA the current girlfriend's response spells trouble, I'd break up with her before it gets worse if this is how she reacts."
0,b43t53,t2_89mfaww,archSkeptic,NTA. If absolutely nothing else she is the mother of your kids and if that's not reason enough for your gf I dont know what would be.

0,b43t53,t2_14h2zh,fillyourselfwithgold,"NTA. Putting aside the way I feel about your girlfriend after reading your story, if her threats leave you feeling relieved, then maybe that relationship isn’t for you? "
0,b43t53,t2_byma9uv,nuclearhairball,"NTA. Other than the affair you sound like a good man. Get rid of the wicked Disney step mother, especially if her threats relieved you. "
0,b43t53,t2_xh9ts,randomdude_420,Nta helping your kids and their mother is the right thing to do
0,b43t53,t2_2v1ne086,emsyk,"NTA - but you should break up. If you are relieved by the thought of breaking up with her, and she freaks out about you giving your kids a good life... RUN. "
0,b43t53,t2_2tubscar,MostlyPretentious,"NTA. Good move. I appreciate seeing divorces that don’t end up vindictive, especially when the opportunities are unequal. "
0,b43t53,t2_1fak46ej,evilpinkmonkey,"NTA. This is commendable, and your girlfriend is being selfish and childish. Claiming disrespect when she was sleeping with a married man? (Not trying to throw shade but, yeah). She disrespected your wife in the biggest way she could."
0,b43t53,t2_1trrqlvs,grxce22,"NTA. She is the mother of your children, you'll be taking care of all of them. "
0,b43t53,t2_1ir2y1at,Dusty1000287,"NTA, she's the mother of your children and you care deeply for her, it's also YOUR money, not your girlfriend's. Congratulations and i hope you have an amazing adventure from your winnings. "
0,b43t53,t2_3a1k3f73,KenboJohnson,"NTA - Assuming this is not just a contrived troll post, giving her that money is a noble and generous thing to do. Assuming this is real, which I doubt very much :)"
0,b43t53,t2_rybge,MsDutchie,NTA. You do good sharing money with the mktger of your childeren But you should read some post about winning the lottery here on Reddit.
0,b43t53,t2_35832jcz,Jasper_J_Jones,"NTA &#x200B; and I think you should think about offering your gf a little, when you split with her. At least then, everyone is okay, and you can move on."
0,b43t53,t2_6oza95c,Trekz707,"Nta, providing some extra funds to provide a better life for your kids and their mom is admirable ."
0,b43t53,t2_peicf,Paige_Pants,NTA. I'd just frame it this way. Mother of your kids. Her money is their money especially since she's the primary care taker.
0,b43t53,t2_1y3z887u,Rainbowsandkitties,NTA But it REALLY sounds like you're still in love with your ex-wife. You might need to re-evaluate things with the girlfriend...
0,b43t53,t2_1etaa0tk,jgo724,"NTA. I put my kids needs before anyone else's and anyone trying to argue that can fuck right off. You're an awesome dad, OP. "
0,b43t53,t2_3736uaoy,imp_unicornis,"NTA Clear as day. Every decent and normal thinking person would certainly agree. And to be honest, reading such an honest story and quite emotional post, it touched my heart. Cheers lad! Wish you and your fam all the best!"
0,b43t53,t2_233tip4y,Missie-my-dear,"NTA. 1) You're thinking of your kids and their well-being first. That alone makes you NTA. 2) Girlfriend /=/ automatically entitled to your cash. Her behavior is bad, to say the least. Good luck and best wishes, binkies123"
0,b43t53,t2_kmbhw,jatjqtjat,Nta. Read about investing. Invest in indexes funds and never ever spend more then 4% of your money per year. You and your kids can be ser for life. It you could fuck it up like many lotto winners and blow your brains out in a year. BE CAREFUL!
0,b43t53,t2_18u67647,Badstriking,NTA. Undeniably. Her jealousy is sad in a way buy it doesnt make you an asshole.
0,b43t53,t2_sjj6c,mpark6288,"NTA. Not even a little bit. It’s a very mature and generous thing to do, and you are definitely NTA. "
0,b43t53,t2_7h218p2,N1NJ4W4RR10R_,"NTA for sure. Although based on that end, sounds like this may actually be a case of ""you shouldn't be with your GF"". If that's how she reacted I wouldn't trust her with your large sums of money"
0,b43t53,t2_10hpih,_interstitial,NTA. I wonder if I understand logic correctly in asserting that many of the comments attempting to castigate OP seem to have a dash of contrapositive.
0,b43t53,t2_1e5y2a4,GoKickRox,"NTA. You are good ex husband. Not good husband, but good ex husband."
0,b43t53,t2_32anv,jokemon,"YTA &#x200B; reddit is funny when they like to imagine themselves with a ton of money and being ""the man"" &#x200B; you are not with your wife anymore, your new allegiance is your GF, if you are serious about her. &#x200B; You GF should be mad you are choosing your ex wife over your GF."

0,aqy4bn,t2_15ori4,lil_bit_o_sunshine,NTA. You should be able to be alone with your doctor. I would speak to your mother about this. Thats not okay. 
0,aqy4bn,t2_1yllr829,zombiequeen89,Nta but wouldn't an adult have to stay since you're a minor? I know here (UK) I had to have my mum at doctors appointments until I was 16/17. 
0,b9dxwa,t2_tqnjz,vinoestveritas,"NTA. Comment was a bit passive-aggressive, sure, but it honestly doesn't compare to Annie abusing her own damn child. Also, what kind of program accepts an already fairly skinny girl to lose weight???? "
0,b9dxwa,t2_2swdl30q,destroyergsp123,"NTA. Annie is a piece of shit. She is physically, emotionally, and financially abusing her daughter. Absolute scum."

0,akifn8,t2_g7knv1f,jolie178923-15423435,"NTA it's ok to want loyalty from your friends. Keep your distance from both of them, would be my advice."
0,ag9jwg,t2_ktcxk,Nina1701,YTA. Try using this as a teaching/learning moment instead of being reactionary with harsh punishment. It will work much better. Your child is clearly looking for love and validation. I would guess she is not receiving those from either of her parents.
