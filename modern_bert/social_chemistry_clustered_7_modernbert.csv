7,alro7y,t2_r1mj3,MarsNirgal,YTA. Why didn't you ask? It's unbelievable how many of the things in this sub could be resolved by just talking.
7,alro7y,t2_b2m2c,neonsaber,"YTA, you didn't ask her to delete them or to stop teasing about it, and them went through her phone"
7,9w539i,t2_17gma2,BelligerentBenny,Is the driver retarded? I thought this was gonna be about him having an earbud in What the fuck? NTA because no ear bud. And in my state you wouldn't be able to drive with an earbud in. 
7,b3hq29,t2_3fnw5p6d,Zzs920,"NTA. If he is a legit friend, you should get to hang out with him. Your fiance is being overly controlling."
7,acq804,t2_p158aaz,GettingTherapy,"YTA - you try to make your mistakes sound innocent, but they could be avoided. Why in the hell would you tell your GF’s parents she smokes weed? FFS, man. I don’t know how old you are, but it’s time to grow up. "
7,b3hvgo,t2_kv520,Curiousdragon,"NTA-I think everyone should realize that when you drop 25k, you can get an extra 2 hours on the house for parking. You just educated the kid. "
7,b2yfsl,t2_3e83xijq,creepyrisotto,"NTA they need to make sure their dogs don't go on your property, they wouldn't like it if you went on their property without permission. "
7,b2yfsl,t2_10tlwv,SheaRVA,"NTA You told them twice (timidly or not) that their dogs were a problem and they did nothing to change it. You did exactly what you should have done by getting the HOA involved, that's what they're for."
7,aiv7nb,t2_1x2q50ve,JuicyPluot,NTA. the “valid reason” was that you weren’t feeling well & didn’t feel comfortable going into detail. She doesn’t have a right to know intimate medical details about you if you don’t want to share them. 
7,a4e58y,t2_hf0pkyb,_Scallywag,"ESH. You did go through her phone which was shitty but then you found evidence of wrongdoing. In a court of law, that evidence would be illegally obtained and thrown out..but in this situation we can't ignore reality. You have a cheater on your hands so I can't say YTA for leaving. "
7,a9wlbm,t2_13jrqx,PeachyPesco,"NTA, you don't have to be anyone's friend you didn't want to and you didn't really blow up at anyone about it."
7,avxz68,t2_6rj74,enna12,"NTA He's a piece of shit, but he's the one you're friends with, not her. So if you don't feel like telling her, you don't have to."
7,b6cxc3,t2_15wlwi,snxdy,"NTA. It's not like you stole someone's car to do it. Adults are allowed to travel wherever they want with whoever they want, even if that person is just themselves."
7,admbml,t2_1xmuoznt,junkfoodmama,YTA I'm seconding the depression suggestion. You need to go to therapy and if you do get divorce DO NOT PRESUE THE SISTER!! There are plenty of other driven women out there that you dont have to blow up a whole family over your selfish needs. 
7,admbml,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,"YTA. Sounds like you already know that. And you already know how this is going to pan out. She’s not going to betray her sister for you, so saying anything about it will only make your life go down in flames. Don’t. OTOH, your wife sounds depressed."
7,admbml,t2_97p55,ckjb,"NTA for feeling it, but you would be the asshole if you acted on it. Even the slightest hint to the sister is acting on it. If you want to save your relationship, get couples counselling. If you don’t, get a divorce. Either way, never say a word about your feelings for the sister to *anyone*."
7,admbml,t2_5u6of4d,Camiljr,"NTA for now since you haven't really done anything wrong, but you have 2 options here, either leave your wife and stay away from the sister, or talk to your wife and help her get her shit together because she is clearly disturbed. Nothing good will come out of this no matter what way it goes if you decide to pursue the sister."
7,as96jr,t2_31ofpgvg,ActivityBook,"NTA > I've calmly asked him to stop countless times but he doesn't listen. However, I don't think telling him to fuck off is right."
7,azzate,t2_3cw11gjj,BazTheBaptist,NTA. if you can't take it don't dish it out
7,azzate,t2_2b310434,ClutchyourownPearls,"NTA -- She shouldn't have said those things if she can't take it. IMO, what she said was worse. But such is life. No need to apologize. She said something bitchy, you said something similar back. But it sounds like typical mean girl stuff."
7,ay3qov,t2_1yjiygm3,Caktis,"NTA. Don’t sweat it. She’s just being immature. I enjoy the confidence you let shine when you talk about your art. Never lose that. You’re not the asshole, nor a bully. "
7,9vrn0i,t2_13imw9,Brandelyn1135,"YTA. She is your girlfriend, not your property. What makes you think she has to ask your permission to do anything? She can cut her hair, get a tattoo, wear what she likes to wear...and if you don’t like it, feel free to break up with her. What you are doing is trying to exert control. Not a good look. "
7,9vrn0i,t2_q3e7a,Acoustag,"YTA. You're not her parent, so don't treat her like a child. I'm sure she knows exactly how permanent and important a tattoo decision is, and it's her choice to make. You said she doesn't need your permission, but you called her and asked her not to get one. Why?"
7,9vrn0i,t2_7lkvc1g,a-little-sleepy,"YTA. You knew, she sent you a message but then you had to go and call her and convince her not to. Not for her sake but for some wanted sense of yours. She wanted one she told you that, she was about to get one and she told you that. You said no. Uhh.... What? That is exactly what you said you wouldn't do. Your own actions proved your real intentions. "
7,9vrn0i,t2_7lkvc1g,a-little-sleepy,"I'm confused the title says "",AITA for telling my girlfriend she can't get a tattoo?"" But you go on to say "" I don't want to control her, she can do what she wants with her body, I just want to know...."" YTA you said it yourself and then have tried back tracking so you don't seem like the asshole. You told your girlfriend she can't get a tattoo. You were controlling, you don't think what she wants to do with her body is as important as yours, you want to know so you can stop it. "
7,9vrn0i,t2_10xyw5w,RareRino,She's not your property. She has bodily autonomy and can do whatever the fuck she wants without your consent. YTA
7,ava5fh,t2_2v5seqj4,kar4256,NTA. she is a douche for asking you to raise her kids then in the same breath tell you you're unfit to parent her kids. Tell her to draft something and pick an option B if you don't agree to it. 
7,ava5fh,t2_bqcp521,ULTIMABlackstar,"NTA, tell her to get bent and either hand over the money or fuck off, dont light yourself on fire to keep others warm"
7,ava5fh,t2_21frwxhb,IamTheDarkAgent,Sounds like the kids' father will have to step-up and take care of his kids. If you take them then he'll still have rights unless his parental rights have been terminated.
7,ava5fh,t2_873ze,DeliberateConfusion,"NTA. You've told your sister on what terms you will take in her kids. If she doesn't like it, she can find someone else to raise them."
7,ava5fh,t2_14dfxj,should_be_writing1,"YTA. Your sister is *dying.* She’s freaked out and just wants to know that her children are going to be raised as she would raise them, which she can’t, because she is *dying.* are you seriously gonna consider letting these kids go into the foster system just because you can’t handle them going to mass or Sunday school? "
7,ava5fh,t2_qhki5,SB-1,"YTA. She's dying, just tell her what she wants to hear and then do whatever you planned to do when she's gone."
7,b6i6nc,t2_2bswm839,Skullbearer55,YTA and who the fuck cares what she calls herself? Is there so little joy in your life that this is something you're stressed over?
7,b6i6nc,t2_3b7l9acc,bored_german,YTA. Why does it make you so uncomfortable that she uses the word trans? I think you have some unchecked transphobia you need to work through.
7,b41w0n,t2_17rrw5pk,shyinwonderland,"YTA, she was married to him, therefor his family became her family as well. Just because he died it doesn’t change that. "
7,b41w0n,t2_z57ya,The_baby_bat,YTA. Wtf is wrong with you??? She probably doesn't want to interact with your family because it churns out dickheads like you 
7,arg441,t2_zvu9plo,straight_to_10_jfc,NTA Your bf doesnt know how good he has it. Dumbass is gonna ruin a good thing. In fact... You should make him start wearing condoms to preveny any of his concerns from coming true.
7,azbqau,t2_clhlhec,WeirdImprovement,"NTA, you’re not obliged to cook for anyone else outside your family. It’s very nice of you to cook for your sons friend, but you don’t need to cook for his family. You’re not a chef or maid. You said it politely, too"
7,azbqau,t2_2t68g26,PurplePickel,"NTA, sounds like they were intentionally trying to be parasitic and guilt trip you into feeding them. People like that are the worst."
7,azbqau,t2_xkm5s,YOB1997,"NTA, they were fishing for food trying to make you seem like the asshole if you refused. You're not. They didn't even ask, they just invited themselves in. You're allowed to refuse. No is a complete sentence."
7,azbqau,t2_361tvl34,BebenNicole,YTA. The family didn’t even explicitly ask for food? And now you’re punishing your sons friend for something that didn’t even happen. Your whole post smells of elitism and disdain for people poorer than you TBH. 
7,azbqau,t2_2kfc0ni5,LIyre,NTA Oh man I thought you were going to say that you weren't feeding your kids. Thank god that's not the case.
7,azbqau,t2_12ds7s,ThriftyLizzie27,YTA- For the way you responded. That was not nice at all. EDIT: Ok and now that I reread. You seriously told him his friend can't come over anymore? Seriously? Wow so you punish your son and his friend because you don't want his family coming around. Yeah you are the asshole. 
7,azbqau,t2_1g18u5ms,Fire_Eternity,"NTA. Jesus that was super shitty of the parents, and incredibly rude. Feed your own kids, don't just show up on a strangers doorstep and expect to be fed. "
7,azbqau,t2_31vhn01b,dmbeeez,"YTA, you don't have to feed the family, but jeez, one hungry kid? If the parents show up again, I would just usher Chris right out. ""Great to see you all, bye now"". If I've got enough to feed my family healthy meals and they're not hungry, and I'm begruding a child? Yikes. "
7,azbqau,t2_59lcd,Korrin,"YTA, but it's because you're punishing your son over making yourself feel awkward. There's nothing in your description that indicates the other family did anything wrong. It's all assumptions on your part."
7,b67ghb,t2_3761otek,jennymccarthykillsba,YTA. Why would it be ok to skip the party if it’s for your wife. Why would you think she should be ok with that. 
7,ba1fni,t2_1sjey51m,NomadicMaeve,NTA. You didn't abandon your great-grandma or anything. It's fair that you want to go home when you wern't expecting a night over.
7,arelg7,t2_8nv6j,CrnlButtcheeks,"NTA. You’re just doing what you think will be healthiest for the child. If she really doesn’t want to eat, try bargaining with her and see if you can at least get her to eat a little bit. "
7,ba3zvb,t2_2urgfdhw,Erroerroerro,YTA. She's 5' tall and weighs 63kg ffs. Her bmi is not in danger at all. Mate you're always supposed to support your wife. You let your friends fat shame your wife in your own home and then doubled down and said you thought she was fat. Fuck you're a massive asshole. 
7,ba3zvb,t2_bypah,ClothDiaperAddicts,YTA. You don’t agree with your buddies when they call your wife fat as an insult. You shut that down because she’s your wife and they are disrespecting her by laughing over her size/weight/shape. Your friends are also assholes. 
7,ba3zvb,t2_1628qf01,OrangeSockMonkey,"YTA. You and your friends made fun of her, called her fat, and when she confronted you about it, your response was that she isn't thin."
7,ba3zvb,t2_tcwbi7,brandyto,YTA. You made fun of your with with your friends in her home. How do you have to ask random internet strangers if you are The Asshole in this situation?
7,ba3zvb,t2_1el9lspw,susiebubbles,"YTA for allowing your friends to say something like that about your wife, piling in on it then doubling down on it when your wife was upset by it. She might seem like she's over it but I'd wager she isn't and she won't forget it either. Your friends should apologise as well."
7,ba3zvb,t2_3dyrylw0,GinTrouble,"YTA One, your wife isn’t fat. Two, you let your asshole friends make asshole comments about your wife and just agreed with them? You are definitely the asshole. "
7,ba3zvb,t2_dyvnz,OnTheSlope,"lol, I'm probably going to be the only NTA here, but what should you be expected to do? Lie? You didn't mean for her to hear it. Maybe you needed to treat the situation as if she was in the room already? fuck if i know."
7,b7gf0q,t2_ohv69,Dr_thri11,"NTA, but only because you don't get to control who your friend dates. There is absolutely no healthy reason that a 31 year old would date a 17 year old. A 31 year old dating a 17 year old is a fucking creep regardless of how well he treats her."
7,b7gf0q,t2_2mujmsi8,laralye,NTA there is a reason why he's preying on a 17 year old and your friend shouldn't stick around to find out. 
7,b6kwb4,t2_3ar6a8qv,buttgrabbin,NTAshe just hates her job You should let her insult you again in korean and then ask her if she wants you to get her manager but say it in korean
7,b6kwb4,t2_2wmq2tyd,annoyed68,NTA Honestly just say it to her face. It’ll spook her ass real good to know you’ve been listening in on her “private” venting this whole time. 
7,b6kwb4,t2_11lli6fn,HotConfusion,"NTA and it sounds like that cashier deserves to lose her job. She's been pulling this shit in a customer service job for how long? I cashiered as a teen and know it can be taxing, but she could have simply said nothing."
7,b6kwb4,t2_12avm2h4,jer1230,"NTA - but oooooo If i were you, i would’ve very much enjoyed responding to her in Korean and that would’ve checked her ass "
7,b6kwb4,t2_14185y,SailorMarch,"NTA but next time you need to defend yourself, seriously. You wouldn’t be thought of as a bitch if you responded to what she had said. "
7,b6kwb4,t2_2gamrv7k,bbbriz,"NTA. And I would even say she's been racist towards you. Even if you are not Japanese, she thought you were and told you to go back to Japan. That's racist af. She should answer for what she did. And I'd do it by asking to see the manager in Korean right in front of her the next time she does so. "
7,b6kwb4,t2_3a2j0phm,InsightFrisbee,NTA - that’s super rude. But as you’re not looking to get her fired you should confront her in Korean - that shock and embarrassment will surely make her rethink her behavior :)
7,b6kwb4,t2_2bwdmrkt,vipul172,NTA. She is being a asshole for being rude. What if somebody knows korean and hears her? Their first step would be to report her.
7,b6kwb4,t2_7861nye,poptart_divination,"I'm gonna say YTA. You knew what she was saying. You made eye contact. She stopped talking shit and avoided your gaze. It sounds like she got the hint that you understood her. If she does it again, tell her boss. But I know if I were her, I'd watch what I say around people after that. "
7,avujoj,t2_1luir6ps,alliecomma,"NTA. Even if her story is true, this isn't the first time it's happened. Sounds like she's trying to make you feel bad for her ""bad day"" so that she doesn't have to take responsibility. She sounds like a bad friend. "
7,avujoj,t2_xv636,ex-inteller,NTA. She's non-communicative. She can't expect you to read her mind the one time she has a real reason for being an asshole.
7,avujoj,t2_z0h6d,misswrenbird,"NTA. You had every right to be annoyed that she didn’t show again, and had no way of knowing something was going on because she didn’t tell you. "
7,b01xst,t2_2uyazqs,PcsArePeopleToo,NTA. Don't let her reaction ruin this great experience for you. You thought of her during it and tried to bring her into the conversation and that should be enough.
7,b01xst,t2_1cgbri2t,Yenny1104,"NTA wtf it’s not like she was the bride in a wedding, what overshadowing can one do at a fucking bar meet up. "
7,b01xst,t2_2fhpp6z1,thebirbs,"NTA. She wants you to be social, she should get used to sharing the spotlight. She should be happy her friends are getting to know you. "
7,b01xst,t2_1ujofibo,JillParrish77,NTA but she is! Good grief how rude that you finally come out of your shell & she chastises you like a child for it. 
7,b01xst,t2_2iun29gy,Donnyboi69,"NTA, your girl should be more happy at the fact that you were social instead of getting mad that you ""overshadowed"" her. "
7,b01xst,t2_l5i0773,Suicideinsilence22,"NTA What is wrong with her?! You have social anxiety and she knows about it, then when you try to have a conversation with someone she is mad at you? she is defienetly the asshole here."
7,b01xst,t2_1xtd9gx2,Cent1234,"NTA Sounds to me like she's trying to 'fix' you, and you've just demonstrated that you don't need 'fixing.'"
7,ay6cj0,t2_3cjdzjnm,covertassembly,NTA Very suspicious. Sounds like he is hiding it tbh. Like if he says drop it. Id ask why wont u post a pic of us Maybe post a pic of u 2 and tag him in it. He gets mad....CHEATINNN. Jk but seriously its fishy
7,ay6cj0,t2_mkqyw,sparklaw,NTA. And you should get a new boyfriend. I bet your next boyfriend doesn’t have to asked to put you and him photos on Instagram. 
7,a95aw2,t2_1xri6p3r,lunar_lena,"NTA. He agreed to go. So now he has to go. Whether it's church or not is irrelevant, he made a commitment to do something, so now he has to do it. End of story."
7,aq066o,t2_1jwmj4,Social_Ascetic,YTA - It's a San Pedro cactus. You can buy those legally. See them all the time at home garden stores. You blew this out of proportion off of one person's response on Reddit. 
7,artjjm,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,"NTA. By working on meth, he's putting safety at risk. If he fucks up, someone could die. By having it in the vehicle, he's putting you at risk. He's suggested you steal things. Report him for sure."
7,b94tbi,t2_34moz5tm,LikeTheColor93,"NTA, just be polite and don’t do it in front of others"
7,b0kall,t2_1mmrlkec,smakchat,NTA. He's annoying and basically casting you in the role of a nag because he feels like eating with his hands and throwing things on the floor... 
7,b0kall,t2_21mo3yfx,wwwooowwwzzzaaa,NTA You're not acting like a mom. He is acting like a child. You are calling him out on acting like a child. Man-babies are far more annoying than real babies.
7,b0kall,t2_1ygiy2zl,misiepatysie,Going against the majority here but... YTA. You can expect him to clean after himslef but why on earth do you mind if he is eating with cuttlery or with his hands? -
7,b5lqc1,t2_1wgoxii5,DisneyBride28, NTA it's not your job to police your friend's actions. And you shouldn't have to drop one of your closest friends over a mistake he made. People fuck up. We don't just ditch them. 
7,b5lqc1,t2_2jn393l0,PossibleCook,NTA. Jon is the real a-hole here and your wife kind of sucks for trying to put you in a situation that you’re not a part of. 
7,b5lqc1,t2_2tgifvb1,badlilbishh,NTA- Jon is the asshole for putting you in this position and cheaters suck. But he’s still your friend and if you don’t want to drop him that’s your choice. Obviously your not condoning his cheating because you called him an idiot for it but he’s still your friend. 
7,acrtv1,t2_751y9,lkantra,NTA of course. But this break is a breakup. He’s keeping you on the back burner just in case. Don’t let him do that. Cut it off. 
7,azyhvk,t2_2v1p36y2,unpopular-aye-aye,"NTA You were trying to stand up for yourself and did so politely. No one has the right to screen in your face. Your mother should have stood up for you there. If it were me, I would expect an apology though I doubt you'll get one."
7,abyygl,t2_2d2o8f5r,AmITasshole_opinion,Wow YTA. You can sleep with whoever you want but to do that is just petty and is only going to fuel her paranoia. Gross all around. 
7,abyygl,t2_x88w1,RoseDreams,"Nta... unless you think you might get back with your ex, then yta. Otherwise, you are single and free to do what you want. "
7,abyygl,t2_ljd67,PhantomGeass,"NTA she is your ex, and she can go fuck herself. You have no obligation to care about her feelings anymore. "
7,af02nn,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,YTA. You only want him back because he's with someone else. Six months won't change his potential for a relationship with your parents.
7,af02nn,t2_zali1n,SantaPachaMama,YTA . A manipulative horrible person. You need to gtfo and away from him. Don't fuck with his new life. Go grow up and mature. Don't end up in r/nicegirls. 
7,af02nn,t2_r1mj3,MarsNirgal,"YTA. Don't put this on him. If letting him go was a mistake, own it and live with it, don't try to ruin his life a second time out of selfishness."
7,af02nn,t2_13imw9,Brandelyn1135,"YTA. If you have any humanity in your heart, you will leave him alone. Holy shit. PS I don’t know what kind of person, when hearing that a former boyfriend attempted suicide because of their break up thinks “I don’t know how serious his attempt was”. That is cold blooded. Edit: Typo"
7,ay3hi1,t2_1xytpzcl,Sphel_,"NTA, guy needs to learn to take a hint, be careful it wasn't some sort of scam tho, he could have been a distraction whilst a second guy stole something from you "
7,ay3hi1,t2_awff2,CatherineConstance,"NTA. Wtf dude you should NOT feel bad about this. You didn't owe him anything, not even a response to his first question. It's nice of you to want to help but you couldn't, and he should have stopped WAY before he did. Maybe he is down on his luck, maybe not, but either way it is NOT your problem."
7,arskny,t2_oz5b8,thepuppylife,NTA. This isn't going to change. Get a boyfriend who doesn't have mommy issues. This will be a battle you'll forever fight AND LOSE. It's not your job to make your S.O see the light. 
7,arskny,t2_2z4cj0jm,IgotCarasma,"NTA It sounds like you're dating Howard from Big Bang Theory. As long as you two live in the same town as she's in, you'll always be the ""other woman"". Yeesh! Good luck."
7,9xssts,t2_6r80u,Joyrock,"Not only NTA, but good on you for taking the fight to her and making it extremely clear what she did wrong. "
7,9xssts,t2_175929,redditKMC,"NTA at all - if someone I knew did this, I would also chew them out and never talk to them again. Kick her to the curb and never look back."
7,b8ukxy,t2_1sq23q8l,highesthouse,"NTA Bigotry is never okay; I don’t care who you are. I respect others’ free speech, but that doesn’t mean that bigotry doesn’t deserve to be shamed by the whole of society. You’re never going to be an asshole for telling a bigot to stop spewing bigotry around you."
7,b8ukxy,t2_12ezy51w,laik72,"NTA, it may be the only way to retain a relationship with him. But I hope maybe you can find a way to turn him around instead of leaving him isolated in front of the talking heads."
7,9v2shd,t2_994jo,thiscouldbemassive,"Absolutely NTA. Your mom is being a brat because she wants some social attention and you denied it to her. But it's not her baby, and it's not her body. Frankly putting your foot down and asserting your boundaries is a good thing, before she starts getting too entitled. She'll get over it."
7,9v2shd,t2_2jx08z57,ElisabethHornswoggle,NTA. But maybe you can compromise and do something with her to make her happy. Perhaps frame a copy of the ultrasounds and give them as a gift to your mum :) 
7,9v2shd,t2_uut6mxm,Kraw24,"I mean YNTA, I completely feel you.. but I guess it’s your mom. I’d bite the bullet and just let her be excited, it’s definitely better than her being depressed, right?"
7,aqf7kc,t2_1cfog012,earthymama826,"NTA - I'm biased here. That's one of my biggest pet peeves. I'm forever chasing my child around with a tissue screaming about ""STOP SUCKING SNOT UP INTO YOUR BRAIN"" which is neither anatomically correct nor a level headed, calm response. Oh well. No one is perfect. 😂"
7,asy9pq,t2_2o1jkelk,falketyfalke,NTA. She's gaming the system. Good on you for calling her on it and for taking care of your true friends when you can. 
7,aj3app,t2_1pclp81m,bagelwithclocks,"NTA, Go for it, you don't have to have a relationship with someone if you don't want to for any reason. If you think they are toxic, go with your gut. Just because they are your sibling doesn't mean you have to have a relationship with them."
7,aej8eu,t2_u82k6,queenofthera,"YTA There's nothing unreasonable about talking to your friend on the phone for that long, (and your partner is being a bit of an asshole for making you feel weird about it), BUT you should be making time to say goodnight to your son every night. "
7,9x5xkv,t2_j6cwi,vermonsterskibum,NTA given the fact that your brother is an asshole and the fact that he did that to your mom made me laugh so fucking hard
7,9x5xkv,t2_g7qyrmf,Obscurian,"NTA. He's old enough to be considerate of you, or at least old enough to LOOK AROUND THE PARKING LOT FOR YOU! Let him walk home if he's so impatient. Like what, he can't even wait ten minutes? What a brat!"
7,ao0dam,t2_j3usfmy,toshido22,"No NTA at all. Sorry but your husband and his daughter are crazy. Your stepdaughter is a garbage human. He wants to divorce you because you don't want to watch your adult, nurse, stepdaughter kill her dad/your husband. Especially after all the stuff you did to take care of him right after his heart attack. Wow married into the Crazies eh?"
7,arytq5,t2_lgncd0m,booksgnome,YTA. He was clearly already handling the situation. He wasn't hiding your existence or using her to inflate his own ego. He probably didn't tell you because he knew you would push the boundary. 
7,arytq5,t2_qnotl4,saymynamebastien,"YTA. Even though you guys have agreed to look through each other's phones, that doesn't mean you get to block whoever you want. I understand being worried about the texts from another girl, but it's not your decision to make. "
7,arytq5,t2_bnwhlq5,jenvrooyen,"YTA - he was already telling her that he wasn’t interested, and wasn’t leading her on in any way. If you had an issue with him being in contact with her, you should have talked to him before taking the steps that you did."
7,arytq5,t2_qho5ono,LittleBookOfRage,YTA it's up to him who he wants to remove from his life not you. He was upfront about his situation with her and you did not need to message her at all. I would be furious if my partner did this to me.
7,arytq5,t2_25y53b53,InTheBinIGo,YTA. He was handling it and probably could have blocked her himself if he wanted to. Also you guys sounds very young... dang
7,axyz94,t2_304sd7im,owlcityy,NTA but grow a pair and block him. You’re not obligated to talk or meet up with a person you’ve never met. 
7,acci3e,t2_lyzk3,PianoJkprd001,"NTA, but you gave him a choice and he simply chose the one you didn't want. If you didn't think you could handle the breakup, you shouldn't of given him an ultimatum."
7,9ypl3q,t2_6yuaf,Viperbunny,NTA. Your child is having issues. Having electronics is a privilege. He showed he is not deserving of the privilege. I highly recommend getting your son into therapy. It sounds like he is going through a lot. 
7,9ypl3q,t2_8uvxq,aslokaa,NTA and I am just wondering if you can still do an extremely late abortion on him.
7,9zec50,t2_1xan3y53,ddevarah,NTA. She could've asked you nicely and you still wouldn't have been obligated to go out of your way to help her out.
7,9zec50,t2_9eti3,KatFrog,NTA You are not required to give her a ride because she asked. She's being an asshole by trying to make you feel guilty.
7,auj823,t2_ibmc0,HereticalMessiah,YTA - I get why you hid it. But you took an extremely insecure individuals source of comfort because you don’t like the way it looks on her. That’s an asshole move. 
7,auj823,t2_2sw4bedd,actualdisasterbi,YTA You stole her hoodie and are refusing to give it back just because you don't like the way it looks. How could you be anything but an asshole?
7,auj823,t2_2dhwv9h,sqitten,"YTA You stole her things. If you can't accept her for who she is, break up with her. But don't steal something you know means a lot to her. I mean, don't steal anything at all, but it's especially bad when you know how much it means to her."
7,auj823,t2_1sq23q8l,highesthouse,"YTA She’s right when she tells you that she decides what she wears. If you don’t like it, she’s under no obligation to change it. That doesn’t give you the right to steal her property, especially if it’s a source of security for her."
7,auj823,t2_1992ynkl,ETanny,YTA 100% You cant hide your girlfriends clothes just because you dont like it. That is very VERY controlling. How would you feel if you found out your girlfriend hid your favourite things because she didn't like it. 
7,auj823,t2_187xb4p3,soulangelic,YTA. It’s pretty low to steal something from someone you claim to love just because you don’t like the way it looks on her.
7,auj823,t2_34uie20s,FoxesInSweaters,YTA And she probably needs therapy. This reminds me of the peanuts kid who needs the blanket. There are better ways of going about this.
7,auj823,t2_y14h6,oohrosie,"YTA. 1000%, you took someone's comfort object away from them because you made it about you and your opinions. Give it back to her and you probably need to find a new girlfriend, considering you can't handle her not fitting your mold."
7,auj823,t2_35b6ghn3,trekmystars,YTA. She would not let you control what she wears so you stole from her???? Like wtf if I was dating you this would be a major red flag. 
7,auj823,t2_1b1torqv,Spider4Hire,"YTA - Jesus Christ, is this the first opportunity you have had in your life that you thought you could actually control? I can't wait for her to find out that you had it all along so that she can move on without you."
7,am5vvx,t2_32o4hedc,ytayta,NTA Man I hate going to first birthday parties. There's no chance they'll remember it. Get a good picture of the kid covered in cake in a high chair and that's all they'll want to see in the future anyway.
7,am5vvx,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,"NTA. She's turning one and won't even remember this party. If your family wants to have a big party, they're more than welcome to foot the bill for it."

7,b5als3,t2_mqtgk,mayfleur,"YTA. Don't even joke about that stuff. This isn't a matter of being ""over sensitive"". Whether you think it's a big deal or not, even joking about shooting up your school is a dick move and of fucking course your school reacted the way they did. Considering how many school shootings occur every year, all threats need to be taken 100% seriously. "

7,a0ik2l,t2_tdmua6d,Hans_Micheal,NTA. Not nice to call her fat and all that but if what you said about her bullying an autistic kid than she had it coming.
7,algye5,t2_zbqdu,eb_straitvibin,"NTA but make her a card or something man, your mom doesn’t care if you spend lots of money, she wants to know you care "
7,algye5,t2_hdk2j,regularforcesmedic,"NTA. I think this kinda borders on a SHP, but okay. Your Christmas and birthday money is a gift to you to spend on yourself. It's weird and selfish for her to ask you to spend it on her birthday."
7,axgfkm,t2_27fzqdrd,LeadSheep,"NTA. That dude should understand that your brother has other necessities. And like you said, he could get up earlier so that way he won't be late. I would say NTA, he deserved it."

7,ajth1w,t2_21hjk8jb,jelliebaby51,YTA - it was not your place to tell him that. If she wanted him to know she’d have told him. What a breach of her trust. 
7,ajth1w,t2_1czr04,Orange_Paisley,"YTA. It really wasn't your business or your place. For the record I agree that she should tell him and tell him her plans, but ultimately it's not really his decision since it is her body."
7,ajth1w,t2_gitkg,pm_me_your_molars,"YTA. If someone doesn't want to tell their partner that they're getting an abortion, that's their choice. Men can do really stupid and awful things when they disagree with their partner's decision to abort."
7,b1wti7,t2_14tuie,Noobzorg,"NTA. People saying you would be the asshole probably do shit like this themselves. These are your friends, if you have any respect for the guy you should tell him. Bring on the hate."
7,aml0zy,t2_ibmc0,HereticalMessiah,NTA - it doesn’t seem like you did anything to upset your friend. It sounds like he had a stick up his ass and you took collateral damage from his teenage angst flaring up. If it all happened this way then absolutely NTA. Talk to your buddy though. Sounds like he may be going through some shit. 
7,av4bff,t2_yukgan7,unlucky_dominator_,"YTA He was there first, the fact that you and all of your friends sat down and still needed space is not his problem. "
7,b267q0,t2_f7v97,Bobalery,"NTA. You will NEVER be an asshole for respecting your wife’s wishes while she is birthing your child. Lesson learned about your uncle though- if you tell him sensitive information that shouldn’t be spread around, you need to make that crystal clear to him."
7,b267q0,t2_g7knv1f,jolie178923-15423435,"NTA you and your wife are on the same page, and you two are the only people that matter here."
7,azvhsx,t2_p1u7v5b,lucifertheecat,"YTA Its common decency to hold the door for the person behind you until they hold it, also you kinda sound like a asshole, people aren't expecting you to be a doorman, its just being nice."
7,azvhsx,t2_ynabolz,PickleweaselNaeNae,NTA. It's nice when someone holds the door for a person but that's more voluntary. You may be an asshole if the other person's hands are full though. That would be bad manners. 
7,atksbr,t2_17fd9n,Omega_Maru,"NTA. Thats animal abuse. She cant treat a dog the same way she treats a rabbit. Suggest maybe getting a different animal that can stay in a cage, like a hamster"
7,b6mjur,t2_glp7xoq,seminarysmooth,"NAH if you don’t have the funds to cover the stay. YTA if you explored air bnb’s and couldn’t get a cheaper rate. If the cost of the hotel and getting yourself cleaned up is the reason you’re not buying a gift then def YTA. FWIW, you have a year to send a gift. "
7,b6mjur,t2_140iiz,beckdawg19,"YTA. It's common courtesy that if you go to the wedding, you get a gift. It's not their fault that you weren't wedding-ready, and you don't have to go if it's going to be that big of a hassle."
7,b6mjur,t2_77jyj,Hudre,"YTA - Yes of course you're the asshole, just give them $50 in a card and you're good. You accepted the invitation, you don't get to then complain about the logistics you either didn't look up or disregarded. I assume you knew the date of your birthday when you accepted as well. "
7,9z7xes,t2_2bedmliu,4LokoButtHash,NTA because feelings don't make you an asshole. Actions do. If you were to tell her you could phrase it a lot better though than how you wanted to say it. 
7,b47upj,t2_pf0c0o2,rebeccavt,"Did you seriously keep a tally of his half of the groceries, etc? So petty. YTA. He’s your husband and you share your finances. It’s all a wash in the end. It sounds like you just want something to hold over him. "

7,aqpujl,t2_c8wjd,joshb44231,"You’re NTA. It’s not fair that you have to worry about stepping in dog shit because your neighbor is a selfish, self-centered asshole who only cares about himself. "
7,aqpujl,t2_1u4adrh7,ScumbagSaiko,"NTA ""he has to talk about this to his neighbour"", really? If you're so stupid to think that your dog can shit in other's lawns and you don't pick it up, you don't deserve to live in a society"

7,aqpujl,t2_vcl37,Pugontoast,"YTA If you have to ask is it ok to handle faeces in order to exact revenge, the answer is YTA. But he’s the WAY bigger ass hole, dog is the real victim here just trying to poop in peace. "
7,apk6ll,t2_qtbd5,Malbethion,YTA. If you don't have the sort of relationship where telling the boss to fuck off is okay then you need to get a grip on your temper.

7,apk6ll,t2_mt3lw,RemoveTheTop,"YTA. Of course you're the asshole, you acknowledge you have anger managment issues, and you took them out on him."
7,apk6ll,t2_5nu5a,Simon_Magnus,"YTA - You were just angry because things weren't going your way in the activity you were taking part in. It doesn't make you a bad person, but you should apologize for it."
7,acm383,t2_3wufj,RowHard,"NTA. People deserve a break but if you don't like how a company is run, ie doesn't have good customer support, then don't use their product. If you reach out and yell at someone, then you will become the asshole since whoever you reach will not have control over how takes vacation. "
7,atvjvo,t2_obujd,oozing_oozeling,">""Fine. I don't care how much trouble I'm in I am NOT eating that. You can't make me."" As an internet stranger, I'm proud AF of your son for standing up for himself in a firm but not unnecessarily rude way. He sounds very mature. NTA of course."
7,atvjvo,t2_1wfbhafu,learningprof24,NTA. I would actually tell your mom she can't see him again until SHE apologises to him for her insensitivity and riaking his health.
7,atvjvo,t2_dfu07r,MusenUse_KC21,"NTA - Your son is well within his right to refuse to eat something that will cause him to break out in hives. Your mother is the asshole for trying to force him to eat something she knows that may not kill him, but will put him in a bad place."
7,atvjvo,t2_62xsz,happythoughts413,"NTA. The “clean your plate” thing is just a power play, which sucks. Your parenting shouldn’t revolve around showing off how much you can force a child to do. Also, he’s ALLERGIC. It doesn’t matter if it doesn’t send him into full anaphylactic shock. No one “owes” someone the right to force them to feel bad."
7,atvjvo,t2_2szhxxgd,amethystjade15,NTA. Agree with everyone else that your mother is. He’s only kind of allergic? That’s still shitty. And your son is only an asshole if he responded with “I’m not gonna eat this and also I hope you die!” while flipping the table. 
7,atvjvo,t2_mxijq,Random_act_of_Random,NTA - How can you possibly think you are the asshole here. Your son is taking care of his own illness and your mom is trying to hurt him. I'm glad your son took a stand and I would reward that behavior.
7,atvjvo,t2_17j735,westcoastexpat,"NTA. What is wrong with her? Have you played it back for her? ""You're mad at my son for refusing to eat something he's allergic to. And you want him to apologize to you. When can both of us expect _your_ apology?"""

7,atvjvo,t2_8rrjj,Xannin,"NTA. I wouldn't force an adult to eat something they're mildly allergic to, so I wouldn't force a child to do it either."
7,atvjvo,t2_i6cwn34,rayraywest0,NTA you’d think as a grandmother she’d want to avoid causing your son pain. Please don’t let her cook for him anymore.

7,atvjvo,t2_ttks5ss,Boba_Kun,NTA - Your son should be able to refuse to consume any food even slightly detrimental to his health. Just because it doesn't kill you doesn't mean you should consume it. 
7,atvjvo,t2_310tfvv9,katmeowness88,"NTA For crying out loud, HE IS ALLERGIC! Your mother is the one that needs to apologize. It sounds like she just has to be ""right"", even if she knows she's wrong. She is the AH here "
7,atvjvo,t2_1ckav7k5,Luminosss,NTA and i must say you seem to have raised your child well. He did everything right. You need to have a serious conversation with your mother tho. This cant Happen again

7,atvjvo,t2_15l2thbw,Ariyanwrynn1989,NTA and your moms a b*tch. An allergic reaction is an allergic reaction. How can you knowingly and willingly want to give a kid something you know hes allergic to just because it wont kill him?

7,atvjvo,t2_xzcum,cobaltcontrast,"NTA Smart kid. Please rub this in her face. When he says he's allergic, she needs to listen to him. She needs to swallow her narcissism I mean pride. Respect and protect that kid. "
7,atvjvo,t2_2fb42lgn,Donna1990,Soooo NTA! Your son is allergic and your mother needs to respect that! OMG what if that time he had a severe reaction??? My son is allergic to nuts and has an EpiPen. Your mother should respect his food restrictions and not put her grandson at risk because of her self righteousness. I’m sorry she did that to him and you. 
7,atvjvo,t2_1yr6yuss,diplomaticDeveloper,"NTA, your mom was about to poison your child. Whether or not it's deadly is irrelevant. She was trying to force discomfort on your boy and that's _never_ okay."

7,atvjvo,t2_ipwqx,Fishface248,NTA. You mom is so far in the wrong here. He is 5. If her ego cannot handle a 5 year old (rightfully) talking back then she obviously has issues she needs to work out. 
7,atvjvo,t2_u6tzr,regularshowman1,"NTA, obviously. Of course your son shouldn’t have to eat food he’s allergic to, and of course he shouldn’t have to apologize for not eating said food."

7,atvjvo,t2_660hh,differentimage,"NTA. Be proud of your kid for standing up to his grandmother who tried to force him to eat something he’s allergic to. That’s the best situation you can hope for, it shows he understands and is able to advocate for himself. Your mom seriously needs to check herself. What kind of abusive power struggle garbage is this?!"
7,atvjvo,t2_ztc9r,kittymctacoyo,NTA at all but your mother is being a huge asshole. You’re doing the right thing teaching your son autonomy and that he has rights etc. This is very important. Your mother should know better all around.

7,atvjvo,t2_ehvk2,ChasingKills,NTA She is hella evil hives are no joke and she expects him just to deal with it.
7,atvjvo,t2_28np7iy7,whats_it_to_you77,"YTA. You should not let your son speak to his grandmother that way. He should apologize for how he refused, not for the act of refusing. You owe her an apology too. She keeps him for you to go to work--I'm sure you don't pay her and then you complain about her. Ungrateful. "
7,b5x6fk,t2_1ix4h2xo,SilverDirt,"NTA 14 and 15 are NOT kids. If they cant be trusted home alone then something is wrong, and if she simply cant leave them home alone she needs to get the fuck over herself. Theyre not children, theyre young adults."

7,b9zrc4,t2_3jrx0q2u,ClapBackRat,"NTA - given the history it is definitely the right thing to do to 100% cut her out. If he cannot do this, he values her more than he does you."
7,b9zrc4,t2_31uqrglr,heheok1,"NTA. YOU deserve better but if you both really want to heal this relationship, then you both need to get rid of toxicity. If that is her, then she has to go far far away. But if your husband doesn't think the same, then you need to rethink your priorities. "

I know you're just looking for validation that your roommate is an asshole for knocking on your door, but I'm guessing a lot more happened that lead up to that.

7,b0kk0a,t2_2dfuv6r6,themostanxiousone,"NTA-they're the assholes. Sounds like they're not good dog owners either, you can't lock a dog in a 12×12 room. If they *actually* returned the puppy I'm sure it'll get a better home, you're doing it and yourself a favor."
7,b0kk0a,t2_x1j6s,TentaclesAndCupcakes,NTA - It was double-rude to make you out to be the asshole when they did the wrong thing in the first place.
7,awcw3c,t2_10xtr7,lenachristina,NTA - you have no obligation to be your brother's caretaker. That is something you do because you *want* to and not because you're forced to. This is your parents' mess to sort out - not yours.
7,amj73s,t2_1xtlje8,honeymustardcustard,NTA but it sounds like your mom got some problems. Missing having young ones around or something. I feel bad for both of you in this situation.
7,amj73s,t2_2e07mipu,desperatehousecat2,NTA. I know it’s not your fault but it’s kind of disturbing that your mom would even be comfortable letting and 8 year old girl sleep in a teenage boys room. You need to have a talk with you mom and put your foot down.

7,b8dw7z,t2_2yx974fw,psychominnie624,"YTA for assuming they have to give you the money. No one is under obligation to loan you anything, even if they’re family, especially when they don’t know you. Take out a personal loan "

7,a29xtv,t2_164d1x40,imsorrybutihad2,NTA. Your roomie obviously knows this - that’s why she came with that fishing questions and then tried to put the hook in your cheek with the “you should totally do that!” Your roomie is kind of a manipulative cunt.
7,a29xtv,t2_d580y,ruinedbykarma,"NTA. Your roommate definitely is, though. Those aren't your kids. You can't even afford your family, let alone hers. Next time she asks, ask her what she's getting for your family."
7,a29xtv,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,NTA. Why the heck would she assume you're buying her kids gifts.. Theyre not your kids. You have no relation or obligation to them.. Maybe let your roommate know that she and her kids don't need to get YOU anything as you won't be getting them anything because you're low on cash.
7,a29xtv,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"NTA. She's the asshole. Expecting you to buy gifts for her 4 kids, especially the teen, especially when you're having money problems is an asshole move. Don't get them anything. So entitled and selfish of her. Remind her you are having money problems. "
7,b8eufp,t2_1hut44ma,poke_thebear,YTA. You are not entitled to your SO's body just because you feel like it. He is just as deserving of respect and time to deal with the things that are causing emotional stress. He doesn't have to give you physical intimacy because you ask for it. 
7,a5j2x6,t2_p2x1qs4,InsanityBrickBoi,"NTA. Just because she has some kind of handicap, that doesn't justify being selfish and asinine like that. You should file a noise complaint. "

If you did this to a sweet old person who didn't know how to google their antiques before selling them, you would definitely be TA. That said, I hope you have a dog. This guy seems like the type to try to get his shit back. What a piece of work."
7,ba5yf8,t2_bypah,ClothDiaperAddicts,"NTA. It’s on the seller to know what they’re selling. I’ve undersold before and it sucks, but it was my own fault. And that guy is a dick, so I feel even less sorry for him. "
7,ba5yf8,t2_gqmih,vaxfarineau,"NTA. You bought the items for what the neighbor asked for it, so they’re yours, fair and square. You don’t have to give anybody anything back, because you own them. "
7,ba5yf8,t2_9omsv,TheSilverNoble,"NTA It was fun and games when he thought he was ripping you off. But he's going to whine when it turns out he wasn't as smart as he thought. The worst kind of person. Maybe if he'd have been nicer, someone would have helped him out. "

7,ba5yf8,t2_31afgbp6,PetiteSelene,"NTA. This is their fault. That's what happens when you treat people badly. It'll bite you in the butt. As for the uncle, he should have asked for those items long before they were sold. "
7,ba5yf8,t2_3at1toux,LuriemIronim,"NTA. It’s his own fault for not doing his research, and he sounds like a dick. It’s not like he’s a kindly old man selling things to pay for his cancer treatment. "

7,apfrva,t2_7a5vc,Tess47,NTA but this behavior will not end. Are you good with this happening for the rest of your life? I am not passing judgement on his behavior or your behavior. The real question is if you are OK having this happen forever. FOREVER. 
7,apfrva,t2_17crx6ok,MoreIsLessIsMore,"I swear I’ve read this before. Is this a repost? Also, NTA. Your bf is being inconsiderate. Set boundaries. If he won’t come in to shower, then you go shower. Lock the door at midnight and make it clear that since he wasn’t in on time, he can sleep on the couch because disturbing your sleep at 3:30am is not acceptable. "
7,apfrva,t2_pflm0rq,Snowflake1952,"YTA. Damn, do you think you could be any more demanding? Should he send his friends home because you say it's bath time? Get your big girl panties on. Go take your own shower for once and go to sleep. You sound like a spoiled entitled immature little girl."
7,aeaa1b,t2_4at5t,Lucavious,YTA for yelling at your grandma. Come on man you have to know by escalating it that far she's only gonna get more stubborn. Just tell her you love her and you want her to take them for your sake so you don't worry.

7,b13q2u,t2_1zyec91o,dotsisu,"NAH. You're trying to keep your friend around, but to be honest, the best thing to do is to cut contact with your ex and her sister. It's unhealthy to be in close contact with an ex's family member."

7,almfgo,t2_2hhlzm4n,RadioSupply,"NTA. Maybe you could have handled it with perfect poise and decorum, but who needs that when you’re doing high intensity? And if he’s not your trainer, your workout isn’t his business whatsoever. It’s totally fine to ask or tell a stranger to stop talking to you if you don’t want to be bothered. "
7,almfgo,t2_14qp9xxv,An-Anthropologist,"NTA. He was being really obnoxious. It's not even like he was trying to make small talk with you, he was critizing you. "
7,almfgo,t2_iqm2veg,Box-o-bees,"NTA, He was either trying to be an asshat, or in his own weird way trying to motivate you. Either way he was out of line. A lot of people don't respond well to the pushy type of motivation he was trying on you. I know I sure don't, if I want help with something I'll fucking ask for it. Otherwise, leave me alone."
7,almfgo,t2_nh98v,IncredibleBulk2,NTA. You might have hurt his fee fees but you don't owe anyone a conversation. He was basically negging you. He was being rude.

7,almfgo,t2_xx4fv,chipface,"NTA. You go to the gym to work out, not to fucking socialize. Also, his remarks about your workout were uncalled for. You wouldn't be an asshole for telling him to fuck off."

7,ba2tgk,t2_13mt9u,chickypee,"YTA for confronting her about it. Next time, just say “No thank you” and keep walking. You don’t have to show them your receipt but they don’t want you to know that. At Sam’s Club, you do have to show your receipt because that’s in the terms you agreed to when joining. "
7,ba2tgk,t2_6wlo1,Bodymaster,"NTA. I have no idea what a Walmart greeter is or if it's their job to randomly harass paying customers. But somebody asking you for a receipt is basically accusing you of theft. What a nice way to treat your customers! Unless they can prove you are a thief (CCTV, etc.) then they have no right to do that to you. I'd have told them to fuck off as well."
7,adr3ge,t2_zjtdy,gen_angry,"NTA: Your BF lives there, sister does not. He was sprayed at his own home and she's not apologetic at all about it. She's a racist bitch and needs the cops called on her for assault."

7,b1p9n7,t2_53y95e,LucidOutwork,NTA It's a job. You don't owe them your life. They want to schedule you for days you can't work. Find a job where they treat you with more respect.

7,ams5jm,t2_32dol4yp,JWilk79,"NTA. If you both discussed and prearranged for him to pick you up at a certain time, he is 100% the asshole by ditching you to watch a game. You definitely have the right to be a little pouty lol. "
7,ams5jm,t2_cybnh,wimaine,"NTA, of course. I can't tell how much in advance he dropped this on you, but the later it was, the bigger asshole he is. Obviously you can get home via other means, but it sounds like it's going to cost some $ and be much more of a pain. The fact that his reaction when you called him out was ""STFU and GFY"" just adds to his charm. /s"
7,b8yzzv,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,NTA. Your wedding IS about you and your fiancée. That's the point. You can have a wedding with immediate family and a few friends if you want. You can have a later reception if you want to separate the events.
7,ays9f4,t2_6myjf,yamoth,"NTA - You do you, if you don't want to sleep at your MIL house then don't. With that said, be an adult about it and confront her instead of pussy foot around it."

7,b64tgf,t2_1n8km6xn,OneSardine,NTA. You're hiring them to do a service for you & paying them. It's well within your rights to fire them. Best to find new cleaners LOL.

7,b06rs9,t2_29a9o3k,Blinni3,YTA. It is highly toxic to expect people to just know how you feel. Or to expect them to know you are lying when you say everything is fine. They made a mistake and tried to fix it. There are many ways you could have gone about this. And you chose one of the more assholey ways. 
7,b06rs9,t2_16n47k,T1TpoBidprnp,"YtA. You sound like a little kid. Maybe your food was forgotten because you showed up late after the orders were taken. Instead of Alex going back a second time, why could you just order something? Then you don't say anything and just leave! I bet you don't get invited back."
7,a2gry0,t2_xx8jh,Quarterinchribeye,NTA and the 12 year old definitely knows what is happening. If the babysitter were male that person would be locked up.

7,aw7rpq,t2_cc998,TheDutchTank,"YTA. You don’t tell someone that you’re not attracted to them because of something they have no control over. It’s really just a dick move. It’s totally okay not to be attracted to her for that reason, but don’t tell her that to her face dude. "
7,aw7rpq,t2_37kjnhzn,ElaiosAdonaios,"YTA Stop defending yourself. You rejected a disabled person on the basis that she was disabled, and **told her that to her face.** The fact that you don't see why that makes you an asshole, the fact that you even needed to make this post to ask, demonstrates your massive deficiencies of character. >How would we even bang? As others have said, she dodged a bullet. You're disgusting."
7,aw7rpq,t2_r8ih0pb,ochu_,NTA and now your friend is gaslighting you into feeling bad. If she were any type of good friend she would've let you know beforehand. That's a lie by omission.
7,aw7rpq,t2_2pyloibi,FricktasticFox,YTA. It’s honestly fair for appearance to be a decent chunk of attraction but you couldn’t have handled it worse.
7,aw7rpq,t2_l2qlsye,Quria,"YTA There were so many ways to handle it other than ""I was hoodwinked, see ya."" Yes, either of them could have told you about her condition, but that doesn't mean you needed to be a shitlord to her. "

7,aw7rpq,t2_oc2h7,z3bru,"NTA. You were set up. I can see how your response can be seen as shitty, but what else could you have done? If the wheelchair is an issue there is no workaround, no matter how you said it, it would always be awfull for the chick. Thats why people shouldnt hide shit :/"
7,aw7rpq,t2_ilnu4,Bobulatonater,YTA for how you handled it. You don't have to date anyone for any reason but it does make you look shallow.
7,aw7rpq,t2_1z9hcpo,r1Zero,YTA. Not for knowing your limits on who you will date but because you couldn't have utilized some tact in letting her down. 
7,aw7rpq,t2_aqeqo,bott04,YTA-I can understand her wanting to be known for her personality and her intent was not to purposefully hurt you. I cannot say the same for how you handled rejecting her. 
7,aw7rpq,t2_2qzpxthr,golddustwitch,"YTA. Even if that was a problem for you, you could have just been polite and just said you just did not feel like you clicked. "

7,aw7rpq,t2_1gefcs42,ccsherkhan,YTA. Did you really have to say that? You could of just texted her later and said you didn’t feel a connection. What the hell’s the matter with you?
7,aw7rpq,t2_15ebtned,AspartameDaddy317,"YTA because you handled that like, well, an asshole. You could have cut that off with ok it being a dick about it man. Instead you made that girl feel bad about herself. "
7,aw7rpq,t2_hxhcvkp,Jabronskyi,"YTA. Dude! Your tact on this topic is just unreal and unpleasant. Not being attracted is one thing, but what you said... You're a big douchebag"

7,aw7rpq,t2_3bg16ron,bebopandrocksteady88,YTA You rejected her just because you wouldn’t consider a person in a wheelchair. You are unbelievably shallow and I hope she rolled over your toe on the way out. Utter fucking bellend. 
7,aw7rpq,t2_hmo3sn4,terribletyrunt,YTA. You could have just told her you weren't interested. Instead you had to make it about something she can't change and is probably insecure about anyway. 
7,aw7rpq,t2_2nwg0xkq,Island_universe0,"YTA. Why do you care if she's in a wheelchair? I know people always say you're not an asshole if you don't want to date someone because you don't find them attractive, but in this case you did find hee attractive so it's really just the wheelchair. Sorry for people who don't want to admit it but yeah you're an asshole if you don't want to date someone because they're in a wheelchair, what are you worried about? Who cares?"
7,aw7rpq,t2_b175gdp,maddielovescolours,"YTA, I honestly don’t think this is a valid reason to reject someone right off. It’s not like she was lying about having kids or anything that would seriously effect the relationship. How is this a dealbreaker?"
7,aw7rpq,t2_2v5seqj4,kar4256,"NTA. it's shitty of your friend to assume that you'd be ok with being lied to, and it's shitty of the girl who is in a wheelchair to spring that on you. Neither took you into consideration. "

7,as3m0x,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,YTA You kissed another dude. Instead of declining out of respect. I would guess you were 14 if not for the mention of alcohol. Maybe you are 16 and underage drinking. But you still know better. How would you feel?
7,as3m0x,t2_2rx0a5au,troubledcardad,Yta You cheated on him. You humiliated him. You don't have the empathy to even understand why he would be upset. Yikes. He needs to leave you. 
7,b4o3lv,t2_avfnlvf,gurilagarden,YTA - I've done this. I also have done this knowing it was an asshole thing to do. It only makes things worse.

7,aorwnz,t2_4tpk5,sjsyed,"YTA. That’s her dad. If she wants him there, she gets to have him there. You’ll get to dictate who is and is not allowed in the delivery room once you’re the one giving birth."
7,aorwnz,t2_1531yxr0,cosmically_drizzy,YTA- she’s giving birth but at the same time ur NTA because a lot of people don’t mind having MILs in the room but FILs just make it awkward because it’s more of a mother daughter and husband moment but it’s her choice

7,b32ymu,t2_2kqzj3jn,feedbacksandwich,"YTA. I'm surprised you even have to ask. Revenge is wrong, especially over some teenage break up like yours. You have really dropped this girl in the shit."
7,b32ymu,t2_2k24lsce,PasionatelyRational,"YTA and given you have the maturity of a first-grader, you shouldn’t be having any boyfriends either. What you did was done out of spite. It’s disgusting. However no 22 year old should date underage girls so that guy is an asshole too. "
7,ak0zkc,t2_bt3ft,numberthangold,"YTA. Jesus. Would you have made this same comment if you were out with friends or by yourself? You were clearly doing it to try to impress your date. And of course, making it seem like you were going to complain to the manager is a major asshole move. I hope this girl doesn't go out with you again. "
7,ak0zkc,t2_20jino37,selfawaresquare,YTA. I feel like you're the type of guy who will make your girlfriend think you are breaking up with her before -psych!- it's a proposal! Aren't you so happy and grateful!
7,ak0zkc,t2_h5i67,spritanium,Really dude? Of course YTA. You gave this poor waitress a mini heart attack just so you could look like a hotshot a few seconds later. Other human beings are not your pawns.
7,ak0zkc,t2_1n4yr3uz,spacedust94,"YTA. Damn dude I’m cringing. That’s not something you do, especially in that context. If the manager happened to walk past your table or greet you then you could have said ‘hey, that server was awesome!’. The way you did it made it seem fabricated and douchey."
7,ak0zkc,t2_120qxl,loutang10,YTA - third date burgers? Are you 14? You sound like an incel in how you describe your date. You're a beg and a try hard bro. 
7,ak0zkc,t2_13nj3x,Illusionairy,"YTA- you scared the shit out of that poor server on purpose. If she did such an awesome job, what was wrong with saying it to her face, and tipping accordingly? You would have gotten WAY further on all counts if you had just overtipped. "
7,ak0zkc,t2_2elr3rxr,FlippingPossum,YTA. You scared that poor waitress and didn't answer her when she asked about her service. Why the heck didn't you tell HER she provided excellent service then ask to see her manager? 
7,ak0zkc,t2_2belhlsr,Lcmom1231,"YTA! Your date was right, you were totally trying to show off, reading that even made me cringe! How embarrassing. She probably wanted to crawl under the table. "

7,ak0zkc,t2_1vpexz7b,Simply_a_nerd,"IDK what all the you're the assholes are about but NTA, you complimented her and so what if you asked to see her manager that way? In the end everyone was happy and your date was kind of being a bitch. "

7,ak0zkc,t2_p0e0e1j,Browser2025,YTA for wasting everyone's time trying to show off. Managers really don't have time for this. You're so blind you don't even see the problem.

7,ak0zkc,t2_k34pe7z,SellaraAB,"YTA. What a bizarre and anxiety inducing way to compliment your waitress. It seems like you thought it was a kind gesture, but I'm baffled as to why you would approach it like this."
7,ak0zkc,t2_6lharzu,RealityIncoming,"YTA in soooo many ways, it's a bit scary that you don't see it. I'm also guessing you say M'lady a lot too. "
7,ak0zkc,t2_17c778,smellslikefeetinhere,YTA. This reminds me of the dude who took his date to Pizza Hut and asked to give his compliments to the chef.
7,ak0zkc,t2_ls76c,jordankid93,YTA. I was gonna say NTA until you got to the part about how to called for the manager. Definitely a dick way of doin that
7,ak0zkc,t2_tqpxk,mitch_michaels17,NTA I don’t get what the big deal is. You complimented a waitress and scored her some points with her manager. I have seen other people do the same. How could you possibly be an asshole for giving a compliment?
7,ak0zkc,t2_2xffqing,strawberrypockystix,"YTA. Man, if any of my friends or my SO did this, I’d never want to dine out with them again. The waitress 100% thought she was going to get into trouble, and then you made a big show of complimenting her. You could’ve just given her a compliment and then leave a big tip. A big tip would’ve made a difference to her pocketbook."
7,ak0zkc,t2_ri96ab2,TiberDasher,YTA. I get what you were trying to do but it was all around over the top. 
7,ak0zkc,t2_10yv5e,hldsnfrgr,"YTA. That only works in the movies or in tv shows. You can't do that in real life , man. That's kind of like doing a bomb joke in a plane or something. I'm exaggerating, but you get my point."
7,ak0zkc,t2_l9aa1,giny33,YTA. You sound like a control freak. Wtf let her know you want to give a good word in for her instead of freaking her out. 
7,ak0zkc,t2_1ys9obta,usernamechecksout133,"YTA, but not a huge one. I do this a lot, but I quietly ask for the manager up front, not ask the waiter in question to get them."
7,ak0zkc,t2_2bipw92d,Usual_Development,"YTA Kinda I don't know if you did it on purpose, but there were other ways to get the point across, and it could come off as a douchebag move Again, I don't know the exact context, maybe you were not trying to showboat, but it definitely could come off as such. Next time, just leave a big tip. "
7,ak0zkc,t2_2vlbmgvw,randogirl29,"YTA, your poor date probably thought that you were hitting on the waitress. I'd be rippin if my boyfriend ever gushed over a waitress while we were on a date. "
7,ak0zkc,t2_adka6cs,Aquinan,"NTA for what it's worth, it wasn't the best way of doing it sure but everyone here calling you as asshole is nuts. It's not that big a deal. "
7,ak0zkc,t2_s5gjcwu,FriscoHusky,"YTA: You kinda made a big deal out of it, dude. You should have not 1) scared the shit out of the waitress by not telling her WHY you wanted the manager and 2) not done it in front of your date, at the table. You quietly got to either the maître d’ or the waitress station and ask for the manager. Or call the next day. Doing it the way you did really sounds like “hey look at what a nice guy I am! Check me out!”. "
7,ak0zkc,t2_cjtnkbh,jadedwolfie,"YTA. I mean, when the server asked if something was wrong, that was your cue to say that you wanted to give him a compliment. By dangling the compliment by saying ""I just want to speak to your manager"", which by the way, no server wants to hear, you made yourself look like an ass."
7,ak0zkc,t2_84krsdr,throwaway3921218,"YTA for sure. Should have just thanked the waitress a couple times, left a decent tip and left. You tried to flex and it was a bad decision. Hope you didn’t blow it but you might have..."
7,9wzmtq,t2_t0gra,Rivka333,"YTA. She was an asshole too, but you were a far bigger one, as what you did was wildly disproportionate.

Because that was the only thing she did. Asshole."
7,9wzmtq,t2_zehwl,Veritablefilings,YTA for calling the cops afterwards. Knowing you were the one that purposely hit her. She ran off and that should have been the end of it.

7,adrfbl,t2_11c7hval,clutzycook,"YTA: I might have told the kid that you were keeping the ball until his parents came over and could see the damage the kid had caused. Pulling out a knife and cutting the ball in half is too much, IMO."

7,adrfbl,t2_12jlkk,Dingusatemybabby,NTA; You are the villian of their childhood and that is awesome. You warned them and then gave them a great story to tell for the rest of their lives. 
7,adrfbl,t2_kqzj9,Kinerae,YTA. Better option would have been to have the parents and / or kids come over and see that they cut someone bloody with their games.
7,adrfbl,t2_l2oelaf,PorQuepin3,YTA. Arent you an adult? You should have told him to come back with his parents too so you could have talked to them about the damages as well
7,b358s1,t2_1xgi0kx9,immediatethor,NTA. It’s quite unfair for your mother to ask something like that of you. If she’s financially stable and healthy then why on earth would she need you taking care of her? I hope everything works out the way you want it to. 
7,asksij,t2_4xaya,aggibridges,"NTA. I'm a woman, and a femeinist. The comic is hilarious, and the guy is being an oversensitive dick. Ignore those people and enjoy what you like :) "

7,afrsu0,t2_1c45qi9,WillSellOutForKarma,"YTA, this really doesn't matter to you but you went out of your way to call her out. If she was using it to exploit people for more than just likes on Instagram, I would understand it, but no, you had to keep digging at her, you asshole."

7,acww5m,t2_21asixxi,BeefBot9000,Yta and you sound like a douche bag. I doubt this morning was the only factor that lead to her crying. Leave the poor girl alone.
7,acww5m,t2_5w4xb,GuyNoirPI,"YTA Dude, don’t comment on other people’s food when they didn’t ask. Your an asshole for making the comment and an idiot for making it to your girlfriend of all people. "
7,acww5m,t2_2hxmlqpp,arctic-zydrate,"YTA. This shouldn't be a question. She is by no means obligated to follow your diet, and from what you say, it seems like she usually tries to do so. Her eating a sandwich does not affect you...at all... You should really go and give her a hug. "

7,acww5m,t2_994jo,thiscouldbemassive,"YTA. Listen, she doesn't want to be on your diet and that's okay. You can say what you put into your own body, but you can't dictate what she does with hers. That's overbearing and entitled."
7,acww5m,t2_17k94xff,melsellsbells,Yta it's her choice and I also think the way you said it hurt her not only that you judged her

7,acww5m,t2_5n27oy,zipfsch,"YTA you literally judged her food. It's not a talking point on nutrition, it's just shaming, especially when that isn't even a rule, and you're a huge asshole. "
7,acww5m,t2_wqyn0,cernegiant,"YTA. If she wants to eat a breakfast sandwich it's not your goddamn place to comment on it in the middle of her meal. This is why people don't like keto/Palo/vegan dieters, because they can't just shit their mouths."
7,acww5m,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"YTA. You claim to not judge her and the way she eats.. yet.. you comment on it anyways. That's judging it. You LITERALLY told her ""she should not be combining a lot of far with carbs"". Let the girl eat her fuckin sandwich in peace."
7,acww5m,t2_1u2mjum0,Idonutevencare,YTA. She probably feels immensely pressured by you and that sandwich sounds just fine. Why should she eat a ridiculously restrictive diet just because you are?
7,acww5m,t2_2ttin8hs,pancakeman49,"nta she overreacted , but if she was on a diet and this was a cheat day then yta "

7,acww5m,t2_2crhdflm,ItalianMothMan,YTA. I have a feeling the reason she started crying is because you’ve been picking on her for a while.
7,acww5m,t2_4roorqg,SicksTea9,YTA Judging on what I've read so far she needs to be with somebody that has an ounce of chill.
7,acww5m,t2_1wlsojk0,DarkDuck85,"Bruh. B r u h. It would be one thing if SHE was cramming paleo down your throat, but here you are with a very judgey comment on her meal and, she has even been trying to eat paleo JUST FOR YOU. Go to hell. YTA"

She's only 19, fuck, most people don't even move out until their early 20's, not to mention her **legal guardian, and actual parent** wants her to keep living at the house.

7,b1z6r2,t2_9303h,docfarnsworth,"yta, It doesn't sound like she does anything bad. But what really crosses the line is the ""i dont care how she takes it"" and the comment about how you dont care what the mother says because its your house."
7,b1z6r2,t2_u9rrbnb,Smallerbuttercup,NTA does she pay bills? Does she help around? Theres no reason for her to live there if she cant get along with you
7,b1z6r2,t2_kfg0b,Joxan13,"NTA, OP you should drop them and move on. You tried and she's a POS to you for no reason. She's using up your resources while giving you the finger. My opinion is unpopular and I dont care about downvotes. "

7,at6n0h,t2_53r7q,pottersquash,"YTA. You know he has issues, don’t like on. On other hand, be a pal and offer a fun trip to get mutual facials so he can discover how clear his skin can be. Don’t frame it as “you need this” but “let’s do this!”"
7,abzqwn,t2_j741zzz,snartkety,"YTA. But not a major asshole. You should ask or do it outside the house. Vaping still leaves an odor, even if it’s not as bad as smoking. "
7,abzqwn,t2_2tlqxd3z,CuckLab,NTA. You even went to the bathroom so you should be fine. If you know they are hippies then maybe you can ask them if it’s okay to use it in the house. That way you don’t have to hide every time you vape.
7,aoahqr,t2_9eti3,KatFrog,YTA - you can talk to him about his eating habits after you have your own place to eat. 
7,b6v3cj,t2_q808n,Germahy,NTA at all but this reads like a shitpost. She sounds like a shit teacher who takes her real life frustrations out on her students 
7,b49vtm,t2_9q4zy,Korzaz,"NTA. I mean, I don't know what you expected. Your friend is in a shitty situation and the only way it can go from here is physical abuse. Is that what she is looking for before breaking up with him? "

7,atcfa9,t2_37ud0iy2,TempusMotherFugit,"NTA. Just cause she has a shitty life rn doesn’t give her a pass to be a horrible person. If she wants a punching bag she should join a gym, not use you. "
7,atcfa9,t2_9ubsser,throwthestik,"NTA. You owe her nothing, not even friendship, after the way she's been treating you. Let her find out the hard way that she shouldn't be taking her issues out on you."

7,aovzws,t2_17ei81zn,tessah22,"NTA. Your girlfriend is jealous, controlling, and gaslighting you. And she sees no issue with it, so she's not likely to change. "
7,b3chef,t2_37kyjr7b,RazzlleDazzlle,"NTA, your wife’s gotta cut the cord some time. Your marriage should be a priority over your child, tbh. And a lot of times doing what’s good for the child will make them upset and that’s *okay*. Let her cry it out, she’ll survive. Go be with your wife. "
7,b9zxxj,t2_9303h,docfarnsworth,"YTA, this should have come up before she was picked honestly. You’re a bigger asshole if a lot of the wedding shot has be done. "
7,b42h4x,t2_a6sdc,jsrqs1981,NTA - Ya know who shouldn't have kids? People that don't want them. If you and you wife don't want kids that's totally up to you. Your parents are making it about themselves. 
7,b42h4x,t2_2it1nomo,hastur777,"YTA. Their exhortations may be annoying, but cutting someone out of your life is what you do for abuse, not annoyance. I don’t see anywhere where you’ve tried to tell them not to bring this up. "
7,b64p65,t2_iit2wre,aKamikazePilot,NTA. The bigger question though is are you going to take the dog to the vet to get her eye checked out?
7,ab9cnr,t2_1x2st2w,mutherofdoggos,NTA. I don’t even know why she’d want to bring her new man to her old man’s friend’s party.

7,ab9cnr,t2_16981o48,-comfypants,"NTA, but I doubt you'll be able to change her mind on the matter. Considering it's your friend group, she shouldn't attend at all if she's not going with you. "
7,ab9cnr,t2_2q1keymr,The_Dreaded_Candiru,"YTA. > This is my friend group. Not hers. That's not how this works. You don't get exclusive rights to your friends. Stop trying to control everyone around you to suit your preferences. It's up to the host to invite whoever they feel like, and if you have a problem with who's going, it's YOUR problem, not theirs. Is she being awful and inconsiderate? Absolutely. But you don't get to control her behavior, only your own. If you're not okay with seeing her and her new guy, don't go."
7,b5chit,t2_3h4ikvi0,Lucifers__Advocate_,"YTA. If you're not earning commission, that is. You get paid as long as you're there, so how does it really hurt if you answer a few basic questions"
7,akso8m,t2_1aw99oim,lilyandcarlos,YTA: If you put more pressure om him (a Lot of guys panic when they feel pressed into marriage). The pressure he feels from you may be the reason he havent purposed yet. So give him some space. But why do you espect him to purpose? Why cant you pop the question? 
7,azxs23,t2_jp9eeol,mab6644,YTA I understand you had good intentions but she was already traumatized. You should have respected her wishes. It wasn't your place to go to the police.
7,azxs23,t2_72vcua,05632054,"YTA. I get that you had good intentions, but in this case, going to the police was kind of selfish because you did it to appease your own mind and not hers. You didn’t listen to what she’d said, and by taking that choice away from her, you weren’t being supportive. "
7,b8x2bz,t2_7tfy2c,CoastalCerulean,"NTA not at all! Your parents have their priorities all jacked up, and I’m sorry. You deserve to be treated better. Are you working still? Do you have access to food between now and the 15th? "

7,azkzlo,t2_1kfdjj5y,avocado__dip,NTA. It's not like you made them eat it right then and there. They really need to let it go. In most cultures it's the polite thing to overfeed your guests.
7,azkzlo,t2_2b8hzzjp,OrangeDoormat,NTA. You were being a good host and doing something nice. They should have just graciously accepted it even if they didn't want it and never brought it up again.

7,allagl,t2_2gsvs9c5,Kinghyrule90,"You're certainly NTA here, I'd say. If anything your GF is the asshole because she should know how easy you are to work up and still chose to belittle your preference in a vehicle."
7,allagl,t2_7lkvc1g,a-little-sleepy,NTA I think you are in an emotionally abusive relationship and she is gaslighting you - as well as straight out insulting you and your opinions. Don't be around someone like that. 
7,ba8jpv,t2_1t7binh5,00Lisa00,YTA - passive aggressive is never the answer - I repeat - passive aggressive is never the answer. Use your words and say you don't choose to do this. You say you're 16 not a baby but this is truly babyish behavior.
7,ba8jpv,t2_8svb3wc,666-take-the-piss,"NTA for intentionally making your stepdad uncomfortable because he's making you uncomfortable, but... stop. This isn't cool, there are better ways to go about it."
7,ba8jpv,t2_11qbqg,godrestsinreason,"YTA - don't be petty. All you're going to end up achieving is bringing a needlessly sexual element to your relationship with your step dad and making your mother uncomfortable. If you don't want to call him dad, then don't. "
7,ba8jpv,t2_1lvya3g0,crinklebosslava,YTA You think it’s cool to sexualize the situation to make him uncomfortable? How about growing some balls and tell him no you’re not calling him dad
7,ashi8g,t2_pcitxcd,Wikidess,"YTA - you admit to being an attention seeker because you weren't getting enough attention from your friends, and then you got mad at them for calling you out on it. "
7,azdk7v,t2_3an902j6,LatvianSausage,YTA this is weird af assuming this isn't a shitpost. IDK why everyone else thinks its a SHP. There are some creepy ass people who do shit like this so i wouldnt count this off as shitpost. I went to a boarding school and there were people doing this stuff

7,axt156,t2_j9afo,Salt-Pile,"INFO. Who is paying rent/costs? If it is you, then NTA, if you are 50-50, YTA. But the bigger problem here is that you think your gf is a liar and your response to that is to avoid dealing with it directly."
7,a52hhj,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,"NTA for leaving, but you are the asshole for not holding his feet (pun intended) to the fire and MAKING him clean up HIS own fucking mess. You kept trying to keep the peace by saying that you would do it. That makes you an enabler. "

7,ah0a9o,t2_2wzp8r3n,evilrobotlizard,"YTA, why are you rifling through their laundry to find her undergarments? That’s very invasive. They aren’t “shoving” it in your face, you’re invading their privacy and seeking out reasons to be offended. "

7,b9qtbv,t2_2hpu6qea,krill482,NTA You should tell him how he basically kicked you to the curb when you asked for his help during your divorce. Then ask him why he did it. Then decide whether to help or not based on his response.

7,b9qtbv,t2_3ayn3ry6,DirectGoose,NTA - BUT it sounds like his wife is the one who destroyed your relationship with him. If he's divorcing her it's probably worth salvaging the relationship and supporting him.

7,azcxjk,t2_mi8cbqp,crystalinguini,"YTA? Let me get this straight. You're upset that your manager asked you and your coworkers to talk less, and you were so darn insulted that you walked out?? And now you're out of a job. What did you expect to happen after walking off after a reasonable dictation?"
7,a1rpn7,t2_161h0l,FighterWoman,"NTA, but consider if it’s worth picking the fight. If you’ll get the promotion in say 6 months if you behave... you might be better off hiding your frustration."
7,aru0cj,t2_ebqfpe,Watsonmolly,NTA - do whatever you need to protect yourself. You don’t owe either of them anything and nothing about the way your dad behaves is normal or acceptable .
7,atzi2f,t2_2sw4bedd,actualdisasterbi,"NTA Even if your sister is being a spoiled brat, it isn't your place to intervene. You can vent to your parents all you want, but at the end of the day, if they're okay with it, it's their business how they allow her to treat them."

7,ac4m7b,t2_q1b7igf,MrsMinnesota,Nta. If your Mil hadn't been there then I'd say you were the asshole. But how much more can you do? When Mil goes home she's going to have it so much harder so she needs to start getting ready. 
7,amrvzn,t2_32dol4yp,JWilk79,"NTA. You are entitled to be whoever you are and love whoever you want. Be proud, loud, and never stop sticking up for yourself!"
7,b1i2m8,t2_jx7n4s2,thecorninurpoop,"NTA, though I really feel like she should just let you pause it. I always just ask my husband to pause the show if I have something I really want to say or vice versa. That seems like a good compromise to me that hurts no one"
7,ajiru4,t2_16z5g7,BananaFrappe,"YTA. No one can ""make"" your friend speak to her BF. She *chooses* to speak to him. If it bothers you, that is your problem not hers.

7,aet5d9,t2_43y29,RevRaven,"YTA - You can get locks for your room as well. He rents the room, he can do whatever he likes in there. He can let his guest stay in there if he likes.

7,aczngx,t2_aeu6y,stefaniey,"Nta. Your dad chose your stepmom over you, he could have had it the day before if he couldn't wait any longer. "
7,aczngx,t2_ehvq7,power602,"NTA. My advice would be to tell him how much it hurts you. He is trying to act like it's not a big deal, so make sure he knows that it is a big deal. Don't feel sorry for him if he feels guilty, because he very much should. Honestly, if I were you, I'd feel like he chose her over you, which would be an awful feeling. Good luck."
7,ay4n6k,t2_5w97v,CarolineTurpentine,"NTA your father needs to find a spine to tell his wife to treat you with respect. We all have ratty childhood keepsakes, tell that bitch to keep her claws off of your shit. "

7,b2k3jm,t2_2iewqp9u,Muse_asvhedu,NTA. She’s being pinched. She didn’t bite the kid. She didn’t even tell him off. She showed him the natural consequence of being a dick in literally the least harmful way possible. In my opinion she handled it fantastically. 
7,aero46,t2_1lvc81je,P_Flange,"NTA. One thing you probably should have done is texted this girl and let her know what was going on. If he was trying to get you to do that, imagine what else he had going on or had planned."
7,ab4hn4,t2_2osjz7z6,SharpShel,"NTA. And seriously wtf is wrong with your SIL? She really had her mommy call and ask y’all to babysit? She sounds like she has a lot of growing up to do. And honestly, your MIL is running the risk of putting herself in a bad situation if she keeps inserting herself into situations like this. She needs to tell her daughter (the SIL, not your wife) to clean up her own messes. Enjoy your kid free holiday!"
7,ab4hn4,t2_1l7pljw,nikosteamer,"NTA by any stretch of the imagination , you don't ask people a day before to babysit and then throw a tantrum because they won't drop their plans. Why doesnt the mother in law do it ? "

7,ar35jn,t2_118bl9,annualgoat,"NTA. She CHOSE to disregard and disrespect your identity for a religion she found, AFTER she had shown you nothing but respect and love when you came out. It's a slap to the face, honestly. She hurt you and will continue too until she apologizes or changes her mind. "
7,ar35jn,t2_1i5a6jfm,iforgotmyanus,"NTA she sucks. If a crooked and bigoted interpretation of religion allowed her to dead name and misgender you, then religion can hold her hand through this tough time. She made her bed. "

7,aije30,t2_yzg839y,AliceChaine,"NTA. Cats can’t clean up after themselves, especially without a clean litter. It was part of the job, and she knowingly didn’t do it. You owe her nothing. She didn’t do her job. Instead, she should be paying you back for damages. "
7,aije30,t2_twobymu,Watachan,"NTA. It sounds to me like this girl did the strict minimum to get her paycheck. She definitely didn't care if she was caught, she probably thought she would have the money anyway. In my opinion, if you need to pay her, she only gets HALF the money at best. The other half would be to cover for the damages. May this girl NEVER have a pet, because if that's how she treats someone else's... yeah :/"
7,aije30,t2_2f05g2f7,NerdInA_Bottle,"NTA!!! The poor kitten! :( It was her task, if she didn't feel up for it, she shouldn't have taken the job!"

7,b43kef,t2_2jpw6b55,Renyard-III,"NTA, it’s your choice to include someone in your life or not and it sounds like she doesn’t deserve to be. "

7,arun8w,t2_iths4,Bunny36,NTA. It seems like you are not in a polyamorous relationship right now and I really don't understand why your husband wouldn't think to double check. In that situation I would also feel cheated on.
7,arun8w,t2_g07hk,AndrewWaldron,YTA. You should have paid more attention to the gift you were giving. You getting mad at and quilting him is f'd up. You created this whole mess and now want to hold it against him.

7,b14bpm,t2_2mbc2jbq,Neurotica_XOXO,"YTA and petty. You basically said ""you deserved real pain and possibly abuse because you bailed on some random dude you barely know"" which is ridiculous "
7,a3kdx6,t2_17xdk4gq,cityzombie,NTA. His girl isn't a damn child and her responsibilities are not yours to take on... He should automatically be doing her share if he doesn't want to have her do it. This is ridiculous. 
7,a4eg7e,t2_118c1a,neuroctopus,"YTA, not for being mad, but for yelling at someone. You had every right to say you were angry in a calm voice, which is what classy people do. But having said that, I'm sorry you hate your hair! That sucks!"
7,avx7zw,t2_xu9ys,TigerKirby215,"ESH, leaning on NTA - Kid was stupid but he's just a kid and you should've probably been more careful. Kid was ultimately responsible for running into you but you should've been more careful."
7,avx7zw,t2_go17jff,TheThiccBreadsticc,"Ehhhhhhh... YTA for biking too fast in an area with a bunch of other people around, but if you were getting harassed by bystanders, and the mom said it was okay, your fine by leaving. NTA in the way you handled the situation."
7,b7ko06,t2_3b7l9acc,bored_german,NTA. Emotional abuse is horrible and you have every right to ghost her for it. I wish I had your backbone to go NC with my father.
7,b7ko06,t2_1e2krssr,bigrottentuna,NTA. You get to decide who you want in your life and it sounds like you have good reason for wanting to get some distance from her.
7,b7ko06,t2_1ds0jy6,sjsto,"NTA. Letting toxic people go is a good thing. I know a lot of people think ghosting is wrong, but honestly it gives you a clean break. Narcissists won't heed your explanation anyway, so don't waste your time or your air giving one."
7,awwmsy,t2_99wmj,TenthSpeedWriter,"YTA. It's ultimately her decision; what you want for her doesn't matter here. There's a chance she'll regret it but it's her choice to regret, not yours."
7,awwmsy,t2_2jbhcee2,CrookedHalos,"YTA Yes, you would be TA if you told her that. You wrote a whole lot about what you want in your post, so your motives don't come across as caring for her but rather judging by what you want. She's an adult and is making the decision. Your role is to be there for her and support her. "
7,awwmsy,t2_1kfdjj5y,avocado__dip,"YTA. If she did not ask for your opinion, don't give it to her. It doesn't matter what you want for her, she is not a child."
7,b8cqym,t2_9rai1,lPFreeIy,"NTA, I've skipped a few funerals for professional reasons. You're not doing the guy any good by going to his funeral anyway"
7,a6jc38,t2_17u10d6r,Ontvx,"NTA. If I was pregnant I’d ask my friend to get back up instead of bothering a stranger. You’re not really obligated to give up a seat, it’s just nice to. But she had a seat and gave it up. "
7,a6jc38,t2_6zb4t,adenovellis,"NTA. Currently 8 months pregnant myself. If standing is such a bother, she shouldn't have given up her seat. The friend is a huge douche hole for doing that shit to you. I would have reamed her out if it was my friend. There are plenty of other people on the bus she could have politely asked but she obviously wanted to sit next to her friend."
7,a6jc38,t2_16gtsl,cbh28,"NTA. The friend should have stood up and let the pregnant woman sit down. These two women are the assholes in this situation, harassing you and even touching you without your permission. "
7,a6jc38,t2_2qvoustv,SiriusLeeBlackk,NTA she had a seat and she gave it up. That’s her choice. She doesn’t get a free pass at any seat she wants on the bus. 
7,a6jc38,t2_18spsbe,Ummah_Strong,"Hahah good clickbait title, but nah. Like bruh, NTA she should have given the pregnant friend her seat back"
7,a6jc38,t2_28rfx40m,Platitude_Platypus,"NTA. To be honest, I was all ready to call you the asshole but this story is very different than I guessed. Nobody has the right to touch you like that, or demand your seat, or belittle you and get in your face. Fuck them. "
7,a6jc38,t2_1qbsisn0,Dingo-thatate-urbaby,"NTA. I'm pregnant and I don't expect anyone to give up their seat for me. If they do, cool, if not, well that sucks but it isn't gonna kill me."
7,a6jc38,t2_2it1nomo,hastur777,NTA - the friend should have given the pregnant lady her seat back. You don’t get special seat privileges just because you’re a woman. 
7,a6jc38,t2_z5yzru1,vamoose01,"NTA the way they took the earphone out was just rude, and they could have switched within them if they wanted a seat."
7,a6jc38,t2_hoe7bkd,physioworld,"NTA. She should give up her own seat and certainly not be so rude and presumptuous about it. EDIT: reading through some comments, people are calling the pregnant lady the asshole here, when the real villain is her non pregnant friend. There’s some really nasty things being said about pregnant women. "
7,a6jc38,t2_t2tyry6,jippyzippylippy,"NTA - she had an available seat and her friend, who is a total, giant, assaulting asshole, didn't give it to her."
7,a6jc38,t2_ziz80to,GondorfTheG,"NTA, you refused to give up your seat for the pregnant lady's friend, not the pregnant lady."
7,a6jc38,t2_2i9erjlr,BulimicPlatypus,"NTA. It’s game time the second they touch your stuff. I’d have told her to go fuck herself. It’s not your problem she’s pregnant, it’s her decision and she can deal with it. "
7,a6jc38,t2_aszf2,pineapple-face,"NTA the friend sounds like a childish, pathetic person for treating you like that. They both sound entitled. Get a fucking grip, the world doesn’t revolve around you. "
7,a6jc38,t2_111o2n,IncredibleGonzo,"Hell no you're NTA. I mean, if she cared that much about her friend she would have got up and let her sit down. But then it would turn into you giving your seat to her, not the pregnant one, and then they wouldn't be able to guilt you about it. These people are grade-A petty assholes."
7,b3y6ym,t2_34zth5fe,alwaystired7,NTA. And quit saying he was “great” during the relationship cause obviously he was not. He cheated on you and lied about money. How is that great? Get what you deserve and fuck that guy.
7,b3y6ym,t2_1tu3zy25,Modulas,NTA - I don’t think you can do much about her dating if you’re going through a divorce but if she is lying to you about money etc then don’t get pushed over by it and just go through the legal process.
7,a0gx48,t2_2nwruvk7,undergroundanchor,"I hesitate to say this, but I think YTA. You didn't have to pay it back because it was to go to a fence that you would have to pay for. You didn't have to pay for the fence. So now you've gotten $4,000 that was originally a loan, and converted it into a gift. Sorry dude. Pay the sister back please. "
7,agao4z,t2_2i0z1tcj,Oilfreeeggs,"Nta. She sounds very immature and fucking stupid. Who in their right mind would do that?? Honestly dump her, being in a relationship shouldn't be this hard, its meant to be fun."
7,agao4z,t2_gj58o7r,angedorable,"Wow she sounds toxic as hell. you're NTA but i think you should reevaluate your relationship with her. If she can joke about something as horrific as rape, then there must be something terribly wrong with her. "
7,agao4z,t2_a2ikq,TheMadFlyentist,"NTA, incredibly immature and stupid thing to do on her part. Even if her story is totally true (about it being a prank or test), that's not a good sign. Adults don't put their SO's through traumatizing tests to determine loyalty. Cut your losses mate, she sucks."
7,b47k4y,t2_3g3vz7cl,Bob5551234,"NTA for wanting your friend to have a better life for herself. However, if you tell her this, maybe it'll be the reality check she needs, or maybe she won't listen and it will end your friendship. Hard choice. "
7,b47k4y,t2_f43oi,Jootmill,"NTA she’s made her bed and now she has to lie in it, if she chooses to keep the baby. I certainly wouldn’t be quick helping her out financially when it all crashes down."
7,alvy2p,t2_2c7bbavr,just_growing,YTA only because you should've just broken it off when you realized you weren't interested anymore
7,alvy2p,t2_2ybip8xi,Samwiseisthebest,NTA. She needs serious mental health help and you can't provide that. You need to distance yourself from this situation so you don't get sucked back in. Take care of yourself. 
7,9v4byn,t2_2icjq5th,Ciderxi,"NTA, I wish I could give good advice, but I'm well informed in legal stuff. Best of luck, give her a weeks notice to leave. Once that's up, change the locks"
7,as6ij3,t2_xsinm8u,sloretactician,NTA. I hope you bought the service/replacement plan because your sister is gonna destroy it the second your back is turned 
7,b8qalq,t2_2qtkiafo,miriamness,NTA I’m so sorry that your church is treating you like this. Be who you are. “Real” Christians are accepting of others and don’t shun you for what they have perceived to be a “sin.” Jesus loves you for who you are.
7,b8qalq,t2_3emwevaf,c-est-magnifique,NTA Tell her she doesn't have to choose but they make you feel unwelcome and unwanted. You don't want to help people who don't want your help. 
7,aeuvkb,t2_1lvc81je,P_Flange,"NTA. You set boundaries, she violated them, then she used your reaction to her poor behaviour as a reason to break up with you. You're better off without that kind of person in your life."
7,aeuvkb,t2_1vyvm387,FemaleIsEasyMode,"NTA. You don't want to know, she forced you. It was probably better for you that the breakup happened."
7,aeuvkb,t2_11wx1h,S4rd0nyx,"NTA - It sounds like she may have been trying to make you jealous or mess with your head a bit. No matter what she was doing, those are some major red flags. "
7,aymrjt,t2_2ybbaqlp,OrneryNerves,"NTA. Like you said, he can do it if he wants to do it. You don’t have to if you don’t want to do it. "
7,b6yesp,t2_e2vx5,SecondHandToy,"NTA. Leopards don't change their spots just because they have cubs. Also... She sounds like a shitty friend too. Demanding everything be about her, but not providing support when you need it in turn. Maybe you need a new best friend. "
7,ar7pf6,t2_2kpxvef3,SnowyBug,"NTA If you don't like it, then you stop. She'd say the same thing if it were her. Just because she doesn't mind being roped into it, doesn't mean you do. You tried. Didn't work. She's TA, not you. "
7,ar7pf6,t2_30hzwx1h,ERArcher,NTA Although its obvious you know that you're not the asshole. My advice. Sit her down and explain to her in a serious talk that you do NOT like being tied up and explain why. If she doesnt respect that you are your own person and you dont like that particular thing then shes a foolish person. 
7,ar7pf6,t2_28m7omed,tall-not-small,YTA. Not for saying no but because you sound like a right bitch. Maybe you should just let her take control because you sound like a woman
7,akeb1y,t2_1m0abdfm,LivingAtAltitude,"NTA She's an irresponsible pet owner and neighbor. However have your dad deal with this, it's his responsibility to deal with her, it shouldn't be your burden."
7,b3ujn6,t2_121yej,Gingersalad622,"YTA. Dude, you’re asking someone who seems paralyzed in fear who clearly needs your support to essentially just “calm down”. Nightmares can feel real and terrifying for some people. Give her some love and support sometime. Why is that so difficult for you?"
7,b3ujn6,t2_3fqlptjz,Pre-PA-cs,YTA- it sounds like she had sleep paralysis and couldn't move/couldn't easily move until it was over. Your anger is misplaced concern for her wellbeing but it doesn't make you a lesser asshole since you directed it at her. 
7,b3ujn6,t2_1ii6hmcl,ufruitloopdingus,YTA she cant control it and she cant help worrying about it what do u expect her to do not sleep?!?!? 
7,b751z6,t2_g7knv1f,jolie178923-15423435,"YTA Seriously, you're jealous that your GF has inside jokes with her sister and they get silly together. you're something else."
7,b751z6,t2_1zta0p42,MommaBearJam,YTA it's her sister for God sake.. oh no they have inside jokes that you don't get! It's ok for her to have people over and you not be the center or the universe.
7,b751z6,t2_1to0qqa2,MikkiTh,YTA But it sounds like you'll soon not have to worry about either of them being there
7,b751z6,t2_2no0dwup,MizzGee,"YTA. The key word in the description is OUR place. You can't expect her to cut her sister out of her life. You are seeing things in her that you don't like, but they are still her. She is an equal in this relationship, an equal as a roommate. "
7,b751z6,t2_12ds7s,ThriftyLizzie27,YTA- it's not just your apartment. And that's her sister. I mean it sounds like you're a tad jealous of their inside jokes....
7,b02ce1,t2_i7n41,CherubRocker89,"NTA - this jerk's putting you at risk of losing the roof over your head for no good reason. You tried to confront him about it, he didn't do anything to fix the issue. You have to cover yourself now."
7,b9ymhl,t2_js8yh,Chinoiserie91,"NTA, I guess they got used to using the attraction card so forgot they had already said they would have sex so contradicted themselves."
7,b9ymhl,t2_1eqjzkk9,JamesTheCrab,Ok if he said he isn’t into black people that’s one thing but he said you guys are lower status? Wtf def NTA what a racist 
7,affiwd,t2_2j1g9sp1,pokinthecrazy,NTA. Sounds like your mom dumped a lot of shit on you and then expects you to be happy about it.
7,adasdz,t2_19y5d689,lezlers,NTA Your friend is being selfish and rude AF. You spent all this time and effort ON CHRISTMAS to make this cake for her son and that’s how she acts? I’d write her off. 
7,b8gri1,t2_17ook31b,PiratedPanties,"YTA.. Because you yelled and threw things at your grandmother. You had the right to be upset since she made you sick and scared, but you over-reacted. I don't think she really understands how serious your illness is either. I'd take her with you to your doctor and have her explain that this is serious. "
7,ak9cda,t2_cincr,iBeFloe,"NTA. You’re still letting him come. You just don’t want him to be IN it. I’m sure she loves you, but this girl is carrying her feelings around like they’re a button collection. Sounds like she easily crushes on people too, which would be annoying in a marriage. I hope she stops..."
7,ak9cda,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"YTA You're marrying a girl who openly tells you she has crushes on other guys, and because of this isn't sure she can be in a relationship. You're telling her it's ""normal"", and then you're telling her he can't be in the wedding as a friend. Make up your mind. "
7,aj9gju,t2_2uvz222r,ihateyouindinosaur,"I'm gonna say NTA, even though I don't know anything about your mom. You aren't obligated to feel anything for anyone. Embrace the positive relationships in your life and weed out the toxic. Maybe one day you will be differently but in the meantime it is okay to feel the way you feel <3"
7,b1o9ea,t2_3cjdzjnm,covertassembly,Nta. Sometime the only way she can learn is by him hurting her....some people just cant listen to others. It sucks but its the truth. Tell her you think he is a POS. 
7,b9xtxo,t2_aj5h0,Shortandsweet33,"NTA, and the fact that a 15 year old is acting like this is truly disturbing. I was thinking he was 7 or something. That kid needs to grow up fast. At 15 he can go buy his own damn jello, Jesus Christ!"
7,b9xtxo,t2_c7d8d,Ngamoko,NTA. At 15 brother should understand that you can't always get what you want. (Get well soon Sir Mick.) He's being a bit of a brat. &#x200B; And good for you for protecting your wife.
7,9wxkqq,t2_2it1nomo,hastur777,YTA. You don't know how people are going to react to this. You could end up causing them to swerve or crash.
7,b4kaz2,t2_32ek64ix,starredandfeathered,"NTA - You’re way nicer than I’d have been. Wtf is wrong with your coworkers though? No one should be calling at 4:30 am unless they’re in danger, need help, or they’ve won the lottery and they’re splitting it with you. "
7,b4kaz2,t2_4m8kx,kabrandon,"Eh, NTA but maybe silence your phone while you're sleeping? Seems like a reasonable solution to life's problems here."
7,b4kaz2,t2_1l4zliw,AuntKikiandtheBears,"NTA he was trying to do a booty call, fuck him. You were very nice if you ask me. I don’t answer the phone when I’m in bed unless we see it’s our girls or my sister, everyone else can fuck off. "

7,b4kaz2,t2_1dss259n,egalex,"NTA as a person who loves sleep I can safely say you were wayyyy too nice, and I'm not sure what our coworkers are doing"
7,b4kaz2,t2_31o9hv7m,MusicalTheatre_Nerd,"NTA. It was 4:30 in the morning, he should know that most people dont wake up that early, especially since he knew your schedule. Also I'm guessing you were tired"
7,b4kaz2,t2_y1ht2,shanep3,"NTA, but why don’t you put your phone on do not disturb? Hell I have my phone on do not disturb even when I’m awake most of the time."
7,b4kaz2,t2_224a0cxm,tjstrider,"NTA your response was very normal, your friends are dense to think otherwise, he’s a creep and shouldn’t message you at 6am let alone 4:30am! "
7,b4kaz2,t2_1a21konw,mauionabreakaway,NTA. A surprise would have been a cute text for you to wake up too. This is just rude of him. I'd have blocked his ass and forgotten about him five minutes later.
7,b7cm7g,t2_17f9zg5,TheUnstoppableAnus,YTA. Be honest with your parents and quit making excuses. Highschool isn't as hard as you think. You have the time. Everyone who puts in the effort does fine. AP classes aren't special
7,aa5qsy,t2_2lqbrznk,iwasthebread,"NTA - it’s up to you and your girlfriend to decide what works for you two. So unless she’s the one telling you she’s not happy with what you pay for, ignore it. "
7,az7xly,t2_31afgbp6,PetiteSelene,NTA. Dude. What the fuck. Why would he snatch stuff out of your hand? Give him the boot because that is full on butthole behavior. He is an infected butthole. Tell him and then leave. Douch bag. 
7,av4so5,t2_37kjnhzn,ElaiosAdonaios,"NTA If your employer could make one extra dollar by firing you, they would. Don't be a fool. You don't owe them anything."
7,av4so5,t2_315ibws0,Bophus5,"NTA you work for a company and if that company could replace you with a cheaper person, they would do it in a heartbeat. I hope You get the new job. Good luck. "
7,av4so5,t2_5w5wl,nkdeck07,"NTA, your current employer would fire you in a heartbeat if it made business sense. I'd talk to your friend about it just to give them the heads up but you aren't an asshole here. "
7,av4so5,t2_f5f49,MisterNoisy,NTA. Your employer doesn't give a fuck about you so any fucks you give about them are unearned.

7,aopv5x,t2_os6a3,Birdy1072,"YTA. Even if the dude was a dick, you also acted out in a way that hurt your restaurant. Your manager is right to be pissed at you. "
7,aopv5x,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,"YTA. No matter how crappy your customer is and how fake their card seems, you don't publicly humiliate them by announcing that their card has been declined. You absolutely should have let him handle the card situation. This was awful customer service on your end."
7,aopv5x,t2_nqdpa0b,TCD89,"NTA, most of these people here never have worked in the service industry. Fuck dumbass show offs and their bullshit. You hurt your pocket, but if you felt better about it. Then.....fuck em."
7,aopv5x,t2_ap24l,robotteeth,"YTA. I'm not saying that you're a bad person, but if you get your petty revenge, you have to accept the 'petty' part of it. "
7,aopv5x,t2_2utr216d,A3D17T,NTA It's not your fault his card was declined. Maybe the guy shouldn't have been such a prick to his server. Or maybe he shouldn't be going out to eat a $1200 dinner that he can't pay for. And also he's even more of an asshole for not checking the bill before leaving. 
7,aopv5x,t2_1qwwagqg,MBLBOSS,"YTA. You don't work at a denny's off the highway; you work at an upscale restaurant. If I paid $1200 for a meal and got slammed like that by the waiter, I would be so angry. If I was the owner of that resturaunt, I would have fired you for that. You should be kissing their ass for that kind of tab."
7,a7riiy,t2_bdxuc,IDUNNstatic,"YTA. If she wants kids, and you don't, and she doesn't want to go on the pill and you CLEARLY are too dumb to use a rubber then stop fucking her. Jesus. Use a condom. "

7,a7riiy,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,"YTA. Don't be stupid, use a fucking condom next time. Being mean and forcing her to take it makes you the asshole no matter what. "
7,ajvsji,t2_ridn7,Stinkehund1,"YTA. If she's trusting you with tying her up and holding a knife to her throat, it means she's most certainly trusting you not to kinkshame her for it. Dickmove on your part."
7,ajvsji,t2_10sova,NateDevCSharp,NTA. You're just saying in a joking matter like oh lmao u need to see a therapist and she gets mad at that like it's clearly a joke lol
7,b2417c,t2_qfv30,Chrysoptera,NTA. Your mother overstepped so hard she can't even see the line anymore. I'm guessing this is not the first time she's done something like this. 
7,a4lpmh,t2_1qzqxtpj,hazel8733,"NTA. If your mom persists in saying this, ask the aunt if she wants it back. She’ll probably say no, and then your mom can’t keep telling you to give it to her"
7,a4lpmh,t2_2icjq5th,Ciderxi,"Wait wait wait, if I give someone money as a gift, to help them out, I don't expect that money back. It's not a loan unless you ask for it, and specify that it's a loan. What kind of cunt does that? Nta"
7,a4lpmh,t2_zmjh74j,Bangbangsmashsmash,"NTA, maybe consider asking your aunt if she wants to be paid back, I’d assume she doesn’t expect it, and TBH, I probably would not offer, but if it saves the relationship with your mom, maybe it’s worth it"
7,a4lpmh,t2_lgo1l12,whackadont,"YTA. At least offer (sincerely) to pay your Aunt back, but you definitely should pay your mom back. College is important, but your mom's trying to teach you character. That lesson is more valuable than whatever you owe her. "
7,ajlhzq,t2_qyxb0,Zorthak_Fireaxe,"NTA, no question. Michelle is an outright scumbag for shit-talking your boyfriend to your face like that. You are absolutely correct in telling Ryan not to trust this lying bitch."
7,aysv7i,t2_1yk6ks63,parentheses_robustus,"YTA Your friend was being kind of a prick, you played ball by saying he mustn't eat much good pizza, and then you took things way too far by calling his family ""white trash."" That's not how you should talk to your friends/about their family."
7,aysv7i,t2_6lij3ar,pmmeyourhijab,NTA for not liking it but u still sound like an asshole. There was no reason to call him white trash and stop acting like you have superior taste in pizza. All you had to say was that you don’t like Little Ceasars and just not eat it.

7,acpcxn,t2_2ru46332,MozartsGhostWasTaken,YTA - I don't feel justification is needed the post says it all. But you will lose interest in someone who got sick. Seems very petty. To be honest everything I read seems like asshole behaviour to me. 
7,b6s66d,t2_cp6h53j,The_B0FH,NTA. It's normal and healthy to take time to restablish boundaries and heal. The ex just wants you to be what he wants you to be with no concern for your needs. That's not the mark of a friend. He's TA here. 
7,b15jrf,t2_punl9,forester93,"YTA, you keep asking their opinions and they are giving you an honest answer. Plus your sister shows that she *does* care about you by asking why you're upset and saying she loves you."

7,9uouyt,t2_e9wn07w,BlowsyChrism,NTA Fuck that guy he needs to get off his lazy ass and work. She's working two jobs and he can't even work one? What a joke. 
7,9uouyt,t2_fg4o4,svecer,"NTA. Good for you. Her husband is a deadbeat and he's leeching off your daughter. Besides, you all had an agreement, the fact he's welching on that makes him way worse than a child. "
7,ammq8m,t2_deuyp12,thesugarslug,"NTA. But listen to me. He’s cheated. You cannot trust him and you know this. It wouldn’t be fair to string him along while you decide. Get the process started to leave while he’s inpatient, safe, etc. "

I don’t blame you if you’d been upset or disappointed, but to actually be angry with him is an asshole move. He didn’t like it. He shouldn’t have to haul around HIS gift for YOUR feelings. "

7,abms7w,t2_p6o96m6,nwi210,"NTA. It’s your kid, and no other person should force your kid to eat something non-vegan. That being said, please, for the love of God, don’t force your child to be vegan just because you are. If your child wants to be vegan, then it’s all fine, but if your child doesn’t want to be vegan then let her eat what she wants. My parents didn’t eat red meat before I was born but they didn’t force that upon me, and I’m so glad they didn’t. "
7,abms7w,t2_2e2pi0ey,Aloha-Potato,YTA - Humans are omnivores. The kid will likely resent you for the vegan garbage. Its your personal choice to be vegan.... You have denied your kid the same choice

7,b0pkn7,t2_4yyl3,z0mbiegrl,YTA. I understand why you feel the way you do about your ex's family... but this isn't about you. It's about your son and he wants the people he cares about at his party. He himself extended the invite.

7,b0pkn7,t2_119desk6,inclinedtoisolate,"NTA If these people treated you poorly then you are under no obligation to invite them into your home, even if it is for your son's party. You're not trying to say he's not allowed to ever see them you're just saying you don't want them in your home, and I see nothing wrong with that."
7,b0pkn7,t2_96b2sr9,The_Eggs_Man,"Sooo NTA &#x200B; You shouldn't be forced to associate with asshole people just because they're related to the kid, having 2 birthdays aren't traumatic unless they are forced to be, they want a party?

7,b0pkn7,t2_o6q913s,MattTheSmithers,YTA - I had to read no further than “they didn’t provide *me* any support.” Newsflash: your son’s birthday is not about you or who did or did not take your side during a divorce.

No one, NO ONE, has the right to touch you ANYWHERE, ANYHOW, without your consent.

7,b1266d,t2_cp6h53j,The_B0FH,NTA. Your primary responsibility as a parent is to keep your child safe. The fact that she's ok with putting your child in danger rather than try to retrain or re-home the dog is a huge red flag. Your wife needs to get her priorities straight. You have to do whatever it takes to protect the kid. 
7,b1266d,t2_51y93,burritopete,"YTA - not because you want to get rid of the dog, but taking it without consent of your wife would create a huge trust problem.

7,b1266d,t2_qc3ok,_kalebb_,"NTA-you've done almost everything you can but your wife won't budge when your son's safety is an issue. Tell her she's gotta choose between the dog and her son because they can't coexist and if you call CPA that she won't get rid of a biting dog,she won't have custody anymore."
7,b1266d,t2_32evy,krunk7,"If the dog’s a biter and there’s babies in the house, the dog has to go. NTA"
7,b1266d,t2_12q33p,GhastyGaster,NTA take the little bastard out to the woods and put him down. Make sure he’s never found and tell your wife he ran away. Problem solved.
7,a90egv,t2_ebqfpe,Watsonmolly,NTA - you did him a favour and he’s acting like it’s the other way around. 
7,a90egv,t2_2u5xpl8e,weird_flex_buto_k,NTA. He’s totally the asshole for not paying up and saying you’re one for asking for your money back after giving him ample time.
7,a3jowo,t2_11wknm,ALongAssName,"NTA, hes a leech and you just want the best for you mum. Youre doing what any good son would do"
7,9vgjtz,t2_1xmuoznt,junkfoodmama,So you just blew her off? YTA!! You could have met up with her to help with her school work and been clear about not being interested in her. You didn't need to blow her off what a dick move!
7,b5swgw,t2_1jcos8f,pm1966,"NTA That said, if you don't like it, find your own place. I assume you're still living at home, which is why they're giving these responsibilities to you. At 20, you should be able to find your own place and tell your parents to piss off when they tell you what to do."
7,b5swgw,t2_ojhtc,TurnOneSolRing,"NTA. Your parent's children are not your responsibility. It's also pretty damn sexist to put this all on you. They decided to have the kid, not you. They need to step up."
7,b5swgw,t2_1ech4wjg,wowdrama,"NTA. You have to put your foot down and say ""No."" You're not a parent, you're a sister. Make plans to leave your house as soon as possible, I know it isn't an easy feat as someone who did it myself. And god, what is with that sexist rhetoric? I am so sorry OP."
7,b5swgw,t2_2bswm839,Skullbearer55,NTA hell no. Your parents are sexist dips hits and your brother is probably going to get scurvy when he tries to live by himself. Ditch them.
7,b5swgw,t2_vlrj3c3,Witheer,"NTA, it’s seems your parents are using you. I would get out of there as soon as possible. Just because you are related doesn’t mean that you have to do everything for them."
7,akk8ii,t2_10y034,centrafrugal,NTA. The fucker should have cleaned up and made food for you instead of waiting for you to come home and make him dinner.
7,akk8ii,t2_2u37vi4r,PacayPaco,NTA- he is gaslighting you and being petty. My guess is that there is a deeper issue going on. Good luck.
7,b6mwj4,t2_tymcq,MrSnowflake2,"NTA! I don't mean to overstep, but I do a little photoshop as a hobby. I'd be happy to touch up that pimple (free of charge of course). PM me :)"
7,b5u6ss,t2_1t2fmzsq,waywardwinchesters79,"NTA. It’s no biggie, you weren’t in a committed relationship, so you don’t need to go on a date with her. However, her reply was rather rude which makes her TA. "
7,appwg6,t2_2fc7pmk2,Vulturedoors,"YTA. Guys can't hang off of a girl unless she lets them. Also, you're not her dad. She's free to make choices that might be unwise, and then you have to decide whether you want to put up with it. You either trust her or you don't. My advice would be to trust her. If you can't, then you shouldn't be with her in the first place. "
7,a4jvqx,t2_wapd6bo,HalfPintMarmite,"NTA. She sounds very trying. You don't have to spend more time with her than you have to, but try and be kind. She obviously has some major issues she has to work out. "
7,b92jvc,t2_2bpuuiv0,inevitablegirlie,"YTA. I was tempted to go with ESH, but you're openly saying you don't care that much about jokes about your vision, which means you're the only one being hurtful here."
7,b2bllp,t2_zwboh,whatthefrelll,"NTA, you were a scared kid and didn't know who it even was before you lashed out. Don't let it bug you, you are clearly remorseful and didn't mean to hurt a disabled child. "
7,a4qk01,t2_zr7kx3b,odenb5,NTA. No one is required to be in your life just because they have a mental illness. You have to do what’s best for you. 
7,aaglti,t2_yodliv1,WaffleHouseNeedsWiFi,The irony is that he uses too much TP to avoid touching shit. Also: NTA. He digs through feces regularly. I wouldn't want that in or on me. Fuck all that.
7,aaglti,t2_1dvwzi9,Baby-Baphomet,"Nta, yuck!!! Also I would say nah if he kept that shame to himself and didn't share it with you. Gross af"
7,aaglti,t2_1m536yla,d0ffrot,NTA D I S G U S T I N G. You are a saint for even asking if your an ass. DUMP HIM. You clearly are in a long term relationship with a SOCIOPATH and will more than likely stab you to death shortly. Wtf. My mind is sad :( 
7,aursly,t2_1x2q50ve,JuicyPluot,"NTA. If he had nothing to hide, he wouldn’t have reacted so defensively when you asked a simple question. I agree that what you requested is common in any long term, committed relationship, IMO. To be honest, I don’t think he’s telling you the whole truth here. "
7,aursly,t2_14r0rcp0,Super-Chick,NTA- I’m sorry but he takes his computer into the bathroom with him when he showers? The hell? I got a feeling he’s hiding something from you but it doesn’t need to be awful but he’s hiding something.
7,aflq8d,t2_216gmwf5,bmolsen86,YTA. Not yours to take and I don’t believe they would have went to the trash can. He even asked you not to do it and you still did it. 
7,aflq8d,t2_1tzq9iyk,spectra27,"YTA, they weren’t yours to take. Your dad wanted them left there you should have. You don’t know if no one was gonna smoke them. You don’t know if your dad wanted the extras to go to the groom. Seems kinda self centered of you. "
7,ayyvrw,t2_35ab3ctp,MartinMcshagger,"YTA, I suppose your shit doesn't stink and you were a complete angel when you were 3, are you by any chance an only child?"
7,ay6qms,t2_2t1hfb3u,SpinPsycho,"NTA - but instead of trying to get your hubby to drop him, you should tell him how you feel about BF insulting you and your kids. Let him know that it bothers you, and ask him to resolve it one way or another. BF is not a good friend, and H isjt a good husband if he dismisses how BF makes you feel. "
7,ay6qms,t2_2215yimg,Spicymayogoddess,"NTA, BF sounds like such a toxic person and shitty friend. Why is your husband even friends with a guy like that? Have you told your husband how you feel? If you haven't you need to tell him that you need to be respected by him and if he can't do that he shouldn't be allowed in your home. "
7,ajr15c,t2_12lqsw,micrographia,"NTA, but it's not going to be helpful if you **tell him** he needs to tone it down. Instead, come from a place of support and let him know that you're concerned he's overstretching himself and you want him to be happy and healthy. "
7,b0ah2w,t2_qaaph,TooLateHindsight,"NTA She can't redefine the terms in her favor just cause she quit her job and put herself in a financially disadvantageous situation.. Also if your school loan is $5, pay it off 😛"
7,b0ah2w,t2_3d3pjchl,drbiddy,NTA She quit her job the next month? I was gonna say cut her some slack but it sounds like she was trying to trick you into paying her way.
7,9xqf4g,t2_cdq5e,Aedipus,NTA. You’re trying to give him his stuff back and he’s just being lazy bout it. I wouldn’t go through all the trouble of mailing it either.
7,9xqf4g,t2_o767g53,PremiumRecyclingBin,NTA. Box it up and put it on the road and tell him it's there for him when he can come and get it.
7,9xqf4g,t2_zmjh74j,Bangbangsmashsmash,"YTA. He has the right not to see you, he can send you money to mail it back, or you can pack it and leave it outside for him to get, or leave it at a mutual friends house. He shouldn’t have to see you to get his stuff back. "
7,b05ub0,t2_1jbeuukp,RedditAcctsInLrgAmts,"NTA, if he hasn't been on it for a reasonable amount of time then he's not on it."
7,aiu2dm,t2_2uts8p9q,Snazzy_Sausage27,"NTA If I had a friend like that, I'd want to do the same. You need to cut bad influences like her out of your life."
7,b2fyif,t2_177efw,Gr_ywind,"YTA. >""Busy airport bar"" >""it’s a table for 4"" Are you a hypochondriac? Extreme allergies? Phobias? No? Then act your age and get over yourself. You're lucky this person didn't want to make a fuss, I would've sat down and told you to stick it."
7,b2fyif,t2_3fhd1wrl,azctwfko,"NTA - I think you’re entitled to some privacy when you eat, even at an airport. Now it sure would have been nice of you to let her eat with you, but the asshole thing to do here, is keep pestering someone to share a table with you after being told ‘no’."
7,b04cn9,t2_s3vvgeq,lurkylurkeroo,">My sister started screaming at me Aaaand now she's uninvited. NTA. >she wants to pick out her own dress >""I’m going to be the maid of honor I want to stand out"" Who does she think she is? The bride? "
7,b04cn9,t2_53y95e,LucidOutwork,ESH (and YTA) Why would you tell her that when you aren't even engaged? What was your point in doing so instead of laughing it off and getting back to helping your friend out? How did you think this conversation would go? 
7,b04cn9,t2_lk6zbmj,Sun_King97,NTA. Unless she wants to pay for the wedding I don’t see why she gets to decide who’s in the bridal party and who isn’t.
7,b04cn9,t2_roksi,giganemo,NTA - And I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that your sister throwing fits and getting her way is probably not new to you...
7,a37od2,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,"YTA. You may think the bass only permeates your room, but other people can hear it. You're being rude. Get headphones, even if you have to use cheap ones. If you school has music practice rooms, go there. "
7,a37od2,t2_2nwruvk7,undergroundanchor,"YTA - stop vibrating your bloody apartment with your crappy music. I hate, with the fiery passion of a thousand suns, people who play their music loudly. "
7,a37od2,t2_7ae8i,CreamPieSatan,NTA since you’re doing it within the hours you’re perfectly allowed to do it. Offer to buy your roommate ear plugs. 
7,avrhoh,t2_2wm1glw3,Ziligando,NTA. She needs to pay her share. Talk to her about it and see if you can work it out. 
7,avrhoh,t2_vkzyd20,Min_sora,"NTA, but you really need to bring it up if you're not happy about it. The more it's happening the more she is expecting it to go that way. "
7,aut8ff,t2_zab64,craig_prime,"NTA. Wait. You've been supporting you wife for a year after she told you she wants a divorce? Why? Dude, don't pay for shit, don't give her shit, don't loan her shit. Do **you** have a lawyer? Get one! File yourself. She's a leech with no motivation to leave."
7,azmghr,t2_2lueey1a,ChampagneDoves,Waiter boi here. You’re NTA as your tip is still good but if you have any worry about disrespecting your server just leave a 20 honestly you’ll make their whole day. Unless the bill is over 100 of course then that’d make us cry 
7,azmghr,t2_2y17vd38,mvggiegrhee,"NTA, I’m a server and I’d be happy to spend a few extra minutes cleaning up for $32. You’re probably some of your server’s favorite regulars seeing as you usually leave a generous tip and clean up after yourselves. "
7,ba5ad6,t2_24zlzqj9,MistakenlyMad23,"NTA - Just because you are elderly does not give you the right to do whatever the fuck you want. He was clearly the asshole. if you had let it go, he would've gotten away with it and most likely repeated the behavior. Repercussions prevent further behavior. Good on you."
7,ba5ad6,t2_e9ya4,lisavollrath,"NTA. In my book, it's always OK to call someone on their bad behavior. The right thing for him to do was either go to the dedicated checkout lane, or ask everyone in your line if they minded."
7,a74x5y,t2_11p8rk1r,PlasticWillow,"YTA. It's completely fine that you don't want to give it to him, but don't act surprised when he doesn't want to either."
7,a74x5y,t2_ki8yn,UnpoppedColonel,"YTA for sure If your bf gives enthusiastic head that you enjoy, you better suck it up buttercup and give him the ol’ wash-O-matic every now and then. Not saying it has to be equal but if he wants it like, every now and then, you’re being a real asshole to start a Mexican standoff over it."
7,a74x5y,t2_10xyw5w,RareRino,"YTA ""Hey, I don't want to get past my feelings of disgust to give you head, but I don't care if you don't want to give *me* head, continue to give me head in the future."""

7,a90n6c,t2_1d4w0dzb,RunningTrisarahtop,"NTA. Tell them they’re welcome to change passwords if they like, but that you won’t do the iTunes password. They’ll be able to track you using snap maps or X other tracker app, and that will have to be enough."
7,a8cvvc,t2_2n4q22oj,callmelola32,NTA. You're not saying he can't invite someone over you're asking for a simple text or phone call before you get home so you can mentally prepare yourself.
7,ar2f6b,t2_54k1q,Blackstar1401,NTA. That would bug me. A bit or two when asked isn’t bad but she sounds like she is eating your entire meal. 
7,ar2f6b,t2_2dhwv9h,sqitten,"NTA She knows it upsets you, but she doesn't care enough not to do it. That's an asshole move on her part. Then trying to make you feel bad for making her feel bad for reacting to her deliberately upsetting you is a second asshole move."
7,ar2f6b,t2_14rv4z,Sqarlet,"NTA. Your plate, your food. Pushing you to a point where you don't even enjoy eating out anymore makes her an inconsiderate asshole."
7,ar2f6b,t2_2wssiz6x,aweepee,"Ugh, NTA. This sounds so annoying. Who wants to deal with this and feel like you have to police your meal? And her response is truly baffling. Like she doesn’t care at all about your feelings. I’m sorry you have to deal with this, OP."
7,ar2f6b,t2_2i9erjlr,BulimicPlatypus,"NTA. She is a fucking pig. That behaviour is annoying and extremely disrespectful. Stop going out to eat with her. If you ordered what you wanted, you have no right to eat any of what I ordered. "
7,ar2f6b,t2_1qawwscl,SushiMelanie,"NTA - I sometimes steal bites from my hubby now and then, but I’m well aware that it’s a mildly asshole-y thing to do when/if I go beyond just a taste. "
7,ar2f6b,t2_1ibdxsmb,curious_historian,NTA. Stop asking her what she wants to eat. Order whatever you want and give her a plate to eat on her own. There. Solved. And if she doesn't like it maybe she'll think why it bothers you 
7,ar2f6b,t2_33w3kg9t,_TPE_Gretchen,"NTA, mate. She's acting like a two-year old. I hope you find a good way to enforce your boundaries - pls share if so, would love to know what works! (I don't have this specific issue, but I do have people in my life who constantly push boundaries!) "
7,ar2f6b,t2_25byrgxx,bananafluffernut,"He could try oinking at her like one of the other OPs on this sub. Seriously though, NTA - I thought he meant a bite or two, but when he said she eats half of his, that’s just effing annoying and rude."
7,azxkx5,t2_gmo97y,Z7uL,NTA. You decide who you want to date. You tried to be nice but she decided to make it a tragedy. 
7,9tn5is,t2_aq8tio2,no_tread_on_snek,Nta you are important and your kids should always be your first priority. You seem to be caring for them. Keeping the house is not an issue. 
7,9tn5is,t2_6mjsm,v650,"NTA She wants the divorce, she don't work, you have the kids, she can hit the fucking road. Better get a lawyer though, because she will get pissed and take it anyway. Good luck."
7,b25ii7,t2_28ymkrw5,IGLurk,"NTA. You should honestly stop visiting him. It’s not your responsibility to counsel him, you are not a therapist. Just stop visiting him, and tell him to bitch about it to your sister instead. "
7,a9sknt,t2_11p8rk1r,PlasticWillow,Obviously YTA for trashing property that isn’t yours. It’s not the hotel’s fault but now they’ll have to deal with the repercussions. 
7,a9sknt,t2_5k43d,Debasers_Comics,"YTA. Who were these people you were partying with, the ones you ended up assaulting? As far as her cheating, she didn't cheat. Your marriage vows don't mean shit to you, they have no reason to mean shit to her. You can't complain about her getting dicked down when you have been out beefing other women. "
7,9vgco6,t2_2f3hfmov,CageyAnemone_007,"NTA but no one is here really. Both hands were full, but it's not a huge deal. Your reaction makes me think he may ask you to do things like this often."

7,a8pyze,t2_pcitxcd,Wikidess,"YTA - there's nothing wrong with meeting people online. Although I suppose I'm biased, since I'm about to marry someone I met online 8 years ago. As long as your friend is safe about it, I don't see how it's any of your business. "
7,a8pyze,t2_2dxx3hpu,julesinlrar,YTA. You sound more jealous than anything. You don’t know his story but why be so pissy he’s coming for a visit. Serious over-reaction. 
7,ap8iru,t2_2tdkyvo4,tequilathehun,"NTA I’m sorry she did that to you. Until she gets her act together and stops stealing money from her KID, it’s probably best if you limit contact. "
7,ap8iru,t2_nc103,Crapshait,NTA cut her out immediately. She should have never forged your check and cashed it for a shopping spree. I don't think it's recommened but I would confront her about it.
7,azxay6,t2_18t2cni6,jkseller,"NTA, she tested you. She knows you like games and wanted to 'test' if you liked her or games more. You showed her you aren't up for playing gmaes, grown man move"
7,ag8qzp,t2_8s2v3,baneofthebanshee,"NTA Holy hell dude, I’m really sorry that happened. If your wife knew about your past and the prank, then she’s just as much the asshole as your BIL. I don’t even know what to say. How much would it be to pay for the headset?"
7,ag8qzp,t2_no9g7,PsychicAce,"NTA. That's the price of doing pranks - sometimes shit goes wrong, and stuff breaks. Edit: Also, I am sorry your wife has so little regard for your traume - you don't deserve that."
7,ag8qzp,t2_7g6ezjl,FIVE_DARRA_NO_HARRA,Yikes. Your BIL is an irresponsible dick who shouldn't play games with property that isn't his. Your wife is an idiot. How nice of her to offer up some of your company stocks. NTA.
7,ag8qzp,t2_12iwvs,Lion12341,"NTA. Your wife is the biggest asshole. Your BIL knew the risks of such a prank, and your wife definitely knew how great that risk was. Your wife is incredibly inconsiderate."
7,ag8qzp,t2_yhjaq,FreyaR7542,"NTA. It’s his risk of taking the system home in the first place, never mind playing a traumatizing prank. What if HE dropped it? Or spilled water On it? Or it got stolen? It’s his responsibility "
7,ag8qzp,t2_foup7,Snoopfernee,"NTA. If you did that to your wife, who was a victim of sexual assualt, people would be calling for her to divorce you. I'm glad most folks are on your side."
7,ag8qzp,t2_2gzvokke,VibrantSunsets,"You’re NTA and you owe BIL nothing. Especially with your wife enthusiastically going on, all the while knowing your past. If anything your wife owes him, but not you. That’s not funny and is not your fault. "
7,ag8qzp,t2_g1k4i,tortugastation,NTA. Not in any measure are you the asshole. I just want to deeply apologize on their behalf and I hope you’re feeling better. 
7,ag8qzp,t2_r7jti,JanMichaelVincent16,"NTA. Your wife seems like a cunt, though - she knew about your history and didn’t say anything. If anyone owes money in this scenario, it’s her."
7,ag8qzp,t2_2gev0lt2,FreddysHere,NTA But to be clear... did you take a VR porno into a bathroom to jack off while your wife and in laws were in the next room? Ballsy
7,ag8qzp,t2_ef8i4p,westwestmoreland,"NTA. And for what it’s worth, the biggest asshole in this story is your wife. Without knowing anything else about your relationship, I still feel comfortable saying you should consult a divorce lawyer. "
7,ag8qzp,t2_2unls5fh,pamela271,"NTA. I don't feel like you broke it. It broke as a result of their stupid joke. Without the joke, it would not have broken."
7,ag8qzp,t2_2u9210ky,NonsensicalWizard,"NTA your wife seems like the biggest asshole because she knew prior to this “joke”, but the BIL is a pretty big asshole for not being understanding once you explained to him. Sorry to say, seems like a shitty family setup. "
7,ag8qzp,t2_9zqnk,mideon2000,"Nta, but if bil didnt know about your past then he shouldnt have to pay for it. Your wife should."

7,ag8qzp,t2_dc7867o,Brandon2221,"NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Have a conversation with your shitty BIL about how it made you feel and why he should stay away from that kind of stuff with you. I'm sure he didn't know, but even if he didn't it's still fucked he would even let you do such a thing. Stick to your guns, don't pay for shit, don't sell shit. You did nothing wrong."
7,ag8qzp,t2_r731o9g,producermaddy,NTA bc you didn’t break it on purpose but I agree you should pay for it since you broke it
7,ag8qzp,t2_132v5s,chantilly-lace,"NTA. What they did was fucked up! Their reaction is even worse. I'm a rape survivor and if my husband were to pull this I'd divorce him in a minute! The fact that your wife knew, still let it happen, and then to say you over reacted, just goes to show what kind of person she really is."
7,ag8qzp,t2_1pj1gvgz,silentpun,"NTA, of course. You cannot be an asshole for an accident. *However*, that's a really unfortunate title - I thought you were going to say you meant to break it."
7,ag8qzp,t2_302gzlhc,Ceridhwen,NTA As a rape survivor i cannot imagine what i would have done if this was done to me.
7,ag8qzp,t2_14xww8j1,Band1c0t,NTA but since you break it then you need to pay or repair eventhough it's not your fault. Still you should not put your anger to the console.

7,apc2b5,t2_1k6cm1xm,lyra_silver,"NTA Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. She shouldn't be stealing your food. You've told her multiple times and she still does it. I'd honestly bar her from the apartment."
7,apc2b5,t2_2y6iieft,lilrivers20,"NTA - while it was a asshole move, it was called for. Sometimes you have to be an asshole to people to listen. It clearly worked because she’s not coming over anymore. "
7,apc2b5,t2_9ngjw,MaoMaoDumpling,NTA - fuck that bitch. She literally giggled and think it's cute she's stealing your food? She has no sense of boundaries or decency. Your brother needs her to gtfo. 
7,apc2b5,t2_11hspx,lunari_moonari,"NTA. She was warned, continually ate all your money, and pushed you the breaking point. I'm reminded of Gail the Snail with the Miss Piggy business."
7,apc2b5,t2_dc7867o,Brandon2221,"NTA, Lol I fucking laughed so hard when you mentioned the oinking part lmao. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. She's eating her life away, practically stealing money, and doesn't give a shit. A name isn't going to do much."

7,apc2b5,t2_v6ij4gw,CrystalCoffee,"NTA. She shouldn't eat other people's food. Screw her feelings, she obviously doesn't respect yours. If it looks like a pig and eats like a pig..."

7,apc2b5,t2_1hy71qby,bachelor1602,NTA ffs she’s basically committing theft and getting pissed at you for finding a way to get back at her for it..
7,apc2b5,t2_ukqx1dh,EmilyClaire1718,"I think if you had come out of the gate with Miss Piggy you'd be an asshole . I'm a bigger lady myself, and I KNOW that would hurt my feelings. But what kind of disrespectful entitled person just goes ""teehee"" when you tell them REPEATEDLY to stop eating your food? You had a few options 1) poison your food 2) physically make her stop 3) make fun of her until she stops. Seems you went with the least offensive option. NTA"
7,apc2b5,t2_zh7is,Riden_the_high,"NTA. As a fat girl, you're not the asshole here. She has been asked many times to stop, she's ignored you. You've tried being nice, as many others have mentioned, there's time to be an asshole. This seems like one of them."
7,apc2b5,t2_2gulgsg9,milliondollhairs,"NTA, your place your rules, if she doesn’t want to abide by them then suffer the consequences. Plus, it’s not like it was something new. She knew what you were gonna call her, but kept eating y’alls food. Seems like a win here since she doesn’t want to come over anymore."
7,apc2b5,t2_rqnto,DisgruntledPOG,NTA- I'm a porker and I wouldn't eat your food especially if you told me not to. It's about being respectful and this pig needs to learn some manners.
7,apc2b5,t2_k6y0b,Burgerkillsyou,Meta: there should be another category of YTA but it’s a justifiable asshole. Like this guy is justified in his asshole actions but there’s a lot of times when people are unjustifiable assholes. 
7,apc2b5,t2_qztdd,Crilbyte,Ok hear me out. Yes YTA but it's absolutely necessary. She needs someone to be the asshole and tell her that she's a fucking rude pig. So maybe ESH but... you don't suck
7,apc2b5,t2_o7u95,OgreAllOver,"NTA. Miss piggy keeps eating ypur damn food. Tell her to find a new trough to feed from. /s Jokes aside, give your brother a bill with all the food she ate, that she wasnt suppose to."
7,apc2b5,t2_2rlv6y9o,InappropriateEnergy,Nta. You told her multiple times to knock it off. You should hide crickets and worms in your food.
7,apc2b5,t2_haytk,Kettellkorn,NTA because you’ve told her time and time again. People say it’s mean but fuck her. She’s gunna be a dick and steal your food you have a right to be a dick back.
7,apc2b5,t2_ljct0,snexjk,NTA. I would have told her something worse. What the hell is wrong with her treating your food like she owns it. Entitled and knows no boundaries.
7,apc2b5,t2_95174,metallicahomicide,NTA. Sometimes you gotta touch the stove to learn its hot. She touched the stove and this time it was on. 
7,apc2b5,t2_1nvg5n3t,ErendJames,"ESH. She shouldn't be eating your good, so she's an asshole. I was considering this as an NTA moment, until the oinking. That crossed the line in my opinion. I would have kept up with the nickname to piss her off too."
7,apc2b5,t2_12sdgr,PinkxWolf,"Nta I'd have called her a fat pos, it was immature of you but you tried the adult approach and she didn't give a shit so it's her own fault "
7,apc2b5,t2_6cdm6,WesleyPosvar,"NTA this is hilarious - I'm a firm believer in tough love. She needs to learn her lesson, and clearly talking to her calmly and telling her ""this isn't your house. this isn't your food"" wasn't working. So punishment fits the crime."
7,apc2b5,t2_12emcf,KVirello,NTA. You'd be an asshole if you did this the first few times. But her continually coming over and doing it when she's been told not to is incredibly disrespectful. 
7,apc2b5,t2_10kcehsi,kimberleye97,"NTA, not your fault that the fat arse can't stop stuffing her face. If you've told her multiple times to stop it and she doesn't, then she deserves all of the noises and names she gets. She's definitely the arsehole here."
7,apc2b5,t2_1io2s1gl,Yokie4,"NTA at all. She's an inconsiderate jerk and she deserves it. If i were you, I'd kick my brother out just to get rid of miss piggy"
7,apc2b5,t2_1fa79a,bmf09598,"NTA. She shouldn't have been eating your food. You asked her numerous times to stop doing it, so she had the choice to stop if she didn't like being called that."
7,apc2b5,t2_hm5zef8,tinytrolldancer,"NTA I'm sure it could have been handled better, but you did try. Her eating disorder is NOT your problem and you shouldn't have to handle it, especially since she's been spoken to already about what she was doing. If name calling is what it took to make her stop then it is what it is and I wouldn't feel bad about it. Sometimes people do deserve what they get. She was behaving like a spoiled brat and clearly taking what wasn't hers. Play bitch games, win bitch prizes. "
7,apc2b5,t2_u8b3z4a,Thelunarprincesss,"NTA For everyone saying ESH, he would only be an asshole if he called her miss piggy SOLELY because she is fat, but he’s not. He’s calling her that as a way to stop her from STEALING his food. She should know better and stop eating the food. "
7,apc2b5,t2_1549ex,SgtWicket1,NTA. Sounds like problem solved. If she can’t be asked civilly to do something then what else are you supposed to do?
7,apc2b5,t2_h6340,NotAnyOrdinaryPsycho,"NTA. Play bitch games, get bitch prizes. Don’t put up with that anymore. Tell your brother that if she keeps eating y’all’s food, then he’s going to have to find a new place to live. You shouldn’t have to lock up your food in your own house. I don’t know how you tolerated it so long as it is. "
7,apc2b5,t2_1axy90bi,FinerStrings,"NTA. That was fucking hilarious, maybe next time you just buy her a trough of pig slop and tell her it’s an all you can eat buffet."
7,apc2b5,t2_28l1t2h3,JustJeff236,"NTA. She won that name for herself after not listening to you. I think that it worked also, as it got her out of your house. If she comes back, tell her very seriously not to eat your food. If she keeps doing it, keep calling her names. "
7,apc2b5,t2_1x2gj2qw,BlissfulBlackBear,"NTA. She’s a thief. And your brother sucks for allowing her to steal from you and your roommate. Honestly, she should be banned from the apartment. "
7,apc2b5,t2_2401o7c1,skullz650,NTA. People don’t listen to kindness you have to be harsh for people to listen. After all she is stealing your shit. 
7,apc2b5,t2_6e5mb,KissMyGoat,"NTA, just a bit of a dick. Being a bit of a dick seems perfectly justified though"
7,apc2b5,t2_17j7r5,youridv1,"NTA. Calling somebody names referring to them being fat is completely fine with me in this situation. I could call you an asshole for ""hurting her feelings"" but she got what she deserves. I would get a second fridge with a lock on it tbh. Fuck that pig"
7,apc2b5,t2_pj7wayw,MOOCOWGOD,NTA You’ve asked nicely to stop. I would’ve done the same thing. Tell her to never come back if she going to eat your food or you’ll just keep oinking. Tell your brother the same
7,apc2b5,t2_17c778,smellslikefeetinhere,"NTA. You gave her plenty of chances, and if the only way to get her to stop devouring your food is shaming, have at it. She's a thief so this is the lesser of two evils."
7,apc2b5,t2_teaoy,amandapanda611,"NTA. She didn't learn her lesson before, so she had to learn it the hard way."
7,apc2b5,t2_wv22ewe,Dazza93,"YTA, but that was your intention after all. You called her that to hurt her so she would stop eating your food. She deserved it though. "
7,apc2b5,t2_9rai1,lPFreeIy,"NTA, your actions seemed to have the desired effect. Making a thief cry is fine by me. Hopefully she doesn't come steal more of your food"
7,apc2b5,t2_2bg3kd3d,Ydain,"YTA, but it was necessary. She's the one who escalated it to this point, therefore she had it coming."
7,apc2b5,t2_1pybh5dm,HighHillbilly,NTA she was told repeatedly to stop. When the carrot don't when you gotta use the stick! Maybe suggest she eat some carrots while she is at it. 
7,apc2b5,t2_w8mjct9,MapplethorpeGrey,NTA being an asshole to assholes does not make you an asshole
7,apc2b5,t2_2ha3va7p,super_kami_guru_93,"NTA... well, you were the asshole. But that’s what the situation called for. If you had already taken steps to stop her from eating your food, and she didn’t stop, then you have to up the game. Yes your comments were mean and directly targeted a big insecurity. But you are justified in doing this because she’s stealing your food and won’t stop."
7,apc2b5,t2_28v8vxtj,harshtruthsbiches,"NTA You have asked her nicely not to do it and yet she still does, that makes her fair game in my eyes."
7,apc2b5,t2_17rhsg30,W4r6060,NTA she has had many chances to behave respectably but choose to be a moron. She doesn't get to complain when she gets what she deserves. Disrespect people and people will disrespect you. 
7,apc2b5,t2_mmlsel1,TheOneWhosCensored,"ESH. Her and your brother are both huge assholes and are technically breaking the law. You should’ve told them you’d call the police next time she ate your food instead of the insults, which is why I can’t say NTA. I think you’re a justified asshole though, and I would’ve said much worse. "
7,apc2b5,t2_k6y0b,Burgerkillsyou,YTA but that’s not a bad thing in this scenario. Next time she does that just say “get out of my apartment you fat bitch.” This reminds me of Gail the Snail if any of you know her. Salting the snail is a horrible thing to do but it’s gotta be done. 
7,apc2b5,t2_3bdh0a6,Wickedsymphony1717,NTA I once told an ex roommate he was a fat fuck for eating my food despite telling him multiple times to stop. 
7,apc2b5,t2_4jpid,MsKim,NTA you tried several times to fix the problem politely. Looks like you finally solved the problem if she refuses to come over any more. That's a win in my book.
7,apc2b5,t2_hbczj,Rednartso,"NTA. Nobody comes between me and my food. If it's a joke and you don't actually eat it, I'll laugh it off. But if I tell you, ""stop eating my food"" and you don't? Then it's time to start totaling up receipts."
7,apc2b5,t2_2mmxv4tn,ShouldHaveBeenAnElf,YTA. I don't care how much she is annoying you. Personal digs about her weight is not on. Handle it like an adult or get your brother to handle it. If it keeps happening tell your brother he has to replace the food. Or get a lock on your cupboards. What she's doing is not on but it's not personal. You took it too far. YTA
7,apc2b5,t2_10y034,centrafrugal,"YTA but I think it's a situation where you need to be an asshole as nothing else is working. Better an asshole than a thief, in any case."
7,apc2b5,t2_bdno8,Devilsfan118,"You had to know you'd be getting the ""YTA"" or ""ESH"" stuff by the 'fat shaming' group. But she forced you to use the nuclear option - I would've probably said worse in your situation."
7,a4jen0,t2_gvrycsn,HanabinoOto,"NTA You needed to come down hard on this ""first offense"" so that she knows where you stand. Ultimately, she'll respect you more and treat you better if you hold firm."
7,b6obgn,t2_3gaxw11t,lunamunmun,"NTA You pretty much answered your own question, but why do you stay with a guy who sounds like a deadbeat?"
7,b6obgn,t2_7wy7x,skinsfan55,NTA but it sounds like you should break up. If you're scared to tell this person how much money that you have then you shouldn't be with them... 
7,b7e2vi,t2_if2glor,BKP1996,NTA. Working a job you hate is soulsucking. Take it from someone doing it now just to keep the household's head above water. Good on you!
7,avn5ug,t2_2zzny26f,heavvy_metal_cowboy,"NTA. >He doesn’t want to commit with me but keeps acting like he owns me. I've been in a relationship like this. Get out now, for your own sanity, please. "
7,avn5ug,t2_1bhlejv8,DatCenturianBoi,"NTA. You’re friends with benefits, you don’t owe him an exclusive relationship, you aren’t dating."
7,b3rseb,t2_73cl1,HycAMoment,"YTA > and the doctor said our daughter needs it. Well there you go, I doubt she'd *need* it if it was only cosmetic."
7,b3rseb,t2_em0jjbu,thither_and_yon,"YTA. Fixing a deviated septum is not cosmetic surgery, and you know she has one because the doctor said so. You're just being an asshole when you choose not to believe that your ex, your daughter, AND her doctor are telling the truth about their motivations."
7,b3rseb,t2_1cw4eqjt,Aerd_Gander,"YTA. Fixing a Deviated Septum isn't a matter of how a person looks, it can make breathing more difficult. Your child is probably suffering and you're thinking ""Oh her nose looks fine."""
7,b3rseb,t2_si2ki,Shaevar,"YTA You're the one who does not agree with the doctor. You want a second opinion, that's fine, pay for it. "
7,b3rseb,t2_ihczoee,Letsgo_321,YTA. Cut the shit and get your daughter the medical attention that would better her quality of life.
7,b3rseb,t2_13f00n,coalflare,Bro shes likely only breathing from one nostril. This can effect her breathing and make it harder to do intense stuff like running or sports. Get it fixed and dont be an ass. YTA.
7,b009zd,t2_2ue351ag,howiwantya,"NTA. From the way she’s been treating you, I’m not surprised you feel this way. I don’t know her but she sounds terrible. I’m sorry you have to go through this. "
7,a65rr1,t2_12x2fq,Rabidgoat1,"YTA, my dude you can't just let your dog off leash and expect everyone to know he's friendly"
7,a65rr1,t2_hmo3sn4,terribletyrunt,"YTA. Keep your dog on a leash. I hate people like this. Your dog is friendly. Mine are not. When your ""friendly"" dog walks up to strangers, their dogs, or any other unforeseeable thing, bad shit happens. LEASH YOUR DOGS. "
7,a65rr1,t2_ac3f7,Codadd,"I'm not worried about your dog. I'm worried about mine. If your dog gets too close because it's off leash my foot is going in its skull. I love dogs, but I'm not having mine attacked because yours isn't on a leash. YTA "
7,a65rr1,t2_866g7,fishbiscuit156,"YTA. I don’t care how behaved your dog is, it needs to be on a leash. Look at it like this, you’re not protecting people from your dog but you’re protecting your dog from people."
7,a65rr1,t2_qr3sw,Jrsplays,"YTA. The guy doesn't know your dog. Yeah, you may know your dog doesn't bite, but some random guy? He was just trying to protect his kid."
7,a65rr1,t2_9g4n,Hindu_Wardrobe,"YTA, unless you were in a designated off-leash dog park, which I don't think you were because you would have mentioned it if you were."
7,a65rr1,t2_10vu8g,Siren_of_Madness,"YTA I don't care how well behaved your dog is, the second another dog attacks him it doesn't matter HOW it started - you will not have a leg to stand on if it came down to a civil suit."
7,a65rr1,t2_30eqtza,FatassWindex,"YTA, people have their fears, and this guy, trying to protect his child, hit your dog. Always use a leash when in public, it’s common courtesy"

7,aidx3a,t2_10qp4g,Scanty_and_Kneesocks,NTA - you gave it a good try and decided it wasn't for you. Your husband is being rude and pushy. He'll ruin the ski trip not just for you but himself too if he keeps pushing you to do something you don't like.
7,a2bqkz,t2_1cudwqpz,Sandmint,"NTA, you were a kid and handling his issues was above your pay grade. It sucks, but you were taking care of yourself."
7,ayjs5i,t2_lgd9u,Slayer_Of_Anubis,"NTA I'm straightedge as you are. No drinking, no parties, etc. You're free to do it as much or as little as you want, it's nobody else's business"
7,ayjs5i,t2_b71017s,LockDown2341,NTA. A bit weird but it doesn't make you an asshole. I have a friend exactly like you. 
7,a0enhx,t2_2fc7pmk2,Vulturedoors,"NTA. You'd be an asshole if you complained or blamed someone. But get over it. Life isn't going to be like that. Real love and romance is about connection and trust, not whether a kiss makes you tingly."
7,abnedo,t2_1aj7bqjj,SinLives,NTA you dodged a bullet with this one. She is the asshole. If she comes back to you again run fast.
7,abnedo,t2_kpe7ox2,-ReckIess-,"NTA, you're showing that your care enough to check in on her. Sounds like she has quite alot for you to deal with"
7,ati7b2,t2_2137g8de,nyorifamiliarspirit,"NTA He's welcome to make whatever changes he wants to his own diet, but he can't force those changes on you and the kids. "
7,ati7b2,t2_1x2st2w,mutherofdoggos,"NTA You’re a SAHM and wife, not a short order cook. He’s a grown ass man who I assume knows where the kitchen is. You’re already feeding his FOUR children. He can eat what you make or feed himself. Is he usually this entitled or is this a one off? "
7,ati7b2,t2_2no0dwup,MizzGee,"NTA Certainly, if you want to help a bit, buy a bag of potatoes and throw one in the oven for when he gets home. Get a vegan soup recipe and throw it in the Crock-Pot so he can eat it all week. If he wants more,he can cook. "
7,ati7b2,t2_2xtrsia1,chewinghair,"NTA, he can cook too. Though if you do choose to make a few more vegan meals, hit me up and I can give you a few pointers"
7,ati7b2,t2_6wlo1,Bodymaster,"NTA. Your jusband is being selfish and unreasonable, basically expecting the whole family to go vegan for him. If he's so concerned about it let him get up a bit earlier and fix his own food."
7,ati7b2,t2_9z5p7,NakedNick_ballin,"YTA. He has to slave it at work to support your bloated family, and you can't even be bothered to spend a little more time figuring out new recipes? Lmao"
7,ati7b2,t2_6ctvy,shityeahbro,NTA Hopefully he knows that you're not lounging at home and maybe take a day off and let him manage everything you do. 
7,ati7b2,t2_rsoto,eatthebunnytoo,NTA He is being an entitled child. I’ve been the breadwinner for over half my marriage and have always done 90% of the cooking BTW. 
7,ati7b2,t2_c595b,GenevieveLeah,"NTA. I think you posted on r/parenting a while back. He is an adult, and you have a lot on your plate with your kids. You are not a short order cook. He can make his own food. "
7,ati7b2,t2_2l7qlnrn,confetticake-unicorn,YTA jfc the man slaves in a job so you can stay home. The least you and the ungrateful children can do is feed him what he wants.

7,ati7b2,t2_y343f,Fink665,NTA. Maybe you both can meal prep for him? Do his whole week in a few hours? He needs to help if he wants this to work.
7,ati7b2,t2_23xkm16p,Eragon856,"NTA. If you cook the food, as long as it doesn’t kill him cook what you want. He’s the recipient, which means he has to take what you give him. If he wants to restrict his diet, he should cook himself. Your SO sounds pretty entitled. "
7,ati7b2,t2_sekhf,rye-dread,"NTA. You’re a mother to four, not five. If he wants to go vegan, good for him, but he can’t put that on you - he should cook for himself."
7,ati7b2,t2_2hdyeogg,ATrevor810,"NTA. This is his decision he made for himself. He has no right to force his lifestyle change on you. If he really want to commit and do it, then he can prepare his own foods instead of making you make two different meals. Just because you won't make the extra food doesn't mean you don't support him. He's acting like a baby."
7,ati7b2,t2_k8tzfc,butteredhobbit,NTA Especially if he can blow up at you like that. SAHMs have a lot on their plate already without having to cook a different meal for everyone in the house.

7,ati7b2,t2_ztbew,garmdian,NTA. Sit down with him and talk it out. Explain what you've said to us. Talk it out because if you leave this pent up you will be the ass.
7,ati7b2,t2_dfu07r,MusenUse_KC21,"NTA, you are allowed to cook and eat what you like as you are making it. It's wouldn't be fair to you or your kids just to make him happy and the rest of you miserable."
7,ati7b2,t2_14em3l,snailgazer,"NTA. Your 39 year old husband sounds like a 18 year old boy. It's not your job to support his lifestyle, and if he wants to make such a difficult lifestyle choice like that then he can do it alone."
7,b18npf,t2_1lvya3g0,crinklebosslava,YTA a little for bringing it up when he was still drunk instead of waiting in the morning. Why tell a drunk you’re kicking him out to leave in the morning instead of waiting in the morning to tell him?

7,aahkj8,t2_lie8hqg,IggyBall,"NTA. Wtf at that flight attendant? Totally unnecessary comment. I generally will let little kids go first but it’s not required to do and, had I been in your situation, I wouldn’t have let the kid go first."
7,aahkj8,t2_263tuch3,CoupleofLugnuts,"NTA. But if you weren't on your period or other reasons like food poisoning, would you have let the kid cut?"
7,aahkj8,t2_2jyir0jv,SidHoffman,"NTA. In that scenario, if it's an emergency, it's the Dad's responsibility to say so. You don't have to assume an emergency just because a kid was being impolite."
7,aahkj8,t2_143pgt,Diocleatian,"NTA, there is a line for a reason, and if you have to go, you have to go. Especially if you have a situation. The FA was an asshole."

7,aahkj8,t2_18rcmbfn,fifidelia,"NTA. maybe if the dad said the kid was about pee himself and could you please go first then we might have a different discussion.. but again, YOU had an emergency too. I would take leakage over a kid peeing in front of me tho! But that didn’t happen. Dad was acting rude and entitled. You aren’t a jerk. "
7,aahkj8,t2_tv4ndxp,yerroslawsum,"NTA, I'd be the asshole and be a pain in the ass to the flight attendant. In that very lavatory, probably."
7,aahkj8,t2_48br9,Jessie_James,"NTA As a parent, I know my kids have to pee and don't plan ahead, so we make them pee before we get in cars, on planes, go shopping, etc. Dad screwed up. Not your fault. That flight attendant was a complete fucking asshole. Your reply was awesome."
7,aahkj8,t2_ep65s,Skigazzi,NTA. If it was an EMERGENCY then the Dad should've or would've spoken up. That dad is a borderline A for letting his kid run free on a thin aluminum tube in the sky. 
7,aahkj8,t2_13j73z,Carliebeans,"NTA. You waited in line for your turn. The flight attendant was a major asshole - he doesn’t know of your bathroom situation, nor does he have the right to. "

7,b5u7l6,t2_2c62kzab,NeekaNou,NTA It’s not like she didn’t know as you invited her. I’m sure if she had said something at the time you would have looked at different dates. She’s the asshole for thinking the world revolves around her.

You don't care about integrity. You'd better be careful if you are also in college. Her school might contact yours or she might contact them in retaliation, since you are just as guilty as she is. You very well may face consequences, as well. "

When you thought his friends were picking on you, was that after he'd told them about your OCD, but before he told you he'd told them?

7,amih70,t2_1rf6aswj,bcombest1,NTA. She shouldn’t talk shit about her boss especially to customers. That messes up the business and makes the customer not want to come back.

This is one of those situations, where I think the anger is misplaced. He knows what's going on and hasn't make any effort to change it. He also clearly doesn't want to fire her, but is pretending he might want to. This is a husband-wife issue, not a wife-husband's secretary issue. I'd want to find out WHY he wants the gatekeeper."

7,b7t4ag,t2_jybgb54,JarWeb,YTA Criticizing him for enjoying another culture that he has been enriched in since childhood is so incredibly cruel. If he knows what's good for him he'll leave you and find someone that actually cares about him.

7,b7t4ag,t2_3i9urxvl,Cmckenn20,YTA. Adopted families are real families and this is a part of his cultural experience. He didn't decide that he like Italian culture and choose to arbitrarily adopt it because he thought it was cool. This is a part of who he is. 
7,b7t4ag,t2_10kzanl4,TombBroom,"YTA - he *is* Italian. Being part of a culture has nothing to do with blood. He was raised Italian so he is Italian. I have Italian and Macedonian blood, but I don’t call myself Italian beause I was raised under Macedonian traditions and Macedonian culture. It’s the same thing as your bf, blood does not determine it. "
7,b7t4ag,t2_2un4vas3,sneetsnart420,"YTA as he was raised Italian, it's not appropriation if you were raised that way. Plus Italy was never colonized so your claim of appropriation is double BS."
7,b7t4ag,t2_3i5b82vy,TasteTheGraveyard,"YTA. You can't appropriate a culture you were raised in, no matter what your heritage is. Give him some slack and just let the issue go "
7,b7t4ag,t2_hxhcvkp,Jabronskyi,"Yes. YTA. No. 1 Who do you think you are? Just because they don't share the same blood, doesn't mean they're not family. No. 2 I'm originally from Ghana, but I was born Italy and, as an Italian, I'm personally offended. "
7,b7t4ag,t2_r6f31,Shizou_H1,YTA Do you realise that you are an OG racist by claiming he cant be italian without the blood of italian inside him. Pls tell me you dont call yourself a proud American then. Jesus.
7,b7t4ag,t2_9nwgg,poojokesarefunny,"YTA. He's Italian. You can't just tell someone they're not who they where raised to be. If you have an issue with what sounds like a cornerstone of his identity, maybe you should rethink your relationship. "
7,b7t4ag,t2_vlrj3c3,Witheer,"YTA, he grew up like that just because he doesn’t have Italian blood doesn’t mean he was raised like an Italian. "

7,b7t4ag,t2_2yxhusts,Devourer_of_felines,"YTA. The guy was raised in a family that taught him Italian culture. How is it ""appropriating their culture"" when it's literally the one he was raised in? > it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. Were you teleported here from the 18th century? ""He doesn't have a drop of ____ blood in him!"""
7,b7t4ag,t2_aoved3,JoeDoufu,"YTA. He identifies as an Italian, he has an Italian family, he was raised Italian, he speaks Italian, he cooks great Italian food. Why are you bitching about his ""impure"" blood? Tom Hagen was German-Irish, and he still was consigliere to the Don. Culture and Blood are two entirely different things. Of course, Nazis disagree with that, but fuck 'em, right?"
7,b7t4ag,t2_apaa631,Vini-B,"YTA, wtf?? Hie mother was adopted and raised in X-culture. He got that culture from his grandparents, and yes, they ARE his fucking grandparents and family no matter you believe.

7,ahpwgp,t2_ef8i4p,westwestmoreland,"YTA. A Complete asshole. Why on earth would younger sons bust their ass to enrich an older brother. You’re an asshole. Your father was an asshole. And you are taking advantage of your younger siblings. You are asking your older son to take advantage of his siblings. Actually, maybe not an asshole. Maybe a complete and utter cunt. "
7,ahpwgp,t2_18jiv7wq,mshirley99,"YTA. My fondest hope is that neither of your sons wants your business, but your daughter does. You seem to want to control your children to the exclusion of who they are. You don't get to determine their roles in the world and say you love them. You only love who you want them to be. You're not just an asshole: you're a controlling asshole. Maybe you'll grow up. For your kids' sake, I hope so."

7,ahpwgp,t2_2swdl30q,destroyergsp123,"YTA. I have no issue with you passing it on to your oldest if that is what he really wants, but you can't make the assumption your oldest will even want it when he is older. Don't force any of your children into a career path that you chose."

7,b43t53,t2_whrl9,RozzERzZ,"NTA but it sounds like your GF is. Also, if some part of you is relieved that she wants to break up, you should probably listen to that part of you and work out if you don't actually want to be with her"
7,b43t53,t2_236v5tfv,Shawn411,It's your money and you have the right to do whatever you want with it. NTA
7,b43t53,t2_3gcsb0yy,Sillyrabbittttt,"Definitely NTA. That is your money, so unless you were married to your current girlfriend, she really has no say in what you do with the money, legally. Especially since you’re going to be helping your kids by helping their mom. "
7,b43t53,t2_6yuaf,Viperbunny,"NTA. It is your money! You can do with it as you please. Your ex is still the mother of your kids. You want them to have a good life. It makes sense to do this. Your gf sounds petty and jealous. She may just feel insecure, but sne needs to work through that. You are providing for your family, as well you should. If your girlfriend doesn't like it then she can walk away."
7,b43t53,t2_2o8413wz,misstiff1971,"NTA, You are strongly taking care of your children and trying to make up for hurting her. Your GF is a bitch."

7,b43t53,t2_a1dp5,Brewtown,"NTA. You're being a good father and a better ex husband. I'll be honest, if your GF can't understand that you are bringing financial stability to the woman who gave birth to your children, it seems like the only asshole here is her. "
7,b43t53,t2_zkfas,googledmyusername,"NTA Follow your heart. You are a good guy. Hopefully the gf will come to realize this. If she doesn't, it's her loss. "
7,b43t53,t2_3wva2rq,KPer123,NTA . My ex who is the mother of my kids is a bitch. I hate her guts .... she’s good with my kids though .... i would do the same thing.
7,b43t53,t2_2em21wjf,Birbman3,NTA. But you would be an asshole if you didn't do something fun and exciting with you money and tell reddit all about it. We want to live vicariously through you. 
7,b43t53,t2_ric4q,chartito,"NTA. Even if you didn't freely give money to your ex, she is well within her rights to take you back to court for more child support. You are doing the right thing here. Keep the courts out of your co-parenting relationship as much as possible."
7,b43t53,t2_27ea4lh0,Nazism_Was_Socialism,NTA. You should never apologize for trying to provide a better life for your children. You fucked up by telling your gf you won the lottery though 
7,b43t53,t2_zsgpoe1,Vaninea,"NTA. You won the money, your girlfriend has zero claim to any of it, and you should be taking good care of your kids. BTW, if you do marry your girlfriend, her behavior here SCREAMS pre-nup. Then again, it screams that you probably shouldn't ever entertain marrying her."
7,b43t53,t2_12gmqj,Dogzillas_Mom,"NTA and let the trash take herself out. If she loves you, she'd would support you being kind to your ex and also, setting up your kids for life. She just wants a chunk of the cut, IMO."
7,b43t53,t2_10z05h,Nawwwm,"NTA you're doing the right thing. And as for your current gf, you better put her in check. The second she threatened to break up with you, you should have said ""I'll help you pack"". It sounds like she has the mentality of a high school girl. Find yourself a woman, or train this one. And don't fuck it up next time ;)"
7,b43t53,t2_306jl14b,lostsoul7891,"NTA you might be a saint, sounds like you really understand how adulting works and how your supposed to treat others. Your GF needs to get over it and if she leaves you, great dodged a real bullet, you don't need that. "

7,b43t53,t2_pih8a,Cloudinterpreter,"NTA, and if you're relieved that she will break up with you, maybe take that as a sign that you really dont want to be with her. "
7,b43t53,t2_1q6n47no,SadPamda,"NTA. The real and only asshole here is your girlfriend, who did know about your wife when you were still married. So her reasoning is complete bullshit. What kind of woman has the audacity to be angry over the fact that you want your wife who is raising your children to have a better life? "
7,b43t53,t2_1oosvw5x,DuchessOfGeek,"NTA Your girlfriend is the asshole. I suspect you already know this because it's been 6 years since you divorced your wife and she is STILL your girlfriend. Bye Felicia. Thank you, next."
7,b43t53,t2_13ht8v,Kiddabidda,"NTA... seems like your girlfriend is though... money brings out the worst in people alot of times. Or maybe their true self?

7,b43t53,t2_zmdbu,readit_later,"NTA. However, your GF is. Forget about her. Do what you want. If she wants to come along for the ride then so be it, but I wouldn't put up with her shit. Don't get hooked on drugs and try to live a simple life; for your kids and their mother."
7,b43t53,t2_3e7xctgx,egadswut,"NTA It’s your money and you can do what you want with it. You’re doing a good thing by your kids with it and that’s great. Also, if you decide to marry the current gf, get a prenup. "

7,b43t53,t2_tvpc7,oldcreaker,"NTA: There should be a designation of being the opposite of the asshole. You're giving someone you care about - and your kids - a better life. *My gf is threatening to break up with me* At this point, if she stays, will it be for you? Or the money?"

7,b43t53,t2_e9yjt,thestreetiliveon,"NTA. I have my ex-husband in my will and he’s a bit of a dick. If I won money, of course I would help him out. Your good character is shining through and you’re setting a good example for your kids. Well done."
7,b43t53,t2_1ei758kf,Ill_Consequence,NTA What your doing is a beautiful thing. You are not disrespecting your girlfriend at all. Your ex is the mother of your children and it sounds like she too is a great person. 
7,b43t53,t2_10z9kf,HammeredHeretic,"NTA Your gf is the kind of person that you cheated on someone with, and now you're surprised she's a selfish garbage bag of a human? Come on. "
7,b43t53,t2_i1m38,izzgo,"If YTA, it's because you're still with your gf while being in love with your ex. "
7,b43t53,t2_d5kk9,recapdrake,"NTA, the fact you're feeling relieved about her threats of a breakup is maybe a sign you secretly feel like letting her."
7,b43t53,t2_a9lb34p,boo3114,"NTA! Let the GF go. You're trying to improve someone's life, that's an awesome thing. Gf seems insecure and maybe a little greedy. Besides you said it yourself, you have 'f you' money. "
7,b43t53,t2_j70lv,kronaz,"NTA, it's your money, and NOBODY has a right to tell you what to do with it. Except Uncle Sam, I guess, because that asshole demands a cut, even though he did nothing to earn it... but hey."

7,b43t53,t2_6pqxd,heybebo22,NTA- you’re gf is jealous and has probably always been jealous of her. Some jealousy is normal but if she can’t get past that to understand that this money will be helping your ex AND your kids then you don’t need her. She’s being selfish.

Maybe (if you ditch the gf) you can take the ex, kids, and your parents on a trip to Alaska or something!"
7,b43t53,t2_2fw6gcxg,norudemouthnoises,NTA. The GF is. Your ex is your kids' mum for crying out loud. My BF still has his ex in his will and life insurance policies and I sure as heck don't begrudge him for this. But you knew that already. That feeling of relief you get when your GF threatens to leave is telling you so.
7,b43t53,t2_1mm2nts1,Roastednutz420,"NTA. It's not like you're giving JUST your ex wife the money. You have two kids together. That's a WHOLE different ball game. Your girlfriend is the asshole, and if the threats of her loving make you feel relieved then you should leave her. "
7,b43t53,t2_byasw,nationalhistory1889,Completely NTA. You are trying to do something good that is independent of your gf. This has nothing to do with her and she quite frankly shouldn’t have an opinion on it.
7,b43t53,t2_cincr,iBeFloe,NTA So let her. She’s not getting anything if she breaks up with you *anyways*. Let her be angry for not understanding you had a life before her.

7,b43t53,t2_xocni,Jyllidan,"NTA. You are doing this to help your children and to help someone you wronged. Your girlfriend already stands to gain a lot here, and quite frankly, it isn't her money. It's yours. If you were doing it to try to win back your ex-wife or to screw over your gf, then you'd be the asshole. But doing it to help your kids and their mother who was good to you? Absolutely not."
7,b43t53,t2_1q7qyvpy,itscloudy214,"NTA - you’re a good dude. I hope more people are like you in the world. You give me hope for humanity....your girlfriend on the other hand, does not. Congrats on the win! "
7,b43t53,t2_27vb7m5a,Minkiemink,NTA Your GF is the asshole. What a horrible woman. If she breaks up with you? YAY. If she doesn't break up with you? Leave her. You're doing the right thing for your children and for the mother of your children. Bravo. 
7,b43t53,t2_2xtq5yar,henry0937,"NTA- you are so not the asshole. Thier is one, but you are not it."
7,b43t53,t2_3dyfgvsv,moonlight234,YTA and I would break up with you too and you don’t seem like you care that your girlfriend will leave you. So here’s hoping she does leave you. 
7,b43t53,t2_hxbpe,louloutre75,"NTA for doing what you wish with your money, helping the kids, and helping a decent human being who's working hard. YTA for telling her even *before* telling your gf. That gf is supposed to be your partner. I don't think you treat her as such."
7,b43t53,t2_2iqh4yro,taschana,"NTA. Greedy, disrespctful bitch. She doesnt have a great character: First she goes after a married man, now this? She probably asks you for half of it, so she can dump you and get her golddigger badge."
7,b43t53,t2_98li6,Mabuisakura,"NTA - a) you have made it out to seem like she is barely your girlfriend. b) it's your money. If you had a better relationship then you might be TA. Hell me and my SO aren't married but we have been playing it for a while. We would talk about it. But nah, go do you! "
7,b43t53,t2_1b39i9xd,bobs_big_bob,NTA - give your money to whoever you want and the mother of your children would be the first person most people would give it too! 
7,b43t53,t2_2f8krmr6,gottabkind,"NTA. This is actually very selfless and I think you’re a good parent and friend. If your current gf doesn’t understand why you’d want your kids and their mother taken care of, she’s TA. "
7,b43t53,t2_h5i67,spritanium,"YTA. You cheated on your wife and you still love her, but not enough to stop dating your side chick?"
7,b43t53,t2_8kyo4,Miasmata,"YTA, you're clearly just making up reasons to justify your desperation to make it up to your ex. If you're gonna be in a relationship for 6 years with a new woman, you need yo move on. What you're doing now is toying with your girlfriend's feelings. "
7,b43t53,t2_14hzx8,sbxd,"YTA - you can't have all the women dude, like yeah give your kids a nice life, but saying you love her just says it all. Your girlfriend deserves better IMO. "
7,aqy4bn,t2_yj4o8,PM_TITS_OR_DONT,"NTA, your stepdad was being a jerk. You're 15, he shouldn't be in the room during your physicals at all anymore. "
7,aqy4bn,t2_z0qpm,darkdollmaker,"NTA and his refusal to leave is really creepy, controlling behavior. He may not realize it though, but you should talk to your mother about it."
7,aqy4bn,t2_r8j97,MonsterHipster,"Nta, but my go to move in this situation lock eyes pull my dick out and start waving it around"
7,aqy4bn,t2_1q3rrsgh,pinkbeansprout,NTA. Too bad the doctor wasn't there to back you up. I always leave the exam room when my son or the doctor ask me to.
7,aqy4bn,t2_1jvlizv6,RunThroughTheWoods,"NTA. This is sooo fucked up. You asked him to leave while you got changed and he insisted on staying, that's so weird, why was it so difficult for him to just step outside??? This seems super sketchy to me honestly"
7,b5jdwq,t2_1628qf01,OrangeSockMonkey,"YTA. Dear people of Reddit, if your partner says they don't want children or anymore children, respect that! Don't fucking pester them, give ultimatums, or threaten them into giving you a child. Either deal with it or break up and move on. There is no way you're not the asshole is this situation, you knew she didn't want anymore kids and you kept going with the relationship."
7,b5jdwq,t2_2joa71cy,SmallChallenge,YTA. Yet another stupid post where a man thinks he's entitled to a kid. You're literally placing more value over some imaginary non existent fetus over your very real girlfriend. She's not your personal incubator.
7,b5jdwq,t2_22xk3d,OKSnowball,YTA. She's been upfront with you about not wanting any more kids and probably didn't appreciate you trying to change her mind. Don't get upset because she called your bluff.
7,b5jdwq,t2_2jhkj57z,lizzitron,YTA 100%. Find another baby incubator. You certainly don’t want a woman with her own views that you’d need to respect. 
7,b5jdwq,t2_29heo3zo,gayplantdad,"YTA. You don’t want a girlfriend. You want a baby machine. Pregnancy is really fucking difficult, and she maybe had an extra awful pregnancy. She doesn’t want to put her life on hold like that again. Good for her for leaving."
7,b9dxwa,t2_10xh1q,DClawdude,I was originally gonna say you were the asshole or everyone sucks but nah NTA. She's abusing her daughter both physically and financially. She's probably setting her daughter up to be anorexic for years if not life. 
7,b9dxwa,t2_3evreupg,Nicolette_V,"NTA. That woman is abusing her daughter plain and simple. I wouldn't think you were the asshole if you drove over that woman with a truck. I'm 4'11"" and 100lbs. My minimum safe weight is 92 lb. that girl is almost a foot taller than me and definitely should not be my weight."
7,b9dxwa,t2_3g365d6b,101mimo101,What the shit? I’m 5’8” and weigh 135 and I’m a UK size 8 (US size 4).. I have no idea how this girl is walking around that skinny and no one is giving her a sandwich and telling her mom to fuck off NTA
7,b9dxwa,t2_2wd4gagj,BellaBlue06,NTA that woman is abusing her child and seems like a real sociopath. My heart breaks for her daughter. She absolutely needs help and away from this woman. How fucking awful. Does she steal her daughters food too? :/
7,b9dxwa,t2_13j73z,Carliebeans,NTA and Annie is not a nice person. She’s going the right way to have her poor daughter end up with an eating disorder which could be a lifelong battle. It’s horrible what Annie has done to her.
7,b9dxwa,t2_a06do,SongRiverFlow,"NTA - It sounds like Annie has an eating disorder and is projecting onto her daughter. This is very common. Not sure if there is anything you can do other than to contact CPS again. But I would keep doing it, if you can. "
7,b9dxwa,t2_2xffqing,strawberrypockystix,"NTA. I’m so concerned for her daughter. She is severely underweight, and I can’t believe CPS hasn’t done anything about it."
7,b9dxwa,t2_17iz9o,detronlove,"NTA. She’s being abusive to her daughter, and it’s hard to sit and watch that without snapping at some point. "
7,b9dxwa,t2_drmmd,kmatts,"NTA. I think you should have gone a step further and called her out for stealing her daughter's college money. Seriously, is there anyone you can report that to?"
7,b9dxwa,t2_13o8lyd5,ethanjscott,"YTA, for not persuing a child abuser, you are aware that what she was doing is child abuse right? and your not calling them an asshole everytime you see them?"
7,akifn8,t2_1g6sbyvg,weirdlyconjured,"NTA, but watch out for your emotional vulnerable young friend who’s in a new relationship with a real dick. It’s not going to go well."
7,ag9jwg,t2_j8ttu,Apercent,"YTA. But unpopular opinion, if she's already proven to contacting internet predators, you should cut off her internet. Not unhinge her door. Cut off the internet. Because that's the real problem. Unhinging her door isn't going to help you, it's just going to make her feel prisoner. "
7,ag9jwg,t2_af013,wingnutkj,"YTA - how is taking her door off the hinges going to smarten her up? It's only going to make her smarter at not getting caught, more likely to resent you, and more likely to do something stupid."
7,ag9jwg,t2_cw6ry,ZestfulClown,"YTA - It’s not going to fix anytime and it’s going to breed resentment. Did you actually call your 15 year old daughter stupid? Are you kidding me? Calling something she does or says stupid is one thing, but you’re a fucking mean person if you’re calling your daughter stupid to her face. Take a look at your parenting practices."
7,ag9jwg,t2_1cq9v8hh,SeraphofFlame,"YTA. And hey, are these actually proven to be internet predators? Or are they just people she meets online and you're an overprotective ""parent"""
7,ag9jwg,t2_12hm6j,Doomstar32,"After reading through the comments and your replies. YTA and not only in this situation, you are just an asshole. People are giving well thought out answers and you can't accept that you are the problem here. Grow the fuck up and be a better dad."
7,ag9jwg,t2_12iwvs,Lion12341,"YTA. I'd agree with you if she still had her phone and other electronics, but she only has a few old game consoles, so she can't really get herself into much trouble. She's entitled to a bit of privacy."
7,ag9jwg,t2_sevxz,koukla1994,"YTA - You claim her autism is fake and called her stupid. You’re a nasty, awful person. Every friend I have who was abused had an asshole dad who took the door off the hinges. What is it with abusive parents and their need to remove privacy and security?! "
7,ag9jwg,t2_13lujt,ladymedallion,"YTA, especially after reading your comments. You actually seem like a fucking awful parent. I hope she completely stops talking to you the day she turns 18. I could say plenty more, but most of these comments get the point across quite clearly. "
7,9xaxrw,t2_owz3mu7,Janaelle5,"You're NTA, but it's a shitty thing. IMO, you should have dropped him off at one of the shelters or the vet. Both places can be reasonably assumed to take the dog and not let it wander about in the cold."
7,arywys,t2_125x3u,Aithana0416,NTA - he has a problem and his friends are Assholes next time leave him with them to take care of him for all the fun they had! 
7,arywys,t2_38me24el,Rusted_Meathook,NTA tell him you've started drinking and you woke up in some strange place and see how he feels about it.
7,a7d121,t2_5w4xb,GuyNoirPI,"YTA It's hard to tell exactly what happened because of the write up, but it sounds like it's your fault for not giving him the coupon. "
7,a7d121,t2_477coj8,simiwood,Yta they told you to take the coupon to the store your just a whiney entitled asshole who thinks the rules don't apply to them.
7,amxmxg,t2_q373g,NoctiferPrime,"NTA. It's super shitty to trick people like that. Even if it was meant to be a joke, it's a mean spirited one. "
7,ab0348,t2_17ex0c,glboisvert,"YTA. The kid was out of bounds, but that wasn't the way to go about it. Talk to the kid's parents, or if they won't do anything to the flight attendant."
7,a57inj,t2_2icjq5th,Ciderxi,"This sounds like a shitpost,or legitimate child abuse. Do yourself a favor and call CPS. It doesn't matter if she's your mother. She's a piece of crap. Good luck OP. You also sound like you're not exactly in a sound mental state,I would recommend seeking help from a school counselor as well"
7,ac9a2p,t2_aifc1,jordan087,"NTA I can’t even comprehend why you think you could possibly be the asshole in this situation. By thinking that alone, you were already being too nice to that entitled woman. "
7,b4tm8u,t2_2fetmmc,donkeynique,"YTA, what the fuck. If you can't sit down and share your sexual health status with your boyfriend, you're way too immature to be having sex. People like you are exactly why STDs spread so far."
7,b4tm8u,t2_2n9d99mi,WinterGlory,"YTA, never hide any kind of STDS, even if there are very little risks. If he doesnt know and gets it, its YOUR fault. If he knows you have herpes and still have sex with you then its HIS choice. The difference on your conscience is massive and you should never hide the truth from someone, especially when it comes to health"
7,b4tm8u,t2_250ajnd1,ferramenta11,"YTA. Yes, tell him and explain it just as you did here. I told my boyfriend I have HPV but it’s not the kind that causes genital warts and there are no symptoms. "
7,b4tm8u,t2_xokya,SMDNOED,"YTA and you may be committing a crime. You are a gigantic, massive asshole for removing his agency and ability to consent."
7,aokahd,t2_bdz8xrt,poopshoes53,"NTA. You don't have to like anyone. You're allowed to have your own opinions. She asked you straight out (after a DAY?) and you answered. Then she threw a tantrum. God, I promise college will be better."
7,aokahd,t2_2ib590kw,AVerySnaileySnail,"NTA wow is that some hardcore manipulation she's pulling, and if anything she's bullying you for spreading lies and turning your friends against you"
7,aokahd,t2_gbcsp,caggybandicoot,"NTA. She asked, you were honest and as far as we’re aware, you weren’t an ass about it. It’s not your fault that she doesn’t like the answer."
7,an2oly,t2_846xn,Cauchemar89,**YTA** Considering you already call him an idiot for no real reason and giving him false information only because he annoyed you. 
7,age8pg,t2_rmzlxp3,StragglingShadow,"NTA. Honestly though youre probably better off just grabbing hands. You dont have to pray or bow your head, but just joining hands will at least get her off your back."
7,acem4z,t2_1qbgxh4c,Palerthanghosts,INFO. Does this happen often? Is your work super duper busy? If so then NTA and she should be more considerate of your time. If this is the first time she has done this then YTA; you could've told her nicely that you can't do it right now.
7,asuqqz,t2_2x697f4q,anthrocenekid,NTA you can’t stay in a toxic relationship just to support a toxic person at the cost of your own mental health
7,asuqqz,t2_g7knv1f,jolie178923-15423435,NTA Of course *he's* going to think you're an asshole because it makes him look like the good guy. Don't worry about it.
7,afdhjq,t2_1jbpipg3,schwenomorph,"NTA. Your comment to your brother was justified, as was the anger. The vase was an accident. You'd be an asshole if you broke it on purpose. "
7,axacqk,t2_26hzbxtx,Prepure_Kaede,YTA You can miss one raid night to meet your gf's mother. Are you among the top guilds or something? Otherwise one night really shouldn't be a big deal
7,axacqk,t2_mi8cbqp,crystalinguini,"Dude YTA because her mom only visits twice a year. You can skip your raid for one day. Also, your title is misleading, your girlfriend didn't insult your hobby or say you couldn't do it anymore. You're not standing up for your hobby as a whole, you're just standing up for the 3-4 hour raid you don't want to miss on Tuesday."
7,b1r8b0,t2_1009l8,Somali_Imhotep,NTA you’re friend allowed a stranger to be a narcissist and insult you all night and then gets shocked when both her and the douche get lip back? You deserve a better friend OP
7,b5lqzc,t2_2k4tl74y,queenb_99,"NTA- I'm all about respecting your elders, but if she doesn't respect that you pay for the driveway then fuck her. "

7,a1rg3q,t2_2nxvs661,AnAngryBlueberry,"NTA. Fuck those kids, and fuck their parents for raising that kind of brats and not having their spawns under control."
7,a1rg3q,t2_tu1hmlq,Avrelo,"NTA, because you did help someone’s dog, though not the best method. I’d tell them that it is a crime to abuse animals, and the cops could put them in jail. or get parents involved."
7,a1rg3q,t2_29xkfelv,OllyPolly28,"NTA. If you had broken it just because the kids were annoying you, etc., you’d definitely be TA. But that wasn’t the case. You were calm the first time, and told them they needed to stop. They did it again, poof! No more gun. These kids were the assholes for abusing a defenseless animal! You stopped animal abuse, so definitely NTA. I agree with what someone else said though; definitely record it if it happens again!"
7,a1rg3q,t2_1hh8nrcx,ThatIsATastyBurger12,"NTA, fuck those kids. Unfortunately there is no cure for being a cunt, but at least that poor dog wasn't getting shot at anymore."
7,a1rg3q,t2_b465d,Arvidex,"YTA They are also asswholes, but they are kids! Tell their parents to deal with it, or the owner of the dog if the parents don't do anything."
7,a1rg3q,t2_9eti3,KatFrog,NTA and I strongly suggest that you find the kids' parents and let them know what their Little Precious Johnnie is doing. I also suggest that you record them shooting the dog if you catch them doing it again. 
7,a1rg3q,t2_emwucn,Cinnamon_Razzmatazz,NTA. I love the image this put in my head. Dumb kid asks what you're going to do about it and you smash his gun against a wall. That's what I'm gonna do you little shit! LOL Too good. &#x200B;
7,a1rg3q,t2_p2x1qs4,InsanityBrickBoi,NTA. You did the right thing by not hurting them but by completely stopping them from shooting at that point. Glad you'll contact the parents if you see the little fuckwits again. Nice job though
7,a1rg3q,t2_2c6vgzo4,no_re-entry,NTA you gave those kids a chance and they messed up. They've got to learn consequences come with their actions.
7,a1rg3q,t2_gml8s,theshadowmoses,NTA I would of done the exact same thing if I had to witnessed it
7,a1rg3q,t2_e9f47,AceofToons,"NTA for breaking it But the asshole for not taking it with you, they shouldn't have been left with it"
7,ap3mh8,t2_t41p2,IFeelRomantic,NTA. Even in relationships you have the right to privacy; if there's private stuff on your phone he has no right to pressure you into giving your phone to him.
7,agme1n,t2_zmjh74j,Bangbangsmashsmash,"NTA! I can not believe the waitress would add the charge to your bill without your consent! It is not her business at all. Yes, you should have offered to buy a new one, but you didn’t, and can not be forced to pay. It’s not your waitress’ job to evaluate your moral responsibility."
7,api0aj,t2_j0hme,feliscat,"NTA If they told you they would call you last night, and did not, then they can't expect you to be ready to work at 10. Fuck them."
7,b8ew44,t2_5vltm98,fudgigulizle,"YTA - and I’m a chick. It’s his house, his rules. You don’t get to tell him what he can and cannot do in his own home. That doesn’t mean that it isn’t icky, because it is, but just for trying to control him, you’re the asshole in this situation. If you guys had discussed this beforehand and he agreed that he wouldn’t have any guests over, then he would be the asshole. But you didn’t, so he did, and you reacted poorly."
7,b8ew44,t2_2xjzy5,Otherwise_Window,"YTA. Grow up. He's an adult. *You're* an adult, in theory. It's a separate room. If you don't want your brother to live his own life in his own home while you are present? Pay for a hotel."
7,b8ew44,t2_1bch06a7,Hundred_Acres,"YTA - that's pretty immature, you shouldnt worry about what your brother is doing while you are at his apartment. That's pretty rude dude."
