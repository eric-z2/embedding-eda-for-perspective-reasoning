0,a73l8g,t2_o8utf,PreOpTransCentaur,"NTA for whatever, having feelings I guess, but kind of the asshole for struggling with money consistently and still trying to procreate. Also, adoption is *extremely* fucking pricy. You'd be getting off light with a 5k IVF treatment. Trust me."
0,aeaw4t,t2_1bq7n5z8,s10ppypanda,"NTA. This is silly. “American” is the commonly-accepted demonym for people from the U.S. across many languages. Also, just because they could technically call themselves American as well (using a broader definition) doesn’t make you NOT an American, so they shouldn’t have any problem with you using the term. "
0,aeaw4t,t2_ftm8gi6,SomeDumbGamer,"NTA, the only reason we call ourselves Americans is because their is literally no good alternative. United-Statesian doesn’t exactly have the same ring to it."
0,aeaw4t,t2_1szgnkow,NonnoBobKelso,"NTA They are American as well or they are from the Continents of America, but when they suggest you don't call yourself American, do they give an alternate, or are you just not allowed one, which would be ridiculous."
0,aeaw4t,t2_10eud3,DragonTigerBoss,I've heard that South Americans do this because their schools teach the Americas as a single continent. NTA regardless. They're being jingoistic nematodes for challenging a stranger's national identity.
0,aeaw4t,t2_10to0e,MildredNatwick,"NTA, they're making a silly argument that ignores the way language works, esp. since there's no subsitute in the English language that you could alternately use to describe your nationality. What, are you supposed to say, ""I'm a United States of American""? "
0,aeaw4t,t2_4at5t,Lucavious,YTA for squabbling over the merits of a seemingly arbitrary designation in this situation. Just tell 'em they're not fat enough to be real Americans and diffuse the situation. No need to make it a big deal.
0,aka65b,t2_fjn38jd,looCsIyerT,"YTA, for reasons you clearly stated >So am I an asshole for being a stuck up teenage girls who yells at her dad for trying to make ends meet? side note: literally none of the people you've described are worth talking to, much less an argument with a parent."
0,aka65b,t2_2bswm839,Skullbearer55,"YTA, but as a teenager that's excusable. Teenagers will pick on each other for any reason. My parents had good jobs, I have good clothes and tech, and I was still teased because I ate sandwiches. It's not a cause, it's an excuse. "
0,a4hfkv,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,"NTA. I think you're just a typical teenager who's not 100% in to family traditions anymore. That's pretty normal. Your mom sounds a bit nutty. She should do things because she wants to, not to get anyone's appreciation, recognition, etc. "
0,a4hfkv,t2_2et7shtd,AMJ_CSP,NTA. But this is obviously a big deal for your mom. if you get along with her in other ways and aren’t busy - why not help her decorate?? If your relation is strained already - then I can see not wanting to help her. 
0,9w539i,t2_y5tlr,SlicedNugget,"NTA. Nothing wrong with listening to novels like that, it’s ignorant to pretend stuff like that didn’t happen, but be professional, do it on your own time and not in front of clients. "
0,9w539i,t2_p1g0lcr,kmartimcfli,"NTA. Regards of your past, as a medical professional myself, this is unacceptable. If he were alone the whatever but transporting anyone while clocked in to any job really this sounds horrible "
0,amv8ew,t2_1to0qqa2,MikkiTh,"NTA For tonight the moment the arguing starts? Leave. In general, visit when they aren't there & use exams as an excuse. If they complain point out that you attend as much or more than your brother. "
0,b3hvgo,t2_3g3vz7cl,Bob5551234,"NTA. Employee shouldn't have been rude, and if he couldn't authorize an extra 2 hours' parking for a good customer, he should have gone to the manager himself to make the request."
0,b3hvgo,t2_3b99y4ok,binx_au,"NTA - There is no need to be condescending in service. It goads customers into a reaction, which is how I interpreted the scenario. Plus, as best practice given the history of your company with the hotel, the hotel should have already noticed and offered to extend the parking. Service excellence is managing expectations."
0,b3hvgo,t2_2jcujfgd,majesticjules,"NTA If they had extended parking before, it's perfectly reasonable to expect them to do it again. One of managements functions is to make judgements like this. Asking a manager about the parking was the right call."
0,b3hvgo,t2_qzhsx,MakeAutomata,"YTA, just because you were given exceptions in the past doesn't mean you are owed them in the future. You should have KINDLY asked to speak to the manager. Not immediately go into ""We spend x money"" Thats asshole talk, clerks at the counter rarely get to decide when they can break the RULES they had to reexplain to you."
0,b3hvgo,t2_3d3pjchl,drbiddy,YTA. They were just doing their job. If you’re spending so much money just pay for the extra hours. You are every current and former customer service worker’s worst nightmare.
0,b3hvgo,t2_1hxmjo7j,Link2019,YTA- You should of asked for them first. Employee will get blamed if they just do that. Next time talk to him first instead of fighting with the employee
0,b2yfsl,t2_50suk2j,ErrantJune,"NTA. On top of being really un-neighborly, they're putting their dogs at risk. Dogs that run free are at a higher risk for wildlife attack, getting hit by cars, and theft. They're lucky you're just contacting the HOA. In a lot of places letting your dogs off leash is a [misdemeanor crime](https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/is-having-your-dog-off-leash-really-a-misdemeanor--447700.html)."
0,b2yfsl,t2_1r6b8ht2,Tigercatzen,"NTA I don't always agree with HOAs, but this is a situation where the HOA should be the one dealing with it. Your child shouldn't have to be afraid to go outside. Not to mention the neighbors may be violating actual laws, so going to the HOA works in their favor."
0,aw1a97,t2_nyawr,osliver88,"NTA. If he asked for your opinion, he shouldn't be mad that you gave him one and it didn't agree with his. when he responded with agressiveness, though, you probably shoulda just defused it and walked away instead of meeting him with more aggression. "
0,aw1a97,t2_16ihjhtq,bigfatgato,"NTA. He asked you for an honest opinion, and you gave it to him. I adore proofreading essays. I always tell anyone point blank that i will always find faults, so if they’re not willing to have an open mind to real criticism, they can just keep it to themselves. "
0,aw1a97,t2_13orl7ae,Bingalingbean123,"NTA- but there are ways of being honest without being hurtful. If you knew he just wanted validation perhaps just do that next time...or say something like “I love this, this and this, your making excellent points. If I had any criticism I’d change the structure, or try this, this and this. But, what do I know, if you’re happy with it go for it” Having tact when on these circumstances goes a long way. "
0,aw1a97,t2_7krz4,damboy99,"NTA > He had no thesis, all 3 paragraphs did not connect in any sort of ways... All those 3 points did not support any kind of argument at all. Literally the basic fundamentals of an Essay. If it doesn't have a thesis, and your points don't connect it is awful. You can't pass 7th grade English if you write an essay with out a thesis and none of the paragraphs flow together."
0,aw1a97,t2_2g8bx0et,BlindfoldedZerg,"NTA, be honest in your opinion. However, a good technique is to first find the things you like about it (surely there is something there that you like) compliment him on those things, and only then tell him what you think needs improving. Edit: However, even if he uses ""heavy hitting words"" towards you, there is no reason to do ""the same thing back"". You will only make enemies that way. Just leave it there. Now, I'm not saying that you are the asshole if you do retort back, it's just not how you make friends."
0,aiv7nb,t2_1ix4h2xo,SilverDirt,"Definitely NTA The only reason you needed to give is ""im not feeling well"", she should have left it at that. She has no right knowing the details of a medical problem unless youre notorious for skipping (in which case she still doesnt have the right but is at least justified in disbelieving you)"
0,b4ohtf,t2_tymcq,MrSnowflake2,"YTA. Not necessarily for your original comment (we all put our foot in our mouth sometimes), but for the face you didnt back down and drop it the second you got called out. "
0,a4e58y,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,"NTA. Nothing wrong with going through someone's phone. All is fair in love and war. AND....in this situation, the information you got proved to be helpful. Had you taken the common viewpoint of ""it's wrong to look through someone's phone"" or ""you should trust your GF/BF"" then you would have never known, and you would have wasted even more time with her. "
0,a9wlbm,t2_1lvc81je,P_Flange,"NTA. Whenever people have to ignore shit things ""for the good of the group"" it generally means that the group cohesion is fairly tenuous, to begin with. If they couldn't stick up for you then don't feel bad for a second that you left. You deserve better than people who are only your friend when it's easy and convenient. "
0,avxz68,t2_6tx9fq,boomboombipbip,"NTA, this won't be welcome news for the woman, she is more likely to be angry with you. If may also be that she already knows but doesn't think anyone else does and takes comfort in that. You just don't know what you are walking into and you win nothing for giving out this information. "
0,abn4oh,t2_15s3zm,Fengax,NTA. Next time specify that when you give her your login-info it is exclusively for her and not for anyone else.
0,admbml,t2_1huvltuj,ImRikkyBobby,"NTA bro. You are human. You are allowed to be attracted to more than one person. In fact, we are designed to reproduce with more the one partner. Don't feel ashamed for wanting to be with another woman. The only reason people are stuck with ONE partner at a time is because it's a shitty social construct created by assholes to keep us in check. &#x200B; Sit down wit the sister and carefully explain your situation. Don't tell her you have feelings at first. Tell her about your thoughts on your wife. There's no easy way to tell your wife ""hey, maybe you need to lose weight"". etc. &#x200B; &#x200B;"
0,b1i0tc,t2_1xh8u8u6,TmacBoi,"Nta - his depression is starting to impact his relationships negatively, it's time to begin therapy"
0,9z43x5,t2_m52b2,Aurion7,"If it were *your* car, it would be a very clear-cut NTA. It being a shared thing makes it a bit more complicated, but still leaning NTA. There's nothing wrong or even particularly unusual about being a bit uncomfortable driving a car you're not familiar with. Provided you weren't an asshole with how you went about explaining that, you're golden."
0,9z43x5,t2_bt5u0,ogurzhov,"I think NTA. If your sister can easily drive other car if it's available, being the less experienced one you should have a choice of driving a car that you are comfortable with."
0,b64cu1,t2_1p7tx6j0,omygoodnessreally,"NTA Info: where was the bus in relation to you? At the busy/accident prone intersections near me, they put in cameras and you get ticketed...people learned real fast to stop at yellow lights instead of speeding up. It keeps the intersection from being clogged up too (""don't block the box"") (Edited for vote)"
0,azzate,t2_vkzyd20,Min_sora,"NTA - She started it, and it was incredibly inappropriate of her. I might be sensitive, though, having also come from a council estate and having to hear this shit all the time. "
0,azzate,t2_1t2fmzsq,waywardwinchesters79,"NTA. Uwu they’re all so special and clever, because they are learning a useless, dead language! Such a brilliant life skill! No need to learn other stupid, alive languages with people that actually speak it. Who would do such a thing? ^/s"
0,ava5fh,t2_2cgszi17,CadetPOFromHell,"NTA. Childhood indoctrination, stripping kids of critical thinking, denying them education because of Sky Daddy is borderline abusive/cultlike. I normally I have no problem with religion, but forcing it on children is wrong on so many levels."
0,ava5fh,t2_rvvm2,bubblesthehorse,"yta and i say this as a pretty angry atheist myself. When their mother dies, religion will def be one of the things they remember her by. even if your sister agrees to your conditions, you cannot force religion out of these kids, that's just not fair. "
0,ava5fh,t2_emcns,Odeon42,"NTA - But I don't know legally how she could force you to raise them christian after she passes? It's a shitty situation, but in the end not your responsibility."
0,a1i9np,t2_xq7bhw,Sterixx,NTA. When couples choose a destination wedding they should understand that they're taking a risk that some guests won't be able to attend due to financial reasons and life commitments. If they don't understand then they're being unreasonable.
0,a1i9np,t2_2iroygxp,it_snow_problem,"NTA. People who book destination weddings _and_ expect people to come at their expense are assholes. Save your money, say you wish you could be there but can't make it. It takes a serious lack of empathy to expect anyone to drop $2000 to attend your wedding."
0,aun6qc,t2_mqtgk,mayfleur,"NTA. Paying it forward is supposed to be about helping out others because you have the extra means to do so. You guys didn't have the money to pay for twice the people in your party, so it's understandable. "
0,aun6qc,t2_50suk2j,ErrantJune,"NTA. Paying it forward is voluntary. Maybe sometime down the road you'll buy somebody's coffee or cover somebody's check, but you're not in the position to do that right now and that's okay."
0,a8xtll,t2_w97pyo1,AmbulanceDriver3,"NTA. Of course, this is coming from someone who checked out of Christmas gift giving/receiving about 8 years ago and never looked back; so perhaps I don't have the most universally applicable opinion. "
0,b6i6nc,t2_5dgpq7s,Tales_of_reddit,"NTA Your advice didn't come from a place of malice or willful ignorance. If anything, she could do more to help you understand what she's going through."
0,b6i6nc,t2_11iw9s,Jarsky2,"YTA, but a soft YTA since you're open to understanding. A lot of trans people do make the fact that they are trans an integral part of their identity, and it's not right to tell them not to do so."
0,b6i6nc,t2_2t10qucp,MaterialCorgi,"NTA Some people want it both ways. They want the social points for being ""trans"" while simultaneously claiming they're just like any other girl when convenient or best suited to get what they want. Hard to consider someone genuine when they act like that."
0,b6i6nc,t2_anr3c,throwitouts,"NTA, your friend is being overly dramatic when you had a legitimate question/suggestion. It’s easy to say that you were insensitive/ignorant, but your friend needs to use a little sense to see that you were genuinely trying to help/understand, and that it wasn’t an excuse for them to play the victim. "
0,b6i6nc,t2_2fetmmc,donkeynique,"YTA. If you had simply asked why she does it, I'd be firmly NAH. But you do not get to tell her how to identify herself when the fact that she *is* trans is important to her. Listen first, advise second, but do not instruct unprompted."
0,b6i6nc,t2_3e9jq95q,BB_butterfingers,YTA and yes as a cis person you do not understand the importance of the inclusion of “trans” in her title. Good for you that you see her as your feminine equal but her title is not about you. Please say you’re sorry and back off.
0,b8whnf,t2_6e5mb,KissMyGoat,I would say YTA for not allowing them to make their own decisions regarding their own safety. They are not children and they can weigh up the risk vs reward for themselves. You are free to express your concerns without becoming TA but as soon as you tried to guilt them into the course of action you preferred you became TA
0,azbqau,t2_d7p59,bicep123,"NTA Unexpected guests are just that. If you have the food available, great! If not, don't feel obliged to cook for them. You didn't invite them over. >The father replied ""not really"" and looked away. It's also not your fault that they're poor. Don't mistake sympathy for guilt. You have nothing to feel like an asshole about. "
0,azbqau,t2_1kfdjj5y,avocado__dip,"NTA. Chris's parents really made the situation awkward. Why would they think you magically have enough food to feed 4 more people with no notice? Even if you wanted to accommodate them, there was nothing you could do in that time frame."
0,azbqau,t2_2xxij39d,Evie_St_Clair,"NTA. As someone who has been skip-meals-so-the-kids-can-eat-poor I would never, ever try and invite my entire family along to dinner at someone else's house. I honestly wouldn't even want my son eating at your house four times a week, that's just taking advantage. "
0,azbqau,t2_vszx21d,JanuarySoCold,"NTA We grew up poor, dinner was one piece of chicken for everyone. Four extra mouths at the last minute would be impossible to feed. "
0,azbqau,t2_vamq2,Stogamer-5,"NTA as of now. Don’t punish your son or his friend for his family’s issues. You may think it’s no big deal but if your son wanted to hang elsewhere with his friend, he would be already. Keep the status quo otherwise YTA."
0,azbqau,t2_o9jr6tg,bobshallprevail,"YTA not for denying the family a meal but for telling your child not to bring his poor friend over as much because YOU felt guilty and awkward. You had every right not to invite them to dinner, please don't feel bad about that part though. "
0,azbqau,t2_oy7iu2i,grannyknot,NTA I suggest not telling your son how often he can bring his friend around though. You might be really helping out a person in need and helping him avoid a shit show at home. He might wind up being grateful to you his whole life and you might change the course of his in a positive way. 
0,azbqau,t2_39uxxtjt,3ontheteeth,NTA! Why are they being so imposing and weird? ‘Not really’? Way to make an innocent bystander feel guilty for whatever is missing in their lives. That’s pretty rude and you shouldn’t have been subjected to that.
0,azbqau,t2_nagfz,OneTwoWee000,"NTA OP, you’re looking out for your family and cannot afford to provide meals for a family of 5 who shows up at your doorstep. It was tacky for Chris’s family to angle for an invite for dinner. The parents are at fault here — it’s their responsibility to feed their children."
0,a4l295,t2_2gma9niq,iowaclass,NTA but be prepared for her to get tired of it and bail. You are not obligated to listen to her and/or follow her advice. She's not obligated to stay with someone whose habits she finds unbecoming. 
0,a4l295,t2_2et7shtd,AMJ_CSP,NTA.But why are you two even together??? Did you used to be healthier or is she trying to modify you from the original factory specs???
0,9xgcdm,t2_23k77k1q,Kyrinaki,"NTA honestly I would want to know. Your dad may even thank you one day for those photos you took, they might come in handy for court! It sounds like a bit more than a mess, it sounds like a costly bio hazard!"
0,b67ghb,t2_s2acg,Yeangster,"YTA - I personally am not a fan of the concept of giant birthday parties for one-year olds. They also seemed tacky and self-indulgent for me. That said, I feel, and your wife probably does too, that you skipping out early on this one could be a sign or set a precedent for how you prioritize work and family in the future."
0,b67ghb,t2_1wgoxii5,DisneyBride28,"NTA. Careers are very important for supporting your family. If you really feel that going in will make a measurable difference, then I can't blame you. And it's not like your baby will know. Plus he'll be surrounded by family anyway. Being there every day, and providing for him is far more important than having a slice of cake, imo. However if it isn't a big deal to go into work, then it's an asshole move to skip out on your kids 1st bday. "
0,b67ghb,t2_g4hve,bcvickers,"NTA. I view this as putting your family first, by trying to better your position at your company, so that you can be more prepared to provide for your family. Your son isn't going to remember it in any way, shape, or form."
0,b67ghb,t2_r91kw5d,rotti5115,"NTA...family First? Why? Does the family pay the bills? No, longterme its the best you Can do for your family to go to work. He wont remember and when hes older might understand and be thankful for the life you provided for him. Edit: why the shortage on workers? Fired?"
0,b67ghb,t2_15i4bd,Kakiston,"NTA, as long as it's not you skipping the whole thing and instead leaving early/arriving late, first birthdays are always about the parents not the kid and if you feel that this is an important opportunity then take it. A lot of people are using 'work vs family' but this is an isolated incident. "
0,ahjq4v,t2_2ar5cmws,thebligg,NTA but yeah it's a farm and a lot of odd jobs can come up. Having said that it sounds like the owners are complete pricks! I've known plenty of bosses who take advantage of their young/inexperienced workers. Get a new job if you can. 
0,ahjq4v,t2_1s7d9ktu,KingBRbill,"NTA- sounds like an employer taking advantage of someone's inexperience. Im not working one hour if the pay hasnt been explained clearly/set. Nor would I continue working for someone who threatens me in anyway, instead of proper disciplinary actions if I've done something wrong. Find a replacement job as soon as possible and move on. "
0,ba3zvb,t2_1wgoxii5,DisneyBride28,"INFO: I'd love to hear about your and your friends' bodies....I'm assuming you're all fit, muscular and built like Greek gods to be so rude and judgemental of women's bodies, right? Or are you guys some average looking misogynistic dudes? ;) "
0,b7gf0q,t2_2bpuuiv0,inevitablegirlie,"NTA. A 31 year old who is dating a 17 year old is highly likely to be a predator even if they HAVEN'T been convicted of a violent sexual crime. To a normal 31-year-old, a 17-year-old IS. A. CHILD. I can't see how that could be a relationship of equals."
0,b7gf0q,t2_2iejevv1,Caurbine,YTA you allowed it? Why? 17 year old who is attracted to a 31 year old has to have some kind of issues. A 31 year old attracted to a 17 year old is a pedophile. Nobody in this situation sounds mentally healthy enough to deal with this situation 
0,an6bw0,t2_xqxzr,catcog,"NTA You were kind enough to arrange and pay for a room. They don't have to accept your offer. Lots of entitlement-thinking going on here. 1) What you said to Abby was reasonable and they could get accommodations elsewhere. Brent can stay home if other accommodations no longer exist. 2) Frank is a student too (Brent not). 3) Claire & Debby: to bad for them, but not your problem. They can still room with you; they aren't ""out"" anything except by their own choice. &#x200B; &#x200B;"
0,an6bw0,t2_1to0qqa2,MikkiTh,NTA It sounds like they should have clarified and also like they can get a room of their own if necessary. 
0,b6kwb4,t2_iaefe,Chase_In_Sturgis,NTA Try firmly but politely getting your point across by speaking to her in Korean. If that doesn't put a stop to it then talk to the manager because at that point you were more than charitable.
0,b6kwb4,t2_1437ls,ReverseWho,NTA. Report her and complain about the registers being wrong for items on sale. They do it on purpose most of the time because they do not think customers pay attention at check out. False advertising.

0,b01xst,t2_dnrfv,potatosoupofpower,"NTA at all. It sounds like she's intentionally dating someone like you so that she can feel good about ""helping"" or ""saving"" you, but she can't deal with you *actually* getting better, because that upsets the fixer dynamic of the relationship. She needs to feel superior, and needs you to need her help. This honestly sounds really predatory and manipulative."
0,b01xst,t2_3bbreo7n,spacecarrots,"NTA. Why is this suddenly a competition? Unless if you were deliberately stealing her thunder, I don't see why you are wrong here. Also the topic at hand is something you have interest in and thus must have some input; I think it would be rude instead, not to take that chance and say something. She was also not ignored and you tried to bring her in... I really don't see why this is a problem."
0,b01xst,t2_2qwwz0a7,empressofdogs,NTA -- I know a woman like this. She married a man with the personality of a cardboard box because she ALWAYS shines brightly compared to him.

0,b01xst,t2_176vp0,HazelNightengale,"NTA. The most charitable way I could spin this is that she was taken aback by the turnaround. Go to another meet-up or two, keep making the effort to include her, and if she still acts this way...well...not good."
0,b01xst,t2_16sy191o,Berics_Privateer,"NTA If they're her friends, why is it so important for her to 'have the spotlight'? Doesn't she get to see them or talk to them frequently. I feel like we're probably not getting the whole story here, but if we are, maybe she just loves attention?"
0,b01xst,t2_topkl,buddwizard,"NTA- Your GF is incredibly insecure, and knowing your social anxiety it was frankly cruel of her to say that afterwards. She should have been proud of you! People that are insecure can be mean in the moment without thinking, so maybe she will reflect on her actions and take back what she said. "
0,ay6cj0,t2_363j16gy,seenyourscars,"I think YTA if you demand it. So what? Maybe he’s just never felt that need to show off his relationship. I totally get that you might be a bit curious as to the reason why, but once he tells you it’s nothing why not just believe him instead of demanding he posts photos. "

But as for it probably being a mutual first date thing it's always neutrally split half. HOWEVER! You are a dick for talking shit about her being dumb.

A rule requiring employees to speak only English in the workplace at all times, including breaks and lunch time, will rarely be justified. An English-only rule should be limited to the circumstances in which it is needed for the employer to operate safely or efficiently. Circumstances in which an English-only rule may be justified include: communications with customers or coworkers who only speak English; emergencies or other situations in which workers must speak a common language to promote safety; cooperative work assignments in which the English-only rule is needed to promote efficiency. Even if there is a need for an English-only rule, an employer may not take disciplinary action against an employee for violating the rule unless the employer has notified workers about the rule and the consequences of violating it."""

I could be reading too much into it, or your sister just thinks that things she has done for your nephew are reserved only for them and can be nobody else's original idea.

I see your edits to your original post, and I agree that more intensive CBT is needed. Maybe a speech therapist and an occupational therapist, a play therapist could be or help as well. As the boy gets older, maybe an acting coach and a kids acting/theater class might be of help. I dont have any Xp with adoption, but I can read into this that the child needs more help than what has been provided...probably until age 21, if not even longer than that. "

Take this time to work on yourself away from them. Contact them and maybe even talk about it eventually, but only when you're in a comfortable enough headspace to do so."
0,az7l9u,t2_y521l,Callme_Alice,"NTA. You could tell him it was intended as a family outing, but you'd be happy to go with him another time. But in general, him becoming passive-aggressive rather than just telling you that his feelings were hurt is kind of a red flag and makes him TA here. "
0,b5tgo2,t2_3d3pjchl,drbiddy,"NTA. You had a bad experience and you left a review. The problem could’ve easily been handled at the store, but it wasn’t."
0,b5tgo2,t2_yk06i,Robsterclaws,NTA - you work for your money and you shouldn't have to pay for their mistakes. The cashier should have offered to remove the extra item and then charged you for the drink.

0,b5tgo2,t2_mkta0,Rose_Knight789,NTA you handled the situation correctly by leaving a review. The worker could have resolved the issue themselves or the manager could have while you were there.
0,b5tgo2,t2_118qjmsb,BaddestBetch,"NTA, if you work in customer service, the customer comes first ALWAYS. He didn't want to help out and since the ""problem was delt with"" that was probably not his first time being a lazy jerk."
0,b5tgo2,t2_3bm900mg,matapissu,"NTA. The cashier seems that he doesnt give an F about customer service and $5 is a significant amount of money. Also, messing while it's food (and drinks) time is not acceptable"
0,b5tgo2,t2_1blgmhqj,Dandan419,Nta. I work in a restaurant with the public and I would never treat a customer like that. He deserves whatever punishment came to him. 
0,b5tgo2,t2_3s7p1,123draw,NTA. It blows my mind when service employees take stupid fucking stands over issues that should be easily remedied. The cashier chose his hill to die on and frankly you did the owner a favor.
0,b5tgo2,t2_t0gra,Rivka333,"NTA. The owner needs to know about these sorts of things so that he can run his restaurant properly. And if, say, the cashier was well-meaning, maybe new and simply confused, the owner would have been aware of that, and would have taken it into account. "
0,b43kef,t2_iowjcgo,WildlifePolicyChick,"NTA. You are protecting yourself from a cruel and toxic person, and good for you! What kind of sister tells her little brother (or anyone for that matter) to kill themselves? That's horrific. If your parents are whining ""But FAAAAMMMMILY!"" at you, just ignore them. Just because someone is blood does not make them good for you. Keep in touch with your cool siblings, and continue to take care of you."

0,b43kef,t2_f3xns,Halorym,"NTA I don't believe anyone should be judged based on things about themselves they cannot change. Race, sex, age, disability, and even blood. This goes both ways, you don't get a free pass for your immutable characteristics either. You should have every right to disown fucked up family without being judged for it."

And while frankly everyone has the right to live how they wish to live they DO NOT have the right to indoctrinate children into their nonsensical world. You did the right thing and you should do what feels right regarding talking your siblings into making the right decisions for themselves. 
0,9x905y,t2_1xra82le,TitaniumHymen,"YNTA but you need to tell her. And please don't beat yourself up over not stopping him immediately, fighting back, etc. During traumatic moments like that, sometimes the mind just... goes elsewhere, blanks out.

0,a74067,t2_2n8zqvqh,ithinkerno,"NTA. Christmas is severely overdone. That being said, for a lot of people it is important and can be a painful day to spend alone. Not sure how close you are with this guy, but you might want to check in with him over the holidays"
0,b1vq82,t2_1ikhy231,TheBellyBumper,"NTA. Your just looking out for her wellbeing. At that age getting addicted is unbelievably easy and if your going to do drugs, the later the better. And you did warn her. "
0,b1vq82,t2_7a0tat9,saraloverock,"NTA you’re only 17, it’s never a bad idea to inform a parent or responsible adult you can trust, when you’re in a situation that’s too much for you to handle. Especially when it involves a younger child."
0,ai4pe2,t2_2fc7pmk2,Vulturedoors,"NTA. 22 years married and I only call my husband if information needs exchanging, like whether he'll be home for dinner, or how much tp we have in the house.

0,ai4pe2,t2_w8ef2kv,JellyBeansBeam,INFO: how old are the two of you? NTA: if you're at work full time or college and unable to talk all the time. Have a talk about boundaries and set some clear ones for her
0,ai4pe2,t2_2vnskpqc,Iamanamalgam,"NTA. Phone calls are for important information that needs to be confirmed instantly, or to talk to your grandparents if they don't FaceTime. She needs friends, hobbies, and to be comfortable with solitude. It is unfair and unhealthy to expect you to entertain her for hours a day long distance. Be together when you're together, send each other memes, text all you want. "
0,arooyg,t2_yqr56,veggie-princess,"YTA, I grew up with stupid rules like this, (only allowed on the computer for 1 hour a day and only from 5-6 no exceptions) and it just made me resent my mother. "
0,arooyg,t2_2tdkyvo4,tequilathehun,YTA They’re practically adults. They have the right to use their own devices in their own home. Why would you implement any rule saying otherwise? Not to mention the vast majority of kids that age use electronics as the sole way of doing schoolwork or staying in touch with friends when they aren’t able to face-to-face socialize
0,arooyg,t2_1x2gj2qw,BlissfulBlackBear,"YTA. The 16 year old will be an adult soon. You aren't doing him any favors by not allowing him to learn how to properly manage screen time and responsibilities. If he goes to college, he needs those skills. The daughters don't need their phones/computers all night, but should be allowed access to them until around bedtime. Also, I understand being strict. But screwing up your children's change to socialize and develop (which in 2019 a lot of socializing is done with electronic) is borderline abusive. "
0,arooyg,t2_11cn4nfq,garrbl,"YTA. Piling on a bit here, but what you're doing here is at best ensuring they'll resent you for years, and very likely keeping them from being able to learn how to self-control. ""Because I said so,"" which is what your reason amounts to, isn't a good reason for just about anything for a 13 year old, let alone a 16 year old. "
0,arooyg,t2_6hd7lqs,Zeniaaa,"YTA — I understand not wanting your children to be zombies, but your rules are unnecessarily extreme. Why not confiscate phones during homework time and give them back once they are finished? You could also implement rules like “no phones at dinner” or “no phones after 10:00 PM.” I think there is a happy medium here. "
0,arooyg,t2_11baiz,AijeEdTriach,YTA. But here's a compromise you might use. Take the phones around 22.00 every day. Good sleep is very important and they still have plenty of time to use them.
0,arooyg,t2_b5n95,MrCalac123,"YTA, well, maybe that’s a bit harsh but let your kids be kids! Let them play with their friends on Playstation, and let them text their friends, or watch some Youtube! If you really care, make them do homework/chores first. Socializing is heavily digital these days, let them partake in that! Edit: Though this may not be as important of an issue... they may resent you for not letting them use electronics. I’m not saying they will, but they certainly could. I would have absolutely resented my mother for not letting me play. "
0,arooyg,t2_2xxij39d,Evie_St_Clair,YTA. I get adding restrictions around them but it seems an overreaction to confiscate them entirely. Why not take them after school until homework is done and then at bedtime? They're not little kids anymore. 
0,arooyg,t2_no9g7,PsychicAce,"YTA Wtf kind of controlling behaviour is that? Are they giving any signs that the grades would drop if they had their electronics? BTW, you are punishing them. Electronics are a big part of peoples lives today, and should be respected as such. &#x200B; Must be nice to be able to ask all these people their opinion of your device. That you have right now. That isn't locked away."
0,arooyg,t2_hwwhk,cap826,"YTA you’re socially isolating your kids. Growing up we weren’t allowed to watch tv or play video games during the week, which I think is pretty reasonable. Not allowing your kids to talk to their friends during the week is pretty cruel."
0,arooyg,t2_1h5samaz,psam99,"YTA I think this is a generation misunderstanding that happens far too often. Teenagers that age need technology as it is an essential part of their life, it's how they communicate and interact with the world. Give them access to their phones/PlayStation and see what happens, if their grades drop then teach them about responsibly using their phones and gaming. If you have to it is okay to limit access but don't do it unnecessarily, you're currently punishing them from doing nothing wrong."
0,arooyg,t2_qtaeemg,JediAreTakingOver,"YTA - You arent letting them develop their own self-control skills or letting them fail at self-control and learning a lesson. Especially at age 16, where that child will be off to post-secondary in a year or two. Youve shown no trust in your children at all and thats the lesson their going to take with them."
0,arooyg,t2_9mk2w,trytryagainn,"NTA. I would reframe the issue for them that taking away the phones isn't punishment, it's about issues that develop when kids are in front of electronics all of the time. But also, maybe lighten up some, especially the 16 year old. The kids need to learn balance, and they can't if they don't have the opportunity. Maybe something like ""one hour after school"" or ""use if you have homework questions."" Keeping the phones from them during sleeping hours is great idea. "

0,a3kdx6,t2_pqb0b,owlandfinch,"NTA. I can't mow the lawn (because allergies) but I would just offer to trade off other household duties (or cookies, or beer) with someone else if I were in a roommate situation, which is what she should have done if she wanted out of the mowing."
0,akpiv6,t2_2p45ymaa,Background_Fox,"NTA - even taking the ownership issue out the way, the cat clearly needed a vet for a while which your mother didn't do. It's not as though Kitty had found a home where he was well looked after"
0,akpiv6,t2_z8xgm,Lovelyladykaty,"NTA — the nosy part of me would love to see the screenshots, but honestly we don’t need them. Trust your instincts and save you the headache of posting next time. Your mother’s state of mind can no longer be trusted due to the alcoholism wearing away her reason. "
0,9tvesl,t2_ccbui,SnausageFest,"Nta, but your logic here is incomplete. A) theres rarely two choices. Local elections are the best time to look at independent and third party candidates. That's how they get experience to run for larger offices. B) you're not just voting on elected officials. Theres ballot measures that will likely have a bigger impact on your day to day than your representatives."

Nothing wrong with that but from the sounds of it, I don't think this is something that is going to be an easy fix (or can/should be fixed at all TBH).

0,b6yt93,t2_y50cq,TheExarion,"NTA, and I’m inclined to believe this post isn’t real because of how much you seem to remember from this exchange. Most people don’t remember that much from arguments, but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. If your mother is actually like this, you probably need to consult CPS or something dude. That behavior isn’t okay at all and at the very least borders on being abusive."

0,a6jc38,t2_1yvhpw72,galeaphyr,"NTA You’re not obliged to give up your seat for anyone (unless you’re sitting in a clearly marked one for pregnant, elderly, etc). It’s a nice gesture.

0,a6jc38,t2_nw84heo,InBreadDough,"NTA It’s a kind thing to give up the seat, not mandatory. Lack of kindness does not entail rudeness, and when they were rude to you, while you clearly needed the seat makes them the asshole."
0,a6jc38,t2_85c9k,sedatemenow,"NTA. There was a seat available, the pregnant woman had it and gave it up. More than likely, they were ""complaining"" about their feet so they could sit next to each other. Pregnant women can connive also."
